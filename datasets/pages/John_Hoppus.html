<p>When Hoppus was a young man, England had only two universities, Oxford and Cambridge, and they were restricted to <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Anglicans</a>. This led to the emergence of many privately funded independent <a href="/wiki/English_Dissenters" title="English Dissenters">Dissenting</a> academies, many of which functioned as colleges, preparing young men for university studies abroad, in Scotland or on the Continent. In the early nineteenth century, a group of English reformers with <a href="/wiki/Liberal_education" title="Liberal education">liberal educational</a> ideas promoted the idea of a place of further education that might open its doors to men of all religious affiliations or beliefs. This proposal succeeded between 1825–8 with the founding of <a href="/wiki/London_University" title="London University" class="mw-redirect">London University</a>, now <a href="/wiki/University_College_London" title="University College London">University College London</a>, the first entirely <a href="/wiki/Nondenominational" title="Nondenominational" class="mw-redirect">nondenominational</a> college of higher education in England.
</p><p>The new college wanted to establish academic, moral and political philosophy in its curriculum, so it decided, as early as 1827, to appoint two chairs of philosophy – one of Logic and the Philosophy of the Human Mind, and the other of Moral and Political philosophy. The former position was intended to teach students about knowledge and the acquisition of ideas, and the second with translation of this into moral and political human action.
</p><p>Candidates for the two posts were sought in 1827. London University was opposed by the more traditional of the <a href="/wiki/High_church" title="High church">high church</a> sections of <a href="/wiki/The_establishment" title="The establishment" class="mw-redirect">the establishment</a>, and a backlash arose that led to a rival, <a href="/wiki/King%27s_College_London" title="King's College London">King's College London</a> being established. Mindful of their delicate political position, no appointments could be agreed upon for the two key posts of Chairs of Philosophy, either of which might attract a hostile press, eager to undermine the institution for its liberal sentiments, values and ideas.
</p><p>Although <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Southwood_Smith" title="Thomas Southwood Smith">Thomas Southwood Smith</a> and John Hoppus were considered for the two philosophy appointments, the posts were left vacant. <a href="/wiki/George_Grote" title="George Grote">George Grote</a>, one of the promoters of London University, convinced the college that appointment of a Congregational minister such as John Hoppus would imply a religious affiliation, contrary to the institution's nondenominational principles. Grote therefore promoted his own candidate, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hay_Cameron" title="Charles Hay Cameron">Charles Cameron</a>. However, <a href="/wiki/Zachary_Macaulay" title="Zachary Macaulay">Zachary Macaulay</a> and others on the college's Council decided that the teaching of ethics had to have a religious basis (one of the emerging criticisms of the college from its detractors was that it was "an ungodly institution"). Seemingly with the agreement of Grote's two fellow promoters of the college, <a href="/wiki/James_Mill" title="James Mill">James Mill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henry_Brougham,_1st_Baron_Brougham_and_Vaux" title="Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux">Henry Brougham</a>, and whilst Grote was absent (perhaps advisedly so if, as some claim, <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham" title="Jeremy Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a> supported Hoppus' candidature), the College Council recommended Dr John Hoppus for the Chair of Philosophy – which would now become a single academic position, this being perhaps less potent to the college's critics. Grote resigned on 2 February 1830, his concept of the new institution, and the way forward, which he had mistakenly believed would be Bentham's wish, overturned. John Hoppus became the institution's first Professor of Philosophy (Professor of Logic and Mental Philosophy) in 1830; a position he held for over thirty years, until he retired as <a href="/wiki/Emeritus_Professor" title="Emeritus Professor" class="mw-redirect">Emeritus Professor</a> in 1866.
</p><p>His succession was bitterly fought over, as had been his appointment, with some of the same protagonists; but this time Grote (who had been re-elected to the College Council in 1849<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>) was more successful in securing the outcome he wanted (blocking the appointment of <a href="/wiki/James_Martineau" title="James Martineau">James Martineau</a>); and Grote's wife, the writer Harriet Levin, prevailed on the college historian as the new controversy unfolded.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> An altogether unflattering sketch of Dr Hoppus was entered in the college historian's pages, though his contribution has been treated more dispassionately in recent years.

<p>Dr Hoppus was profoundly interested in ideas of <a href="/wiki/Popular_education" title="Popular education">popular education</a> and took a prominent part in the controversy in 1847, seeking establishing of a <a href="/wiki/History_of_education_in_England" title="History of education in England">national educational system</a> to build on the work of the <a href="/wiki/Ragged_schools" title="Ragged schools" class="mw-redirect">ragged schools</a> or <a href="/wiki/Charity_school" title="Charity school">charity schools</a>, and of the <a href="/wiki/Sunday_school" title="Sunday school">Sunday school</a> movement, voluntary bodies that had initiated educational provision for the working classes in the large industrial cities. Dr Hoppus firmly advocated a role for the government in the provision of education – a view then unpopular amongst many in his Dissenting circles who viewed potential government control with suspicion, having been excluded from state education by governments for so long. Though unsuccessful at the time, some twenty years later Hoppus's arguments won the day, and his belief that "no child... be excluded from instruction through the parents' poverty" came to fruition after the renewed campaign by him and others in the 1860s, which led to the <a href="/wiki/Elementary_Education_Act_1870" title="Elementary Education Act 1870">Elementary Education Act 1870</a>.
</p><p>Hoppus worked for the <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Abolitionism in the United Kingdom">abolition of slavery</a>. He chaired the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Board_of_Congregational_Ministers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Board of Congregational Ministers (page does not exist)">Board of Congregational Ministers</a> in 1830 when it passed the following anti-slavery resolution: "That it is the fixed a unanimous opinion of this meeting that of all the rights common to man, those of the person are the most sacred and inviolable; that therefore a state of slavery is a positive, entire, and extreme evil, the nature of which cannot be altered by any meliorating circumstances; that it is, in its mildest forms, destructive of human life, social intercourse, moral character, and intellectual advancement... that this body have always sympathised with the exertions made to abate and abolish this enormous evil..." <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Hoppus's other political interest lay in <a href="/wiki/Animal_welfare" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a>; a number of disparate groups collected under this banner in the 1830s, amongst which he supported the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Rational_Humanity&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rational Humanity (page does not exist)">Rational Humanity</a> campaigners.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
