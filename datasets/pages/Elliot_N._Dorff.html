<p>Among other topics, Dorff is interested in <a href="/wiki/Jewish_philosophy" title="Jewish philosophy">Jewish philosophy</a>. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that addresses questions such as: "What is knowledge?", "How is knowledge acquired?", and "How do we know what we know?" In addressing this subject the first issue to note is that the terms "knowledge" and "belief" are often used interchangeably by religious believers, but technically these are very distinct terms.
</p><p>As a philosopher, Dorff asks about the difference between belief and knowledge. Given the philosophical definition that knowledge differs from belief (knowledge is often defined as a <i>justified, true belief</i>), Dorff's works explicitly analyze <a href="/wiki/Epistemology" title="Epistemology">epistemological questions</a>. His philosophy of religion, as illustrated especially in his book <i>Knowing God: Jewish Journeys to the Unknowable</i>, stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, with careful attention to the grounds of justified belief. He claims, however, that the Jewish tradition did not base its belief in God primarily on intellectual activity because Judaism is theistic, believing in a personal God: just as we do not come to know people through creating proofs of their existence, so too that has not been the primary way in which Jews have come to know God. Instead, to know people we talk with them and do things with them, and the same is true for how we come to know God: We talk to God through prayer; God talks to us through revelation; we do things with God through following God's commandments; and God does things with us by acting in history. In Knowing God there is a chapter on each of those aspects of the interaction that gives us knowledge of God.
</p><p>In his book <i>Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors to Our Descendants</i>, Dorff creates and then explains a chart of various views of revelation and Jewish law, including the mainstream Orthodox approach, four Conservative approaches, and the Reform approach. In it he describes himself as "Conservative III," according to which revelation holds no content in of itself; rather, God inspired people with His presence by coming into contact with them. In this view the Bible is a human response to our ancestors' encounters with God, and revelation continues each time we study and reinterpret Jewish classical texts.

<p>In the spring of 1993, Dorff served on the ethics committee of <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton" class="mw-redirect">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>'s Health Care Task Force, and in March 1997 and May 1999, he, along with other rabbis, testified on behalf on the Jewish tradition on the subjects of human cloning and stem cell research before the president's National Bioethics Advisory Commission. In 1999-2000, he served on the U.S. Surgeon General's Task Force to create a Call to Action for responsible sexual behavior, and between 2000-2002 he served on the National Human Resources Protections Advisory Commission, charged with reviewing and revising the federal guidelines on research on human beings. He is now on the California Ethics Advisory Commission for embryonic stem cell research done within the state.
</p><p>Dorff is a fellow of the <a href="/wiki/Hastings_Center" title="Hastings Center" class="mw-redirect">Hastings Center</a>, a preeminent research institution dedicated to the examination of issues in bioethics.

<p>Dorff has written several anthologies on Jewish ethics and theologies with his co-author, <a href="/wiki/Carleton_College" title="Carleton College">Carleton College</a> religion professor <a href="/wiki/Louis_E._Newman" title="Louis E. Newman">Louis E. Newman</a>. In addition, he has written books on social ethics (To Do the Right and the Good, and The Way into Tikkun Olam [Repairing the World]) and personal ethics (Love Your Neighbor and Yourself). His books on social ethics include chapters on interfaith relations, pluralism within the Jewish community, poverty, justice, war, and communal forgiveness. His book on personal ethics includes chapters on privacy, sexual ethics, family violence, how we talk to and about each other, parents and children, and hope. 
</p><p>In addition to these chapters on specific areas of ethics, Dorff has written extensively on issues in ethical theory—in particular, the relationships between religion and ethics and between Jewish law and ethics.  These can be found in the first chapters and the appendicies of the books mentioned above as well as in his book on Jewish law, described below.

<p>Dorff is a rare example of someone who has written about the theory of Jewish law and has also written rabbinic rulings (teshuvot) on a number of issues in Jewish law. In his book <i>The Unfolding Tradition</i>, he describes and analyzes fifteen theories of Jewish law within the Conservative Movement with comparisons to theories on the right in Orthodoxy and on the left in Reform Judaism and yet further left. He articulates his own theory of Jewish law as a living, organic system in his book <i>For the Love of God and People: A Philosophy of Jewish Law</i>. In addition to describing how he understands Jewish law as being like a human being with a body (=the body of Jewish law, the corpus juris) and soul (=the Covenant between God and the Jewish People), he has specific chapters on the interaction between Jewish law and morality, theology, and custom, followed by some comparisons to the right and left of his approach and some specific examples of his own rabbinic rulings that illustrate his theory.
