He began publicly connecting <a href="/wiki/Lin_Biao" title="Lin Biao">Lin Biao</a>, the fallen Chinese leader now condemned as a rightist, with Confucius, who had long been campaigned against.  Yang connected not only Lin, but also generalized <a href="/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi" title="Liu Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a> and other ousted leaders as Confucian followers.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>  Confucius was a more significant target than before, however, and was a stand-in for Premier <a href="/wiki/Zhou_Enlai" title="Zhou Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a>, who was not criticized by name.  Among Yang Rongguo's points was that Confucius had suppressed societal changes in his era, and that Zhou Enlai had been doing similar things by working towards the rehabilitation of ousted CCP leaders in 1972, including <a href="/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
