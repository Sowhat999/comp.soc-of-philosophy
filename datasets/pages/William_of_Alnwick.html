<p><b>William of Alnwick</b> (lat. <b>Guillelmus Alaunovicanus</b>, c. 1275 â€“ March 1333) was a <a href="/wiki/Franciscan" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> <a href="/wiki/Friar" title="Friar">friar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theologian" title="Theologian" class="mw-redirect">theologian</a>, and bishop of <a href="/wiki/Giovinazzo" title="Giovinazzo">Giovinazzo</a>, who took his name from <a href="/wiki/Alnwick" title="Alnwick">Alnwick</a> in Northumberland. 
</p><p>Little is known of his early life. By 1303 he was a licensed doctor of theology at Paris, being then listed among the few foreign masters who sided with <a href="/wiki/Philip_IV_of_France" title="Philip IV of France">Philip IV</a>, king of France, in his dispute with <a href="/wiki/Pope_Boniface_VIII" title="Pope Boniface VIII">Pope Boniface VIII</a>. Alnwick also lectured at other European centres of learning, including <a href="/wiki/Montpellier" title="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bologna" title="Bologna">Bologna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Naples" title="Naples">Naples</a>. He must have returned to England sometime in the second decade of the 14th century, as he is recorded as the forty-second Franciscan <a href="/wiki/Regent_master" title="Regent master">regent master</a> at Oxford University, when <a href="/wiki/Henry_Harclay" title="Henry Harclay">Henry Harclay</a> was chancellor of the university.
</p><p>Alnwick's manuscript marginalia show that he was part of the contemporary debate which spread all over Europe, and which included the ideas of men such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bonaventure" title="Bonaventure">Bonaventure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_of_Ghent" title="Henry of Ghent">Henry of Ghent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Auriol" title="Peter Auriol" class="mw-redirect">Peter Auriol</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=James_of_Ascoli&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="James of Ascoli (page does not exist)">James of Ascoli</a>, <a href="/wiki/Godfrey_of_Fontaines" title="Godfrey of Fontaines">Godfrey of Fontaines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Harclay" title="Henry Harclay">Henry Harclay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wilton" title="Thomas Wilton">Thomas Wilton</a>. His main collaborator, however, was <a href="/wiki/Duns_Scotus" title="Duns Scotus">Duns Scotus</a>, and it is this that has saved him from obscurity.
</p><p>He worked with Scotus in the production of his Commentary on the <i>Sentences</i> (<i>Ordinatio</i>), took down one of his <i>Collationes</i>, and compiled the long additions (<i>Additiones magnae</i>) which were meant to fill the gaps in the <i>Ordinatio</i>. But although Alnwick based his philosophy and theology on the fundamental starting points of Scotus's teaching, he diverged from his colleague when he disagreed.
</p><p>Alnwick participated in the general chapter of the Franciscan order held at <a href="/wiki/Perugia" title="Perugia">Perugia</a> in 1322, where he joined the theologians who drew up and signed the decree <i>De paupertate Christi</i> attacking the position on the poverty of the church as promulgated by <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_XXII" title="Pope John XXII">Pope John XXII</a>. In the last section of his <i>Determinationes</i> he argued that Christ and his apostles possessed nothing either personally or in common. This opposition to the papal position caused John to initiate proceedings against Alnwick, who fled to Naples, where <a href="/wiki/Robert_of_Naples" title="Robert of Naples" class="mw-redirect">King Robert</a> protected him. In 1330, Robert had him appointed bishop of <a href="/wiki/Giovinazzo" title="Giovinazzo">Giovinazzo</a>.
</p><p>He died in <a href="/wiki/Avignon" title="Avignon">Avignon</a> in March 1333.
