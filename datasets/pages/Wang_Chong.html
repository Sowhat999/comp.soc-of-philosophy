<p>Wang Chong reacted to the state that philosophy had reached in China. <a href="/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">Daoism</a> had long ago degenerated into superstition and magic, and <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> had been the state religion for some 150 years. <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Laozi" title="Laozi">Laozi</a> were worshipped as gods, omens were seen everywhere, belief in ghosts was almost universal, and <a href="/wiki/Fengshui" title="Fengshui" class="mw-redirect">fengshui</a> had begun to rule people's lives.  Wang derided all this and made a vocation of giving a rational, naturalistic account of the world and the human place in it.
</p><p>At the centre of his thought was the denial that Heaven has any purpose for us, whether benevolent or hostile. To say that Heaven provides us food and clothing is to say it acts as our farmer or tailor — an obvious absurdity.  Humans are insignificant specks in the universe and cannot hope to effect changes in it, and it is ludicrous arrogance to think that the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a> would change itself for us.
</p><p>Wang insisted that the words of previous sages should be treated critically, and that they were often contradictory  or inconsistent. He criticized scholars of his time for not accepting this, as well as what he called the popular acceptance of written works. He believed that the truth could be discovered, and would become obvious, by making the words clear, and by clear commentary on the text.
</p><p>One example of Wang's <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a> is his argument that thunder must be caused by fire or heat, and is not a sign of the heavens being displeased. He argued that repeatable experience and experiment should be tried before adopting the belief that divine will was involved.
</p><p>He was equally scathing about the popular belief in ghosts.  Why should only human beings have ghosts, he asked, not other animals?  We are all living creatures, animated by the same vital principle. Besides, so many people have died that their ghosts would vastly outnumber living people; the world would be swamped by them. He never, however, explicitly denies the existence of ghosts (<i>gui</i> 鬼) or spirits (<i>shen</i> 神), he simply separates them from the notion that they are the souls of the dead. He seems to believe that the phenomena exist, but whatever they may be, they have no relation to the deceased.
</p>
<blockquote>People say that spirits are the souls of dead men. That being the case, spirits should always appear naked, for surely it is not contended that clothes have souls as well as men. (<i>Lunheng</i>)</blockquote>
<p>Wang was just as rational and uncompromising about knowledge. Beliefs require evidence, just as actions require results. Anyone can prattle nonsense, and they'll always be able to find people to believe it, especially if they can dress it up in superstitious flummery. Careful reasoning and experience of the world are needed.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Bernhard_Karlgren" title="Bernhard Karlgren">Bernhard Karlgren</a> called his style straightforward and without literary pretensions; in general, modern western writers have noted that Wang was one of the most original thinkers of his time, even iconoclastic in his opinions. They note that he gained popularity in the early 20th century because his ideas correspond to those that later evolved in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. His writing is praised for being clear and well ordered. But, because there was no functioning <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> or larger scientific discourse in his time, his formulations can seem alien to the modern eye — to some readers, even as peculiar as the superstitions that he was rejecting. But despite this barrier to his work, he gained some fame, though mostly after his death. He had an effect on what Karlgren called, the 'neo-Daoism’ — a reformed Daoist philosophy with a more rational, naturalistic metaphysics, without much of the superstition and mysticism into which Daoism had fallen.

But in such cases as landslides and earthquakes, what does the consuming then?<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_412_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_412-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<blockquote class="templatequote">Other scholars say that when the sun is eclipsed, the moon covers it. The sun is further away (lit. above) but the moon being nearer (lit. below), then the moon could not cover the sun. But since the opposite is true, the sun is obstructed, its light is covered by that of the moon, and therefore a solar eclipse is caused. Just as, in gloomy weather, neither sun nor moon can be seen. When the edges contact, the two consume each other; when the two are concentric they face each other exactly covered and the sun is nearly extinguished. That the sun and moon are in conjunction at times of new moon is simply one of the regulatories of the heavens.<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_412_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_412-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote">But that the moon covers the light of the sun in solar eclipses — no, that is not true. How can this be verified? When the sun and the moon are in conjunction and the light of the former is 'covered' by the latter, the edges of the two must meet at the beginning, and when the light reappears they must have changed places. Suppose the sun is in the east and the moon is in the west. The moon falls back (lit. moves) quickly eastwards and meets the sun, 'covering' its edge. Soon the moon going on eastwards passes the sun. When the western edge (of the sun), which has been 'covered' first, shines again with its light, the eastern edge, which was not 'covered' before, should (now) be 'covered'. But in fact we see that during an eclipse of the sun the light of the western edge is extinguished, yet when (the light) comes back the western edge is bright (but the eastern edge is bright also). The moon goes on and covers the eastern (inner) part as well as the western (inner) part. This is called 'exact intrustion' and 'mutual covering and obscuring'. How can these facts be explained (by astronomers who believe that the moon covers the light of the sun in solar eclipse).<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_412_413_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_412_413-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<blockquote class="templatequote">Again, the scholars assert that the bodies of the sun and moon are quite spherical. When one looks up at them, their shape seems like that of a ladle or a round basket, perfectly circular. They are not the qi of a light seen from far off, for qi could not be round. But (my opinion is) that in fact the sun and moon are not spherical; they only appear to be so on account of the distance. How can this be verified? The sun is the essence of fire, the moon the essence of water. On earth, fire and water never assume spherical forms, so why should they become spherical only in the heavens? The sun and moon are like the five planets, and these in turn like the other stars. Now the other stars are not really round, but only appear to be so in their shining, because they are so far away. How do we know this? In the <a href="/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Period" title="Spring and Autumn Period" class="mw-redirect">Spring and Autumn Period</a>, stars fell down (upon the earth) at the capital of the <a href="/wiki/Song_(state)" title="Song (state)">State of Song</a>. When people went near to examine them, it turned out that they were stones, but not round. Since these (shooting) stars were not round, we may be sure that the sun, the moon, and the planets are not spherical either.<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_413_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_413-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Although Wang Chong was certain of his ideas about eclipses (without the knowledge of how <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> forms naturally large spherical bodies in space), his ideas on this would not be later accepted in China. Although there were some figures like <i>Liu Chi</i>, writing in his Lun Tian (Discourse on the Heavens) of 274 AD that supported Wang's theory by arguing the inferior Yin (moon) could never obstruct the superior Yang (sun),<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_414_415_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_414_415-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Liu was still outside of the mainstream accepted Confucian tradition. The <a href="/wiki/Song_Dynasty" title="Song Dynasty" class="mw-redirect">Song Dynasty</a> (960-1279) scientist <a href="/wiki/Shen_Kuo" title="Shen Kuo">Shen Kuo</a> (1031–1095) supported the old theory of a spherical sun and moon by using his own reasoning about eclipses, which he explained were due to the moon and the sun coming into obstruction of one another.<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_415_416_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_415_416-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The Chinese philosopher <a href="/wiki/Zhu_Xi" title="Zhu Xi">Zhu Xi</a> (1130–1200) also supported this theory in his writing.<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_416_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_416-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Although Wang Chong was right about the water cycle and other aspects of early science, his stern opposition to mainstream Confucian thought at the time made him a skeptic of all their theories, including eclipses (the Confucian-accepted model being correct).<sup id="cite_ref-needham_volume_3_413_414_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-needham_volume_3_413_414-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
