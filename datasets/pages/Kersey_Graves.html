According to one source, Graves did not attend school for more than three or four months in his life,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> but another source says that he received an "academical education", and at the age of 19 was teaching in a school at Richmond, a career he was to follow for more than twenty years.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>He was an advocate of <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">Abolitionism</a> was also interested in language reform, and became involved with a number of radical <a href="/wiki/Freethinkers" title="Freethinkers" class="mw-redirect">freethinkers</a> within Quakerism. In August 1844, he joined a group of about fifty <a href="/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia">utopian</a> settlers in <a href="/wiki/Wayne_County,_Indiana" title="Wayne County, Indiana">Wayne County, Indiana</a>. In the same month, he was disowned by his Quaker meeting group due to his neglect of attendance, and also setting up a rival group. The groups he was associated with later dabbled in <a href="/wiki/Mesmerism" title="Mesmerism" class="mw-redirect">mesmerism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spiritualism_(religious_movement)" title="Spiritualism (religious movement)" class="mw-redirect">spiritualism</a>.
</p><p>In July 1845, Graves married the Quaker, Lydia Michiner, at Goschen Meeting House, in <a href="/wiki/Zanesfield,_Ohio" title="Zanesfield, Ohio">Zanesfield, Logan County, Ohio</a>, and they later had five children at their home in <a href="/wiki/Harveysburg,_Ohio" title="Harveysburg, Ohio">Harveysburg, Ohio</a>. They later moved back to Richmond and bought a farm.
</p><p>The Goschen Meeting House was a centre of the Congregational Friends and were involved with Temperance and Peace, health reform, anti-slavery, women's rights and socialistic utopianism.
</p><p>Graves' <a href="/wiki/Quaker" title="Quaker" class="mw-redirect">Quaker</a> background conditioned him to the philosophy of the <a href="/wiki/Inner_light" title="Inner light">Inner light</a>, whereby all clergy, creeds, and set liturgy in worship were irrelevant, and a hindrance to God's work.
