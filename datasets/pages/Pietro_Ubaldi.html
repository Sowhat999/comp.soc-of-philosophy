<p>Ubaldi was graduated in Law and Music, at Rome. Fluent in English, French, <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a>, Spanish and <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, in addition to his native Italian, he also knew <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek language</a>. A student of various philosophical and religious traditions, he distinguished himself as a <a href="/wiki/Christian_religion" title="Christian religion" class="mw-redirect">Christian</a> thinker. He had two sons, Agnese and Franco, who died during the second world war. His Christian belief was not only an intellectual question, but a global dimension, something deeply connected with all his being. A descendant of one of the most renowned and ancient families of <a href="/wiki/Umbria" title="Umbria">Umbria</a> (the Italian region where <a href="/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi" title="Saint Francis of Assisi" class="mw-redirect">Saint Francis of Assisi</a> was born), he renounced richness to be faithful to the <a href="/wiki/Gospel" title="Gospel">Gospel</a>. So he was obliged to find a job to live. First he went to <a href="/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> to teach English in a secondary school, then, always as a teacher, he went to <a href="/wiki/Gubbio" title="Gubbio">Gubbio</a> (Umbria), where he lived twenty years.
</p><p>He authored 24 books: 12 in Italy and 12 in Brazil. Remarkable for anticipating by a few decades philosophical and scientific concepts later formalized by traditional sciences, including findings by <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Great_Synthesis" title="The Great Synthesis" class="mw-redirect">The Great Synthesis</a></i>, describing, among other themes, the unitary aspect of the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a> and its consequences to spiritual evolution, is considered one of his principal works. He received the first inspiration for this book at the age of 27 years at <a href="/wiki/Falconara_Marittima" title="Falconara Marittima">Falconara</a> (<a href="/wiki/Marche" title="Marche">Marche</a>). One day, on the seashore, he got the enlightenment that made him perceive the essence of the universe. He felt that <a href="/wiki/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a>, energy and <a href="/wiki/Spirit" title="Spirit">spirit</a> are different aspects of the same Substance and that their difference is a "kinetic difference", as he states, that is of movement: rotatory as regards matter, wave-like as regards energy, whirling as regards <a href="/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)" title="Psyche (psychology)">psyche</a>.
