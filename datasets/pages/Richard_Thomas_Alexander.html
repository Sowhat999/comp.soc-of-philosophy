<p>Richard Alexander was born on July 3, 1887, in <a href="/wiki/Smicksburg,_Pennsylvania" title="Smicksburg, Pennsylvania">Smicksburg, Pennsylvania</a>, to Mary Elizabeth Wilhelm Alexander and William John Alexander, one of four children. He had two older brothers, John Wilhelm Alexander and Wallace P. Alexander, and a younger sister, Ethel M. Alexander.<sup id="cite_ref-lucero_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lucero-1">[1]</a></sup> A move to <a href="/wiki/Kirksville,_Missouri" title="Kirksville, Missouri">Kirksville, Missouri</a> was precipitated by a tenuous family situation that led to the separation of young Thomas's parents when he was very young. William John Alexander, who was at one time President of Beaver College (now <a href="/wiki/Arcadia_University" title="Arcadia University">Arcadia University</a>) in <a href="/wiki/Beaver,_Pennsylvania" title="Beaver, Pennsylvania">Beaver, Pennsylvania</a>, ended up in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco,_California" title="San Francisco, California" class="mw-redirect">San Francisco, California</a>, where he died in 1926. The relationship Richard Alexander had with is father is not known, as there was little contact between them. By the age of 14, he was enrolled in the Kirksville Public School system graduating from Kirksville Public High School at the age of 16 in 1903. He attended the First District Normal School (later, <a href="/wiki/Truman_State_University" title="Truman State University">Truman State University</a>) in Kirksville, graduating with a Bachelor of Pedagogy (Pd.B.) in 1905 and later receiving a Master of Pedagogy (M.Pd) in 1907. While working on his <a href="/wiki/Master%27s_degree" title="Master's degree">master's degree</a>, he taught in Kirksville, rising to the role of <a href="/wiki/Principal_(school)" title="Principal (school)" class="mw-redirect">principal</a> by 1906.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Alexander applied to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Missouri" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a> only to find disappointment when he was told he would not be given credit for the work he had done at the normal school. Alexander started Columbia University studying German on September 25, 1907 on a trial basis.
</p><p>Coming from a rural setting, Alexander did not let himself be bored in the big city.  He obtained employment during the week downtown as an usher in the theater district, including the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera_House_(Lincoln_Center)" title="Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)">Metropolitan Opera House</a>.  It was very good pay, however most of the performances were at night which ordinarily might interfere with studies.   Alexander sensibly saw an advantage to the situation. Reminiscing years later to his son,  Alexander said there wasn’t much work to do as an usher.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>  He went down to the theater every night at a certain time, showed people to their seats, and after the first act started, he was basically finished.  After seeing the show a few times he then took a book to study and read.  Later in his life he would tell students that if you must get a job, try to get one where you would have the opportunity to learn something. Alexander knew that every experience could be a learning moment. In finding employment, even part-time, one should seek a position where the brain is challenged rather than numbed in robotic drudgery. Alexander always advocated pedagogy of “lifelong learning” and lived it as an example of a positive life choice. 
</p><p>After receiving the undergraduate credit he sought, Alexander applied and received a year’s leave of absence to spend the 1908-1909 school year teaching overseas and studying German at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Jena" title="University of Jena">University of Jena</a> with Professor <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Rein" title="Wilhelm Rein">Wilhelm Rein</a>. He had obtained employment teaching science at <a href="/wiki/Robert_College" title="Robert College">Robert College</a>, a boy’s school in <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, until the <a href="/wiki/Adana_Massacre" title="Adana Massacre" class="mw-redirect">Adana Massacre</a><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> prompted him to Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Returning to New York, Alexander completed all the academic requirements to graduate in 1909, but had to wait until, 1910, to receive his <a href="/wiki/A.B." title="A.B." class="mw-redirect">A.B. diploma</a> because of a certain physical education requirement. Alexander needed to demonstrate his ability to swim the length of a pool and receive a certificate of completion.  It was not that he did not know how to swim; he just thought the requirement was silly and so he put it off until it was too late to register for the 1909 commencement.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>  This event caused Alexander to think that there was something seriously wrong with an education curriculum that was so structured.  The philosopher <a href="/wiki/Mortimer_J._Adler" title="Mortimer J. Adler">Dr. Mortimer J. Adler</a> suffered a similar fate as he failed to pass the required swimming test for a bachelor's degree at Columbia College.  Like Alexander, he considered it a nuisance.  Adler never received his A.B. degree, but so impressed the faculty he was allowed into graduate school to complete his doctorate in psychiatry.  Dr. Adler later received his A. B. degree in 1983.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Alexander accepted a position teaching science at Heathcote School(also known as Heathcote Hall) in <a href="/wiki/Harrison,_New_York" title="Harrison, New York">Harrison</a>, <a href="/wiki/Westchester_County" title="Westchester County" class="mw-redirect">Westchester County</a>, New York, about twenty-five miles north from Manhattan.  This was a private boarding school for young boys. During the summer break Alexander returned to Europe to continue his graduate studies. At Columbia University he skipped the desire to complete a master’s program and registered as a doctoral student with Dr. <a href="/wiki/Paul_Monroe" title="Paul Monroe">Paul Monroe</a> during which time he was also a graduate assistant to Dr. <a href="/wiki/Edward_L._Thorndike" title="Edward L. Thorndike" class="mw-redirect">Edward L. Thorndike</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>1n 1914, Alexander received an appointment to the George Peabody College for Teachers, in Nashville, TN. It let him solidify some of his thoughts about teacher education, the concept of community, and curriculum theory.  It would show him that the logistics of starting a school within a school is very feasible.  It would also introduce him to a couple of people who would forever change his life, Grace Elizabeth Andrews, his future wife, and <a href="/wiki/William_Fletcher_Russell" title="William Fletcher Russell">William Fletcher Russell</a>, son of Teachers College Dean James Earl Russell.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The next year, 1915, was significant for Alexander in that he would receive academic acclaim as the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Peabody_Demonstration_School" title="Peabody Demonstration School" class="mw-redirect">Peabody Demonstration School</a> and a contributor to the establishment of the Knapp Farm. The school lasted as a part of the Peabody College campus until 1974, when the college decided to close it. Afterwards, a sympathetic group of parents, alumni, students and teachers re-formed the demonstration school as the University School of Nashville, a non-profit, independent institution.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Alexander completed his dissertation and received his doctorate in 1916, submitting his dissertation entitled The Prussian Elementary Schools.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The work, a detailed description of Prussian educational practices before the war, was published in book form in 1919. This is significant because, Alexander’s next major work, (co-written with Beryl Parker) entitled The New Education in the German Republic, offered a detailed description of German education after the war, in contrast to his first book. 
</p><p>Alexander and Russell spent three years in Nashville together at one time briefly sharing an apartment until Russell left in 1917 to become Dean of the College of Education at the State University of Iowa. In 1923 Russell became a professor of education and associate director of the International Institute at Teachers College until he succeeded his father as Dean of Teachers College in 1927. It was Russell that brought Alexander to the faculty at Columbia as part of the International Institute and later, it was Russell who approved the creation of New College.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>In 1923, Russell left Iowa to accept the position of Associate Director of the International Institute of Teachers College, with Paul Monroe as Director.

Alexander was the German expert at the institute and as such he returned to Europe many times and cultivated friendships with Dr. Fritz Karsen,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Dr. Franz Hilker, Dr. Peter Petersen, Paul Geheeb,  and <a href="/wiki/Adolphe_Ferriere" title="Adolphe Ferriere" class="mw-redirect">Adolphe Ferriere</a>.

<p>All of Alexander’s experiences thus far convinced him that a new type of teachers college was necessary to address the social issues of the day. Originally, New College’s progressive foundations, its philosophical origins, and its influences were the Concept of Community, Critical Pedagogy, and German Progressive Education.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> After the planning for the new college began, the United States suffered the economic upheaval that was the Great Depression. Resulting influences then included Social Reconstruction<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> and Student Activism.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>There was a planned departure from traditional teacher-training institutions by placing special emphasis on child nature and development through experiences designed to give the student an insight into the problems of contemporary social life. Alexander sought to develop a critical consciousness in his students for intellectually based social leadership and provide guidance in effectually meeting the universally persistent problems of living, that is, the essential problems of living that students and in reality, all humans, would face in all stages of their development as individuals, as members of social groups, and as teachers of children and adults. Using innovative ideas such as extended foreign study, community-based active research, and authentic assessment, a portfolio-based undergraduate learning curriculum was developed which rejected traditional summative grades or the accumulation of credits as the basis of degree completion.
</p><p>The logistics and managerial challenges of starting an institution of higher learning from the ground up must have been daunting. It was here that Alexander proved himself to be an organizational genius. His handprint was on everything, from finding classrooms and dormitories to the formation of the curriculum and the selection of the initial faculty and first students.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The worsening socio-economic atmosphere fueled the rise of communism and socialism in America’s cities. In the world, New College students saw the rise of Hitler in Germany, Japanese aggression in Manchuria, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War.  As a result, many New College students became politically active, encouraged by the philosophy of community-based active research. Some students, avowed communists and socialists, were given “credit” and in one case, a scholarship,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> for organizing and participating in demonstrations, protests and pickets.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 
</p><p>By 1938, Dean William F. Russell had to decide that the experimental institution was a financial failure.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Indeed, the figures in the budget were very clear. New College was in a continual state of deficit spending, but then again, so was every other college or university in the United States, Teachers College included. A college or university that ran in the black during the Depression was a rarity.
Although notoriously apolitical, Alexander found himself governing the college through a highly politicized decade steeped in extreme idealism calling for social action. Alexander didn’t consider himself a “progressive” or an iconic figure of reform like Kilpatrick or Counts, but rather he was an educator who knew that the teacher, a competent and cultured one, makes the difference in any community or society. Because he never liked to play the political game the extreme left would accuse him of anti-Semitism and being a secret Nazi sympathizer, while the extreme right would hold up his college, the reflection of his educational philosophy, as an example of communist infiltration in higher education. 
New College closed in 1939.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="World_War_II_.281939-1946.29">World War II (1939-1946)</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Richard_Thomas_Alexander&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: World War II (1939-1946)">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The closing of New College hit Alexander hard. Although, still technically a member of the Teachers College faculty, he spent the war years teaching sporadically and helping other New College faculty in their endeavors to keep the college’s unique philosophy alive. Had New College not existed, Alexander may very well have been regarded as an early pioneer of comparative education, along with Kandel,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> especially through his close friendship with Drs. Franz Hilker and Friedrich Schneider, who both were highly regarded in the burgeoning field of comparative education.  The innovation of foreign study as a requirement lived on in Dr. Agnes Snyder, who soon left after the closing of New College, eventually becoming the chairman of the Department of Education at Adelphi College.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> In this position she called on Alexander to renew his vision of New College through Adelphi's New Teachers Education Program (ANTEP), which required foreign study as part of the program.
</p><p>Later, in a letter to alumni of New College, Thomas Alexander wrote that in 1945 "at a dinner in my home one night, William Russell said, 'Tom, the biggest mistake in my life was to close New College’.  Dr. Alexander answered, ‘It’s a hell of a time to find that out’.”<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p>Richard Thomas Alexander purchased the land where the New College Community was near Canton, North Carolina, where he lived until his death on October 16, 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-George_4-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-George-4">[4]</a></sup>

The attempts were not successful partly due to Alexander's non-political nature. Echoing his intransigence to non-educational aims, Alexander and Taylor did not try to reach out to political allies who might help them but rather chose their counterparts in Germany, secondary education scholars. The unwillingness of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church and other Christian entities to accept a one-track school system because of concerns about lowered standards soon discredited the American attempt to reform German education, which was effectively abandoned in 1948.<sup id="cite_ref-tent_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-tent-20">[20]</a></sup> For his efforts, nonetheless, Alexander was awarded a medal by the German Government.
