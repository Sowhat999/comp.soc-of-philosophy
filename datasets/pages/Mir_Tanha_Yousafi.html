<p>Mir Tanha Yousufi started his literary voyage as an Urdu poet. Since 1972, when he was an undergraduate science student, he kept sending his ghazals and poems to various literary magazines and literary pages of national news papers.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_in_Urdu">Work in Urdu</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Work in Urdu">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>From 1986 onwards he continued contributing poems, ghazals and short stories to Urdu magazines including:
“Fanoon (Lahore)” edited by late Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi,
“Takhleeq (Lahore)” edited by Azhar Javed,
"Moaasir (Lahore)” edited by Ata-ul-Haq Qasimi,
“Adabiyat (Pakistan Academy of Letters' quarterly magazine) and
“Kitab (Literary magazine of Pakistan Book Foundation).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Urdu_poetry">Urdu poetry</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Urdu poetry">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>His first Urdu poetry collection “Luknat(Fumbling)" was published in 1996. It contains modern as well as traditionally styled ghazals with a handful of poems (free versed as well as metered). The book was received with a critical acclaim and appreciation from the contemporary men of letters.
</p><p>Second collection of Urdu poetry is ready to go to the press. The contents of this book would be styled similar to the "Luknat". A good portion of this next Urdu poetry collection has already been contributed to various magazines.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Urdu_prose">Urdu prose</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Urdu prose">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Although Yousufi has a good number of Urdu short stories; both in post modern and plain traditional style, yet the matter is not sufficient enough to be presented in the form of a book. He does believe in quantity, yet he feel that quality is of prime importance which is a must for any creative piece of work.
A few of his Urdu Afsanas have been published in magazines.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Punjabi_work">Punjabi work</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Punjabi work">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Punjabi being his mother tongue; it was but natural to keep moving between Urdu poetry to Punjabi poetry. This drove him to write Punjabi prose as well, which he did with consistency and ended up with the publication of his first book in Punjabi. Some of these magazines are listed as:
“Sver International” edited by Jamil Paul,
“Rvel” and “Meeti” edited by Ilyas Ghumman,
“Lehraan” edited by Akhter Hussain Akhter and
"Pancham" edited by Saqib Maqsood.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Punjabi_prose">Punjabi prose</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Punjabi prose">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Yousufi's first Punjabi short story collection “Sooraj Uggan Taa’en [Till the Sun Rises]" was published in 1996. This book proved to be his introduction in Punjabi literary world.
</p><p>And here entered Ilyas Ghumman in his life. Ilyas Ghumman, an electrical engineer by profession, is a Lahore based renowned Punjabi writer, worker and publisher. He has a world fame for organising events regarding the development and progress of Punjabi language, literature and culture. He asked Yousufi to try his pen for writing down some novelette/novel. This suggestion of Ghumman drove Mir Tanha Yousufi to produce his first Punjabi novel
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Treh">Treh</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Treh">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>“Treh {Thirst}" in 1998. Fluently written, clear in thoughts, rushing story lines and the purity of the language made this book a surprise for the Punjabi readers.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ik_Samadar_Paar">Ik Samadar Paar</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Ik Samadar Paar">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Seeing the response on "Treh", Mir Tanha Yousufi was asked for more. Thus his second novel "Ik Samandar Paar [Across One Sea]", published in 2000, won the prestigious Punjabi literary award from "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust".
</p><p>“Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" is regarded as the most respectable of all awards in Punjabi. It is well known in Pakistani Punjabi writers' community what "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" actually means. Some writers spent their life span to win it just for once!
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Khiddoo">Khiddoo</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Khiddoo">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Taking further courage, he penned down his next novel "Khiddoo [The Cotton Ball]"; which won the award from "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust" for the second time, in the year 2002.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kaalaa_Chaanan">Kaalaa Chaanan</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Mir_Tanha_Yousafi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Kaalaa Chaanan">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>During all these years of writing "Treh", "Ik Samandar Paar" and "Khiddoo", along with his continuous activities in other Urdu and Punjabi writings (both poetry and prose), he had been thinking to write down something real big, a saga in Punjabi language. A deep research work, knowledge of the history and geography of the backdrop locale of the novel, the study of the civilisation, culture and anthropology of area was needed. And thus, was written his Pakistan's "National Literary Award, 2005" or "Syed Waris Shah Award, 2005" winner Punjabi novel "Kaalaa Chaanan [Black Light]"; which spans over 728 pages and is the thickest novel in Punjabi published in Pakistan till 2005.
When "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" for 2005 was made public; "Kaalaa Chaanan" was declared a winner and by this achievement Mir Tanha Yousufi became a writer who had won "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" three times in a row—a hat trick—a unique honour for any Pakistani Punjabi writer.
</p>

<p>To cater the demand of Punjabi loving people, the short stories written after "Sooraj Uggan Taen" were collected. These stories had been published in various Punjabi magazines and kept making waves all these years due to style, language and intellect. The book was named "Tae Faer [Then What?]"and was published in 2005.
</p><p>This book picked up "Pakistan Writers' Guild Punjab's Best Prose Book in Punjabi printed in 2005.
The same book was judged for "Razia Farrukh Kahani Award, 2005" and was announced the Best Short Stories' Book of the year.
