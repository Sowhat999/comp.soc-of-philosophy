</p><p>After the release of <i>The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars</i>, revised editions of the text and other similar works were published.

<p>The concept of filial piety has played a strong role in Chinese culture since ancient times. There was also a tradition of <a href="/wiki/Filial_mourning_(China)" title="Filial mourning (China)" class="mw-redirect">filial mourning</a>, in which a person had to temporarily put aside whatever he/she was doing when his/her parent(s) died and mourn for three years. There were sayings such as "When a ruler wants a subject to die, the subject must die; when a father wants a son to die, the son must die", and "A loyal subject should be sought from a family with filial sons."<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>However, in contemporary times, some stories in <i>The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars</i> are regarded as negative examples. These stories include the extreme example of Guo Ju deciding to kill his son so that he could free up his son's share of the family's food consumption to feed his mother. The negative examples also include stories in which the protagonist harms himself in the process of fulfilling filial piety, such as Wu Meng allowing mosquitoes to suck his blood in the hope that they would not bother his parents, and <a href="/wiki/Wang_Xiang" title="Wang Xiang">Wang Xiang</a> lying naked on ice to thaw the ice so that he could catch fish for his mother.
</p><p>There are some stories which are heavily criticised and even deemed contrary to Confucian principles. One example is the story of Cai Shun being rewarded by the <a href="/wiki/Chimei" title="Chimei" class="mw-redirect">Chimei</a> rebels for his filial piety. The story paints the rebels in a positive light when they actually violated the <a href="/wiki/Confucianism#Loyalty" title="Confucianism">Confucian virtue of loyalty to one's country</a>. Another example is the story of Laolaizi behaving in a childish manner to amuse his parents. The modern writer <a href="/wiki/Lu_Xun" title="Lu Xun">Lu Xun</a> said that Laolaizi's story is "an insult to the ancients, and a bad influence on future generations".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>

During winter, his stepmother prepared a coat made of reed catkins for him, but prepared coats made of cotton for his stepbrothers. One day, Min followed his father out and was instructed to drive the carriage. However, as the coat was too thin, Min was unable to withstand the cold so he shivered and was unable to focus on the task at hand. He accidentally caused the carriage to get stuck in a ditch. Min's father was furious and started beating him until his clothes tore and the reed catkins came out. It was then when Min's father realised that his son was being mistreated. He was so angry that he wanted to expel Min's stepmother from the family. However, Min pleaded with his father to spare his stepmother, saying, "If she stays, only I suffer. But if you send her away, my stepbrothers and I will suffer." Min's stepmother was so touched that she regretted her actions and never mistreated Min again.

When Jiang's mother said she preferred more company, the couple invited their neighbours to join them during meals. One day, due to bad weather, Jiang's wife did not return in time from her trip to the river. Jiang thought that she was being disrespectful to his mother by keeping her waiting, so he drove his wife away in anger. Jiang's wife stayed in a neighbour's house and spent the night weaving clothes for her mother-in-law, and asked the neighbours to help her deliver them the next day. When Jiang's mother learnt the truth, she ordered her son to bring her daughter-in-law home. On the day Jiang's wife came back, a fountain suddenly burst out in front of the house and the water from it tasted exactly like the water from the river. Besides, two carps also leapt out of the fountain every day. From then on, Jiang and his wife no longer needed to travel to the river to collect water and catch fish.

Wang travelled to the frozen river, undressed, and laid on the icy surface. The ice thawed and Wang was able to catch two carps for his stepmother.

When he reached home, he learnt that his father was seriously ill for two days. The physician told him that the way to check his father's condition was to taste his faeces. If they tasted bitter, it meant that his father was fine. Yu then tasted his father's faeces and found that they tasted sweet, so he became very worried. At night, he prayed to the gods and expressed his willingness to die in his father's place. However, his father still died a few days later. Yu buried his father and mourned for three years.
