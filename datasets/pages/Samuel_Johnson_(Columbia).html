<p>Johnson was born in <a href="/wiki/Guilford,_Connecticut" title="Guilford, Connecticut">Guilford, Connecticut</a>, the son of a <a href="/wiki/Fulling_mill" title="Fulling mill" class="mw-redirect">fulling miller</a>, Samuel Johnson Sr., and great-grandson of Robert Johnson, a founder of <a href="/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven Colony, Connecticut</a>.  But it was his grandfather William Johnson, a state assemblyman, village clerk, grammar school teacher, mapmaker, militia leader, judge, and church <a href="/wiki/Deacon" title="Deacon">deacon</a> who most influenced him.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> His grandfather taught him English at age four, and Hebrew at five; he would take young Samuel Johnson around the town on visits to his friends, and proudly have the young boy recite great passages of memorized scripture.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After tutoring with local ministers and schoolmasters in <a href="/wiki/Clinton,_Connecticut" title="Clinton, Connecticut">Clinton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Middletown,_Connecticut" title="Middletown, Connecticut">Middleton</a>, Johnson left Guilford at age 13 to attend the Collegiate School at Saybrook (now <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>) in 1710.  There he studied the theology of <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Wolleb" title="Johannes Wolleb">Johannes Wolleb</a> (Wollebius) and <a href="/wiki/William_Ames" title="William Ames">William Ames</a>. He graduated in 1714 with a bachelor's degree, and in 1717 was awarded a master's degree.  He began teaching grammar school in Guilford in 1713, even while a student a Yale.  He would continue to teach children and adults all this life, spending nearly 60 years as a teacher. In 1714, he began to write a short work titled <i>Synopsis Philosophiae Naturalis </i>summing up what the Puritan Mind knew of natural philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Leaving this attempt incomplete, he began working instead for his master's thesis on writing in Latin a more ambitious "encyclopedia of all knowledge", titled <i>Technologia Sive Technometria or Ars Encyclopaidia, Manualis Ceu Philosophia; Systema Liber Artis.</i><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> It was a systematic exploration of all knowledge available to Johnson based on the methods of the <a href="/wiki/Reformation" title="Reformation" class="mw-redirect">Reformation</a> logician <a href="/wiki/Petrus_Ramus" title="Petrus Ramus">Petrus Ramus</a>. His work on this logical exploration of the Puritan New England Mind would eventually result in 1271 hierarchically arranged thesis.

<p>In 1716, Johnson was appointed the senior tutor at Yale. Founded in 1701, Yale was located on a small neck of land in <a href="/wiki/Saybrook,_Connecticut" title="Saybrook, Connecticut" class="mw-redirect">Saybrook, Connecticut</a>. By 1716, Saybrook Point was considered too small to handle the needs of the growing school. Connecticut Governor <a href="/wiki/Gurdon_Saltonstall" title="Gurdon Saltonstall">Gurdon Saltonstall</a> and seven Yale trustees proposed moving the college to <a href="/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>.  They were opposed by three trustees, two of whom split the college, and opened a schismatic branch in <a href="/wiki/Wethersfield,_Connecticut" title="Wethersfield, Connecticut">Wethersfield, Connecticut</a>, taking half the students and the junior Yale tutor with them.
</p><p>For over two years Tutor Johnson was the sole member of the Yale faculty or administrator on-site in New Haven. Unsupervised, he took the opportunity to introduce the Enlightenment into Yale.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> When Johnson's close friend Daniel Brown left his position as Rector of <a href="/wiki/Hopkins_School" title="Hopkins School">Hopkin's Grammar School</a> and was formally hired as a second tutor in 1718,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Johnson found time to create the first catalog of books of Yale's expanded library, and, between 1717 and 1719, to write up  <i>Historical Remarks Concerning the Collegiate School</i>, the first history of Yale.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>  Johnson's first publication was a broadside printed for the 1718 Yale Commencement,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> which contained Latin commencement thesis.

</p><p>The next year was one of tumult.  In November 1718, Govern Saltonstall forced the schismatic Wethersfield students, including a young <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="Jonathan Edwards (theologian)">Jonathan Edwards</a>, to come to New Haven. The students were surly and rebellious. Johnson attempted to teach them his Enlightenment curriculum, and the students complained that he was a poor teacher. They returned to Wethersfield in January, 1719.  After the spring 1719 elections confirmed Saltonstall as Governor, the schematic trustees and students gave up and returned to New Haven. However, according to historian <a href="/wiki/Joseph_John_Ellis" title="Joseph John Ellis" class="mw-redirect">Joseph Ellis</a>,  "Johnson's presence precluded its reunification"<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  so he was "sacrificed for college unity"<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> and lost his job as tutor. Out of a job, he designed a new curriculum for a Yale now run by his friend Rector <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Cutler" title="Timothy Cutler">Timothy Cutler</a> and Tutor Daniel Brown, studied religion and philosophy, and wrote up a book on <i>Logic </i>(1720), which may have been used as class notes at Yale, but was not published in his lifetime.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1720, Johnson became <a href="/wiki/Congregational_church" title="Congregational church">Congregationalist</a> minister of a church in <a href="/wiki/West_Haven,_Connecticut" title="West Haven, Connecticut">West Haven</a>, Connecticut. Even though "he had much better offers", he took up the position for the sake "of being near the college and library".<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> There he, Yale Rector <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Cutler" title="Timothy Cutler">Timothy Cutler</a>, Yale Tutor Daniel Brown, and six other Connecticut ministers, including Rev. <a href="/wiki/Jared_Eliot" title="Jared Eliot">Jared Eliot</a> of Clinton, and Johnson's friend Rev. James Wetmore of North Haven, formed a group to study the Anglican divines and the "doctrines and facts of the <a href="/wiki/Primitive_church" title="Primitive church" class="mw-redirect">primitive church</a>". Their reading and discussions led them to question the validity of their ordinations, and the book group members converted from embracing a <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_polity" title="Presbyterian polity">Presbyterian polity</a> on <a href="/wiki/Ordination" title="Ordination">ordination</a> to an <a href="/wiki/Episcopal_consecration" title="Episcopal consecration" class="mw-redirect">Episcopal</a> one sometime in 1722. At Yale’s September 13, 1722 commencement, in a very public and dramatic event labeled the “Great Apostasy”<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> by American religion historian Sidney Ahlstrom, the nine member group declared for the <a href="/wiki/Episcopacy" title="Episcopacy" class="mw-redirect">episcopacy</a>.  After strong pressure from the Governor and their family and friends, five of the nine recanted, but Jonson, Cutler, Brown and Wetmore, refused to change their decision, and were expelled from their positions at Yale and their Congregational ministries.
</p><p>Johnson along with the others left the colony in order to seek ordination in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. As one of the now famous "Great Apostates" he was greeted warmly by the Church and University establishment.

In 1725, Johnson, the son of a fulling miller, married the widow Charity Floyd Nicoll, the mother of three young children, one of whom, William Nicoll, was heir to the vast estate of Islip Grange, in <a href="/wiki/Sayville,_New_York" title="Sayville, New York">Sayville, New York</a>, then part of a 100 square mile estate on <a href="/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> owned by the <a href="/wiki/Matthias_Nicoll" title="Matthias Nicoll">Matthias Nicoll family</a>.

</p><p>Charged with spreading the Anglican church in the colony, he formed parishes and opened <a href="/wiki/House_churches" title="House churches" class="mw-redirect">house churches</a> throughout the colony, which he then staffed with his disciples, who then built churches in the town.

</p><p>The debate was not only theological, but political and legal.

<p>Johnson was a seminal figure of <a href="/wiki/American_philosophy" title="American philosophy">American philosophy</a>. Though busy with ministry and educational duties, and raising his family, he never stopped learning or writing, and kept to his self-appointed mission to write up the sum of all knowledge. In February 1729, Johnson noted in his <i>Autobiography</i>, "came that very extraordinary genius <a href="/wiki/Bishop_Berkeley" title="Bishop Berkeley" class="mw-redirect">Bishop Berkeley</a>, then Dean of <a href="/wiki/Derry" title="Derry">Derry</a>, into America, and resided two years and a half at Rhode Island".  Johnson hurried to visit him, and his group in <a href="/wiki/Rhode_Island" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a>, including the painter <a href="/wiki/John_Smybert" title="John Smybert">John Smybert</a>. He became for a time a disciple of Berkeley's, and exchanged many letters with the philosopher over the years,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> discussing Berkeley's <a href="/wiki/Idealism" title="Idealism">idealist</a> philosophy. Before Berkeley left America in September 1731, Johnson convinced Berkeley to donate to Yale a large number of books, 500 pounds sterling, and a 100-acre farm with 100 pound sterling yearly income which would fund three scholars at the college.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Johnson published the essay "An Introduction to the Study of Philosophy, exhibiting a General view of all the Arts and Sciences” in the May 1731 issue of London-based periodical <i>The Present State of the Republick of Letters</i> (1728–36). Written just as he was about to send his two Nicoll stepsons to Yale, it was a manual for teaching young men <a href="/wiki/Ethics_in_religion" title="Ethics in religion">ethics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moral_philosophy" title="Moral philosophy" class="mw-redirect">moral philosophy</a>, things not taught at a Yale that had reverted to the Puritan curriculum after the Great Apostasy; it was the first work published by an American in a British journal.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1740s, while Johnson's son William Samuel Johnson was attending Yale, Johnson collaborated with Rector <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Clap" title="Thomas Clap">Thomas Clap</a> to create a new curriculum, for which he revised his moral philosophy and his tables on the sum of all knowledge. He published it as a textbook titled <i>An Introduction to the Study of Philosophy (1743)</i>. It was three times longer than his previous essay. In large bold letters on the front page facing the title page, he proclaimed it "A New System of Morality".<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> The work "was intended from the beginning to accompany President Clap of Yale’s 1743 <i>Library Catalogue of the Library of the Yale–College in New Haven</i>."<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

In its opening paragraph, reflecting the influence of <a href="/wiki/William_Wollaston" title="William Wollaston">William Wollaston</a> as well as Berkeley,  he defines philosophy as "The Pursuit of true Happiness in the Knowledge of things as being what they really are, and in acting or practicing according to that Knowledge."<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Going beyond Wollaston and Berkeley, "Johnson extended these men’s constructions with his own unique practice-oriented ideas of perception leading to action, and a freewill model of humans with a value system focused on pursuing happiness."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>Also in 1743, for his successful missionary work and his defense of the Anglican church in America he received an honorary <a href="/wiki/Doctorate_of_Divinity" title="Doctorate of Divinity" class="mw-redirect">doctorate of divinity</a> from Oxford.

</p><p>Dr. Johnson revised his moral philosophy textbook again, titling it <i>Ethices Elementa: or the First Principles of Moral Philosophy</i>. According to educator <a href="/wiki/Henry_Barnard" title="Henry Barnard">Henry Barnard</a>, “This work had a high reputation at the time of its publication, and met with an extensive sales.”<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> He revised it again with editions released in 1752 in Philadelphia and 1754 in London.

<p>Johnson had been considering a college in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> since 1749.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> In 1750, Johnson began to exchange a series of letters with Benjamin Franklin over the founding of a "new-model" or "English" college. Franklin admired Johnson's moral philosophy, and asked him to head up a proposed <a href="/wiki/The_Academy_and_College_of_Philadelphia" title="The Academy and College of Philadelphia">College of Philadelphia.</a><sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> Johnson declined the offer, and instead worked with his wife's relations, step-sons, former students, and the Rector and vestrymen of the Anglican <a href="/wiki/Trinity_Church,_New_York" title="Trinity Church, New York" class="mw-redirect">Trinity Church</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> to found a college there.
</p><p>In 1751 a board of trustees had been appointed by the New York State assembly to manage money raised in a lottery for a college in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>.  In 1752, Johnson was proposed as the logical choice for its President.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>  They proposed naming it King's College (it is now <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>), to help them secure an official <a href="/wiki/Royal_charter" title="Royal charter">royal charter</a> from <a href="/wiki/King_George_III" title="King George III" class="mw-redirect">King George II</a>. Johnson had recently met William Smith, a young Scot immigrant tutor, at the New York City Salon of Mrs. De Lancey, wife of Lt. Governor <a href="/wiki/James_De_Lancey" title="James De Lancey">James De Lancey</a>.  Johnson had suggested and mentored Smith's writing of a Utopian book of college education, titled  <i>A General Idea of the College of Mirania </i>(1753).<i> </i>Johnson recommenced the young William Smith to Franklin.
</p><p>In Colonial times, “The chair of moral philosophy stood above all other faculty positions in importance and prestige."<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup>  Selecting a moral philosophy was thus a fundamentally important consideration when founding a college. In 1752, at Franklin's urging, Johnson revised his philosophy textbook again to create a philosophy suitable for the proposed new-model colleges. Franklin took the unusual step (for him) of self-funding the domestic printing of <i>Elementa Philosophica</i> (1752).
</p><p>Between 1750 and 1753, Dr. Samuel Johnson, along with <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" title="Benjamin Franklin">Dr. Benjamin Franklin</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Smith_(Episcopalian_priest)" title="William Smith (Episcopalian priest)">Dr. William Smith</a>, created what <a href="/wiki/James_Madison_(bishop)" title="James Madison (bishop)">President James Madison</a> of the <a href="/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary" title="College of William and Mary" class="mw-redirect">College of William and Mary</a> called a "new-model"<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> plan or style of American College. They decided it would be profession-oriented, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> They also replaced the study of theology with non-denominational moral philosophy, using Johnson's "new system of morality" and his philosophy textbook as the core of the curriculum.
</p><p>Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford in June of 1753. William Smith immediately after the meeting left for London to raise funds and receive Anglican orders. Franklin and the board of trustees would appoint him Provost of the College of Philadelphia when he returned. Johnson with the help of his step-son Benjamin Nicoll, his former students, who were now powerful merchants, the De Launcey-Nicoll "Popular" downstate majority party in the New York Assembly, and the clergy and vestry of <a href="/wiki/Trinity_Church_(Manhattan)" title="Trinity Church (Manhattan)">Trinity Church, New York City</a>, created a board of Governors for the new college, ensuring that it had an <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> majority though it included <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church" title="Dutch Reformed Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a> and <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_(U.S.A.)" title="Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)" class="mw-redirect">Presbyterian Church</a> members. The assembly voted that a lottery be established to raise funds for the new college.
</p><p>The funding was bitterly opposed in print by board member <a href="/wiki/William_Livingston" title="William Livingston">William Livingston</a> and other Presbyterian politicians along with their Provincial upstate party allies in an intense two year newspaper war. Without funding and without an official charter, Johnson defiantly opened <a href="/wiki/Columbia_College,_Columbia_University" title="Columbia College, Columbia University">King's College</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>) in July of 1754. On October 31, it finally received the <a href="/wiki/Royal_charter" title="Royal charter">Royal charter</a>. It's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cHo4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">charter</a> promoted a college without a religious test for admission, was practice and profession oriented, public spirited, inclusive and diverse, and taught the then new disciplines of English literature and moral philosophy. It was <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic_Institute_of_New_York_University" title="Polytechnic Institute of New York University" class="mw-redirect">polytechnic</a> in scope, teaching math, science, history, commerce, government, and nature. Colonial Historian Richard Gummere noted that, "Had Johnson himself offered a specific course for each of these fields, he would have been presiding, <i>mutatis muntandis,</i> over the equivalent of a twentieth-century university."<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>  But Johnson also presented a values-focused curriculum, proposing in the <i>Advertisement </i>in May of 1754, to teach student to be “Ornaments to their Country and useful to the public Weal in their Generations” and "to lead them from the study of nature to knowledge of themselves, and of the God of nature and their duty to him, themselves, and one another, and everything that can contribute to their true happiness, both here and hereafter."<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup>  Once again, the pursuit of happiness was the focus of Johnson's curriculum, his table of philosophy, and his textbook.
</p><p>In addition to the burden of dealing with the political Presbyterians attacking his college as a devious Anglican plot, and hence leading Presbyterian parents to refuse to send their sons to it, and the usual ramp-up problems of starting a new college, the nine-year-long <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a> coincided almost exactly with Johnson's tenure at King's College, drying up funds and draining the pool of potential students while raising fears of invasion. He also had to deal with periodic outbreaks of smallpox, during which he had to leave the college to be run by his tutors for months at a time. Yet he persevered. In the twenty-two year period from 1758 to 1776 when the college closed due to the <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_War" title="Revolutionary War" class="mw-redirect">Revolutionary War</a>, 226 men attended, and 113 graduated.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>  Among the 79 college students who attended King's College during Johnson's <span class="frac nowrap">8<span class="visualhide">&#160;</span><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>-year tenure were some prominent future <a href="/wiki/Loyalists_(American_Revolution)" title="Loyalists (American Revolution)" class="mw-redirect">Loyalists</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Philipse" title="Adolph Philipse" class="mw-redirect">Adolph Philipse</a>, Daniel Robart, <a href="/wiki/Abraham_de_Peyster" title="Abraham de Peyster">Abraham De Peyster</a>, and <a href="/wiki/John_Vardill" title="John Vardill">John Vardill</a>.

</p><p>But even as his college rose, his life took a downward trend. He turned 60 in 1756. That year he lost his first grandson. That same year his beloved son William "Billy" died of smallpox on his ordination trip to England. His wife Charity died of smallpox in 1758. His step-daughter Anna and his student and wife's nephew Gilbert Floyd died in 1759. His stepson Benjamin Nicol, his best tutor Daniel Treadwell, and his fellow Great Apostate Rev. Wetmore died in 1760. On June 18, 1761 he married Sarah Beach, the widow of his old friend William Beach, and his son’s mother-in-law, and for a brief time he was "very happy".<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> In 1762, Johnson and the board of Governors hired the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University" class="mw-redirect">Oxford</a>-trained minister <a href="/wiki/Myles_Cooper" title="Myles Cooper">Myles Cooper</a>, a young man recommended by the Archbishop of Canterbury, as professor of moral philosophy with the expectation that Cooper would someday succeed him.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> Johnson quickly bonded with Cooper, who "was with him as a son".<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>  However, on February 9, 1763, Johnson lost his second wife Sarah to smallpox, and a few weeks after, amidst an unpleasant controversy with the Board of Governors over funding his pension, "he committed the care of his affairs to Mr. Cooper",<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> and returned to Stratford by sleigh during a snowstorm.

This time Johnson wrote not a textbook but a <a href="/wiki/Dialogue" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a> titled <i>Raphael, or The Genius of the English America </i>(c. 1764-5), which Johnson called "a Rhapsody". It begins with the arrival of "guardian or genius of New England" of a "beautiful countenance" who tells <i>Arisctocles </i>(who represents Johnson) to "call me <i><a href="/wiki/Raphael_(archangel)" title="Raphael (archangel)">Raphael</a></i>".

<p>Johnson has not garnered anywhere near the attention of his student and great rival, the Puritan theologian <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="Jonathan Edwards (theologian)">Johnathan Edwards</a>; he received, for example, only 2 pages compared to 16 on Jonathan Edwards in Sydney Ahlstrom's classic work <i>A Religious History of the American People.</i><sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> But he has been admired for his missionary work, his educational ideas, and his philosophy.

<p>Johnson was among the few colonial Americans whose cultural and intellectual achievements garnered notice in Great Britain. He was a friend of both Bishop George Berkeley and his son, the Rev. George Berkeley, Jr. The author of the English Dictionary, Dr. Samuel Johnson of London was a warm friend of his son William Samuel<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> and "knew of" the other transatlantic Dr. Johnson.<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> The American Dr. Johnson corresponded regularly with English Archbishops and Bishops, Colonial Governors, college heads in England and America, and the Secretaries of the <i>Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>His influence in the British American Colonies was even greater. He was well known at Yale, where he tutored, co-administered the Berkeley scholarship program from its inception in the 1730s, and partnered with President Clap to create an Enlightenment curriculum and reform the college in the 1740s. He created the Anglican church in Connecticut, beginning with one he built in 1724; by the time of his death in 1772, there were 43 churches in the colony.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> His Anglican disciples had spread out through all thirteen colonies and Canada by 1776. Johnson noted in a 1752 letter to Benjamin Franklin that he had “the great Satisfaction to see some of them in the first pulpits not only in Connecticut but also in Boston and York and others in some of the first places in the Land.”<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Johnson "new-model" college reforms also spread quickly. Rhode Island College (now Brown University) opened in 1764 as a non-denominational college in the "new-model" style not far from where Johnson took philosophical walks with Berkeley. In 1774, members of the board of trustees of the College of William and Mary, including Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Jefferson, Peyton Randolph, George Wythe, and Thomas Nelson, Jr., men who would soon pass <i>Lee's Resolution</i> and the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>, proposed to reform the college on the "new-model" plan of Johnson, Franklin and Smith, which they finally accomplished in 1777.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> During the Revolutionary war, Johnson's protegee Provost Dr. William Smith would found two more colleges in Maryland, <a href="/wiki/Washington_College" title="Washington College">Washington College</a> on the east shore, and <a href="/wiki/St._John%27s_College_(Annapolis/Santa_Fe)" title="St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)">St. James College</a> on its west shore.
</p><p>While Johnson's moral philosophy had been taught at Yale since the early 1740s, his most influential textbook on philosophy was his 1752 <i>Elementa Philosophica. </i>This was a revision and major expansion of his 1731, 1743, and 1746 textbooks on moral philosophy to include metaphysics and science, made at the request of Benjamin Franklin. In 1752, Franklin printed a fine if expensive first edition in Philadelphia, while a lower cost second edition printed in London in 1754 appeared with Johnson's corrections and an introduction by <a href="/wiki/Dr._William_Smith" title="Dr. William Smith" class="mw-redirect">Dr. William Smith</a>, provost of the College of Philadelphia. It has been estimated that about half the students in American Colleges between 1743 and 1776 were taught Johnson's moral philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup> According to Colonial College Historian, J. David Hoeveler, "In the middle eighteenth century, the collegians who studied" the ideas of the new-model colleges "created new documents of American nationhood".<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup> Three members of the <a href="/wiki/Committee_of_Five" title="Committee of Five">Committee of Five</a> who edited the <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" title="United States Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a></i> were connected to Johnson: his educational partner, promoter, and publisher <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, his student <a href="/wiki/Robert_R._Livingston_(chancellor)" title="Robert R.

Indeed, it has been estimated that 54% of the contributors to <i>Declaration of Independence </i>between September 5, 1775 and July 4, 1776, and 50% of the men who debated and passed it between June 28 and July 4, 1775, were connected to Johnson or his moral philosophy, making it the dominant morality at the Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Johnson taught many students in his 59 yearlong career as a teacher in Connecticut and New York.  His most important pupil was one of the founders of the American Republic: Johnson was the father of Dr. <a href="/wiki/William_Samuel_Johnson" title="William Samuel Johnson">William Samuel Johnson</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Founding_Father_of_the_United_States" title="Founding Father of the United States" class="mw-redirect">Founding Father of the United States</a>, who attended the <a href="/wiki/Stamp_Act_Congress" title="Stamp Act Congress">Stamp Act Congress</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Congress" title="Continental Congress">Continental Congress</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)" title="Constitutional Convention (United States)">United States Federal Constitutional Convention</a>, and was the first <a href="/wiki/U.S._Senator" title="U.S. Senator" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Senator</a> from Connecticut at the <a href="/wiki/1st_United_States_Congress" title="1st United States Congress">1st United States Congress</a>; he was "the only man who attended all four united congresses"<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup> that founded America.

<p>Johnson's missionary efforts in Connecticut have thrived and expanded. Christ Church, Stratford, remains an active and successful parish. A third church building was built in 1858 in the <a href="/wiki/Carpenter_Gothic" title="Carpenter Gothic">Carpenter Gothic Style</a> to replace Johnson's 1743 building; but the bell and the golden "brass" rooster weather vane that Johnson donated to the second 1743 church were installed in its steeple, and still call people to worship today. Out of this one church, Johnson founded 24 other churches in Connecticut colony himself, and he lived to see 43 total founded in the state, with 18 more founded by his disciples before his death in 1772. Today, there are more than 170 Episcopalian parishes in the state serving a membership of nearly 60,000 people.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Johnson closed his Stratford Common School in 1752, but his name is memorialized in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://sajohnson.stratfordk12.org/">Stratford Academy's Johnson House</a>, the facility for grades three (3) through six (6).  Its motto is <i>Tantum eruditi sunt liberi, "</i>Only the educated are free".
</p><p>The college he founded, King's College, was renamed by the New York Assembly after the Revolutionary War, and is now Columbia University.  For over 260 years, "Columbia has been a leader in higher education in the nation and around the world."<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup>  In one ranking in 2008, it was tied with two others as the top ranked American University.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winner, Columbia President, and American Philosopher <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Murray_Butler" title="Nicholas Murray Butler">Nicholas Murray Butler</a> summed up Johnson's impact as an educator and philosopher: "Suffice it to say here that Samuel Johnson was, with all his obvious limitations, a very remarkable man.  No one but a remarkable man could have had his career, have rendered his public service, or have had his vision of what world-wide illumination might follow form the flickering little candle which he lighted in the vestry room of Trinity Church during the summer months of 1754.”<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">&#91;84&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1999, Johnson's <i>Sermon Concerning the Intellectual World</i>, was published in Michael Warner's <i> American Sermons: The Pilgrims to Martin Luther King, Jr.,</i> an anthology of just fifty-eight American sermons from Colonial times to the Civil Rights Movement.
</p><p>In 2006, the Columbia University Alumni Association created the <i>Samuel Johnson Award for Distinguished Achievement</i> in the realm of engineering or applied science.
</p><p>Johnson's moral philosophy did not long outlast the Revolution in college classrooms, as "Scottish realism became the academic prop of American higher education" all the way through "the middle of the eighteenth century".<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup> However, Johnson's moral philosophy, defined in his textbook <i>Elementa Philosophica </i>as "the Art of pursuing our highest Happiness by the universal practice of virtue",<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup> influenced the core documents of the American Republic, and hence his work is still active in the governing and culture of America as embodied in the phrase, <a href="/wiki/Life,_liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_happiness" title="Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" class="mw-redirect">"life, liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness"</a>. Dr. Samuel Johnson, along with Dr. Benjamin Franklin and Dr. William Smith, may be considered one of the “Founding Grandfathers” who "first created the idealistic moral philosophy of 'the pursuit of Happiness', and then taught it in American colleges to the generation of men who would become the Founding Fathers."<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup> Today, there is once again a great deal of intellectual activity on the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Happiness" title="Happiness">happiness</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">&#91;88&#93;</a></sup>
