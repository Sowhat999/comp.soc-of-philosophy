<p>Born in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hirashima_Village&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hirashima Village (page does not exist)">Hirashima Village</a>, <a href="/wiki/Owari_Province" title="Owari Province">Owari Province</a> to a wealthy scholar family who later gave up their status to become farmers, Hosoi spent the first nine years of his life there as a student in a local temple. On becoming the top student, he was sent to <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nagoya" title="Nagoya">Nagoya</a> at age 17 where he studied under <a href="/w/index.php?title=Nakanishi_Tanen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nakanishi Tanen (page does not exist)">Nakanishi Tanen</a>. It was during this time that Hosoi gained an education in the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_classics" title="Chinese classics">Chinese classics</a> and when he was a young adult, he began giving lectures to <a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a> and commoners. After being taught in <a href="/wiki/Nagoya" title="Nagoya">Nagoya</a>, Hosoi moved to <a href="/wiki/Nagasaki" title="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, where he would remain for three years until he was forced to return home to take care of his ailing mother. After doing so, Hosoi moved back to <a href="/wiki/Nagoya" title="Nagoya">Nagoya</a>, where he opened up a school, but after a short time he decided to close the school down so that he could relocate to <a href="/wiki/Edo" title="Edo">Edo</a> in an effort to reestablish relations with his former teacher.<sup id="cite_ref-East_1914_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-East_1914-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In 1780, Hosoi was able to secure a position as a teacher in <a href="/wiki/Owari_Province" title="Owari Province">Owari</a>, where he occupied areas of land to be used as places where he could give his lectures and educate the local people.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Hosoi's thought was a mixture of lessons from all the schools of <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> existent at the time.  His philosophy emphasized practicality, independence of thought, and bringing the teachings of <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> to the general population. He believed that the scholars of the other schools made the teachings too complicated and disliked any kind of speculative thought. The practical emphasis of his teachings, along his focus on the economic conditions of the common person won him many disciples, who gave him the name of Living Buddha. One of these disciples, <a href="/wiki/Uesugi_Yozan" title="Uesugi Yozan" class="mw-redirect">Uesugi Yozan</a>, would become famous as a model <a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a>, using Hosoi as an advisor during his reform programs.<sup id="cite_ref-East_1914_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-East_1914-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>According to Hosoi's <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, there is an internal sincere purity within everyone as well as in the natural world. This purity, which he called <i>makoto</i>, was the basis for all <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical action</a>. This purity is corrupted when a person enters into the world and lives their life on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. In order for harmony, peace, and understanding to come about among humanity, a person had to keep their makoto pure.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The concept of makoto originated within the Shinto tradition, and throughout his philosophical writings and lectures, Hosoi draws extensively from Shinto beliefs.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Hosoi's view of women is similar to most Confucianist of the era, and his views can be said to closely resemble the perspective found in a work entitled <i>Greater Learning For Women</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-Bary.2C_Carol_Gluck_2005_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bary.2C_Carol_Gluck_2005-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> which was written by <a href="/wiki/Kaibara_Ekken" title="Kaibara Ekken">Kaibara Ekken</a>, a famous Confucianist of the <a href="/wiki/Neo-Confucianism" title="Neo-Confucianism">Zhu Xi school</a>. According to Hosoi's view, when a woman is in her <a href="/wiki/Childhood" title="Childhood">childhood</a>, the parents should refrain from spoiling her in order to keep her 
from developing a love of luxury, as well as being unable to adjust to the hardships of the married life.<sup id="cite_ref-Bary.2C_Carol_Gluck_2005_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bary.2C_Carol_Gluck_2005-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> When the woman becomes an adult, she should become married and become a model of endurance, taking on abuse while caring for the <a href="/wiki/Mother-in-law" title="Mother-in-law" class="mw-redirect">mother-in-law</a> and family.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Politics" title="Politics">politics</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Yonezawa_Domain" title="Yonezawa Domain">Yonezawa Domain</a> were greatly influenced by Hosoi's teachings, particularly during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Uesugi_Yozan" title="Uesugi Yozan" class="mw-redirect">Uesugi Yozan</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a> who had been tutored by Hosoi since his youth.<sup id="cite_ref-James_Murdoch_1996_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James_Murdoch_1996-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Hosoi lectured Yozan &amp; other students on his conception of <a href="/wiki/Confucian" title="Confucian" class="mw-redirect">Confucian</a> politics, and what proper statescraft was. For Hosoi, the <a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a> was seen as a servant of Heaven, and that a faithful servant:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">does not forget for an instant that if despite his noble status, he does not reject luxury; if despite the wealth of his land; he does not reject lavishness, and if he does not serve as a parent of his people, he will have erred in his office of servant of Heaven and will have violated the filial piety that an heir owes his ancestors.<sup id="cite_ref-Mark_Ravina_1999_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mark_Ravina_1999-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</blockquote>
<p>The success of the <a href="/wiki/Yonezawa_Domain" title="Yonezawa Domain">Yonezawa Domain</a> in administration and economic reform was largely seen as a result of Hosoi's influence and Uesugi's dedication and diligence in following plans and ruling by the maxims of "To have no waste places in his domain" and "To have no idlers among his people." <sup id="cite_ref-James_Murdoch_1996_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James_Murdoch_1996-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> There was extensive land reclamation, agricultural training for all classes, and the development of a silk &amp; lacquer industry .<sup id="cite_ref-James_Murdoch_1996_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-James_Murdoch_1996-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> However, despite the success of the reforms, it is important to note that in Hosoi's <a href="/wiki/Political_philosophy" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>, loyal service is essential, and part of this loyal service is exalting one's superior. A ruler who was not infallible had to be protected by a virtuous person who was in his service. Hosoi believed that by concealing the ruler's mistakes and decadence, the people would not become corrupt and thus have a moral example that they could admire. As a result of this, Uesugi Yozan is traditionally revered throughout Japanese history as a ruler who was full of virtue and wise.<sup id="cite_ref-Mark_Ravina_1999_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mark_Ravina_1999-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>

<p>As an educator, Hosoi placed emphasis on the individuality of each student present, and disliked <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a> that involved teaching students collective thought. His beliefs in education can be seen in a letter he wrote to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lord_Of_Yonezawa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lord Of Yonezawa (page does not exist)">Lord Of Yonezawa</a>:
