<p>By 1905 Babajan arrived in Pune, where she established her final residence. Now an old woman, her back slightly bent, shoulders rounded, with white matted hair, and shabbily dressed, she "was seen sitting or resting at odd places, in different parts of the City."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Babajan finally located to a slum area called Char Bawdi (Four Wells) on Malcolm Tank Road, part of a British Army <a href="/wiki/Cantonment" title="Cantonment">cantonment</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Char Bawdi area at that time has been described as "a picture of dirt, desolation and ugliness, a breeding spot of plague and pestilence and a regular haunt of dangerous riff-raffs by night."<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> After several months’ exposure to the natural elements, Babajan grudgingly allowed her devotees to build a basic shelter of gunny sacks above her.

The gifts from her devotees were shared among the poor and destitute, and in some instances stolen from her by thieves.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> She remained indifferent to the material offerings or the loss. Gradually, out of devotion, or mere curiosity, increasing numbers of people from Pune and elsewhere sought her out. Several alleged <a href="/wiki/Miracle" title="Miracle">miracles</a> have been attributed to Babajan.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>According to one observer, within a decade of Babajan taking residence "the [Char Bawdi] locality underwent a metamorphosis surpassing all expectations. What with the featural changes in the buildings all around, electrified tea-shops ringing with the clatter of cups and saucers, a concourse of peoples consisting of all ranks and creeds waiting for Babajan’s <i><a href="/wiki/Dar%C5%9Bana" title="Darśana">darshana</a></i>, a street bard entertaining the crowd with his music, the beggars clamouring for alms, easy-going idlers standing indiscriminately hampering vehicular traffic and the whole atmosphere heavily laden with sweet burning incense perpetually kept burning near Babajan, presented a scene typically Eastern, leaving an indelible impression on one’s memory."<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

<p>In 1930, several months before Babajan died, then journalist <a href="/wiki/Paul_Brunton" title="Paul Brunton">Paul Brunton</a> visited her.

<p>There are a few discrepancies to be found in the current biographies of Hazrat Babajan which require due mention.
</p><p>Firstly, it should be noted that much of the accepted information about Babajan appears to have been established solely on the authority of Meher Baba, a fact acknowledged by Dr Abdul Ghani Munsiff, who in 1939 wrote the first life-sketch of Babajan. According to Ghani, "the information gleaned from different sources is meagre, since Babajan herself was never communicative to anyone with regard to her life history. The facts of her early life and those relating to her spiritual career have all been confirmed by Hazrat Meher Baba, her chief disciple and spiritual Chargeman (<i>Khalifa</i>)".<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Yet Meher Baba appears to have provided/endorsed two different versions of Babajan’s life.

<p>Over a decade before Dr Ghani’s life-sketch of Babajan appeared, in 1927 Meher Baba gave a public talk on Babajan, which a devotee had recorded in a diary at that time. This is currently the earliest account of Babajan’s life. The people being addressed were predominantly women, and the story was told to provide a moral. To summarize the essentials of that brief talk:
</p><p>Hazrat Babajan is the daughter of one of the then responsible and chief ministers of the Amir of Afghanistan at Kabul. From early childhood she had a natural inclination toward spirituality and the realization of Truth. When Babajan was fifteen years of age her guardians began to arrange for her marriage … at this juncture she made bold to leave the family home. For fifty years thereafter she led a life of complete resignation and renunciation. After wandering from place to place for fifty long years she at last came across her Master, and became God-Realized at the age of about sixty-five. After being God-Realized Babajan lived for some time … in the Punjab. During this stay many people began to respect her as a saint. Her occasional remarks, declaring herself to be God [<i>Ana'l-Haqq</i>, I am the Truth] upset the Muslim population, and fanatical Muslim Baluchi soldiers (<i>sepoys</i>) of a local military regiment buried Babajan alive. After a lapse of many years, during the First World War the Baluchi regiment was transferred to Pune, and in that city  the same soldiers came face-to-face with Babajan sitting under her neem tree at Char Bawdi. Fanaticism was transformed into devotion, and as long as the regiment remained stationed at Pune, the soldiers came to pay their respects to Babajan.
</p><p>Ghani’s later, and extended, version of Babajan’s life, published in 1939, provides a different account: She left home at the age of eighteen on her wedding day. Eventually came into contact with a Hindu <i>sadguru</i> at Rawalpindi. Later went down to the Punjab, and when she was thirty-seven met a Muslim saint in Multan who gave her God-Realization. After the Baluchi soldiers encountered her again in Pune, "her saintly fame spread far and wide, and she came to be universally known as Hazrat Babajan".<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

<p>Babajan’s alleged age when she died continues to be a controversial issue. Biography variants for her date of birth range from 1790 to <i>c</i>. 1820. The earliest birth dates are provided by Charles B Purdom and Bhau Kalchuri. Purdom was merely reporting the opinion of devotees, and so he qualified what he wrote: "her actual date of birth is not known; it is supposed to have been about 1790".<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Kalchuri is more dogmatic, and states Babajan was born "between 1790 and 1800",  and her "physical presence on earth lasted between 130 to 141 years". <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> At the other end of the scale, in his colourful spiritual travel book, <i>A Search in Secret India</i> (1934), the then freelance journalist, Paul Brunton, recounts that he learnt "from former Judge Khandalawalla, who had known [Hazrat Babajan] for fifty years, that her age is really about ninety-five".<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Brunton had arrived in India, November 1930, and had left several months before Babajan’s death in September 1931.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>
</p><p>Regarding Brunton’s report, Kevin R D Shepherd observed: "That Khandalawalla had known Babajan for as long as fifty years is questionable; though it need not be doubted that he had encountered her by the time of her second visit to Bombay <i>c</i>. 1900".<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Shepherd concluded, "The general computation of her age was about 120 years, though some maintained that it was in excess of this. Purdom cited an approximate date of 1790 for her birth, though Ghani was of the view that she was born later than this. Ghani’s estimate of her age was 125, based on general reminiscences and his own contact with her. In deference to critical tendencies which find the higher estimates indigestible, there seems every ground to believe that the subject was over a hundred by the time of her death".<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The fact is Babajan’s actual date of birth is not known, so perhaps it is sufficient to concede that the subject may well have been over a hundred by the time of her death. Longevity is not a spiritual accomplishment, but unfortunately can easily become a superficial <a href="/wiki/Hagiographic" title="Hagiographic" class="mw-redirect">hagiographic</a> embellishment.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

This intense spiritual experience does not appear to have been an ultimate achievement. According to Meher Baba, she "became God Realized at the age of about sixty-five" at the hands of another (unnamed) Master.

According to this school of thought, soul’s annihilation means the mystic’s obliteration from every kind of knowledge of his phenomenal existence and individual qualities. Subsistence of the soul denotes knowledge of eternal existence and the seeker’s abiding in God" (see Bhatnagar, R S: <i>Dimensions of Classical Sufi Thought</i>, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Pvt.
