311/310 bc epicurus taught mytilene caused strife forced leave
then founded school lampsacus before returning athens 306 bc remained until death
there founded garden κῆπος school named garden owned served school's meeting place halfway locations two other schools philosophy stoa academy
even though many teachings heavily influenced earlier thinkers especially democritus differed significant way democritus determinism
epicurus often deny influence denounce other philosophers confused claim self-taught
epicurus never married no known children
most likely vegetarian
suffered kidney stones finally succumbed 270 bc age seventy-two despite prolonged pain involved idomeneus written letter you happy day me also last day my life
attacked painful inability urinate also dysentery violent nothing added violence my sufferings
cheerfulness my mind comes recollection my philosophical contemplation counterbalances these afflictions
beg you take care children metrodorus manner worthy devotion shown young man me philosophy
school epicurus' school based garden house thus called garden small devoted following lifetime
primary members hermarchus financier idomeneus leonteus wife themista satirist colotes mathematician polyaenus lampsacus leontion metrodorus lampsacus most famous popularizer epicureanism
school first ancient greek philosophical schools admit women rule rather exception
inscription gate garden recorded seneca epistle xxi epistulae morales ad lucilium stranger here you will well tarry here our highest good pleasure
epicurus emphasized friendship important ingredient happiness school resembled many ways community friends living together
however also instituted hierarchical system levels among followers them swear oath core tenets
teachings main article epicureanism small bronze bust epicurus herculaneum
illustration baumeister 1885 prefiguring science ethics epicurus key figure development science scientific methodology because insistence nothing should believed except tested through direct observation logical deduction
key figure axial age period 800 bc 200 bc during according karl jaspers similar thinking appeared china india iran near east ancient greece
statement ethic reciprocity foundation ethics earliest ancient greece differs formulation utilitarianism jeremy bentham john stuart mill emphasizing minimization harm oneself others way maximize happiness
epicurus's teachings represented departure other major greek thinkers period before nevertheless founded many same principles democritus
like democritus atomist believing fundamental constituents world indivisible little bits matter atoms greek ἄτομος atomos indivisible flying through empty space greek κενόν kenon
everything occurs result atoms colliding rebounding becoming entangled another
theory differs earlier atomism democritus because admits atoms follow straight lines their direction motion may occasionally exhibit swerve greek παρέγκλισις parenklisis latin clinamen
allowed avoid determinism implicit earlier atomism affirm free will
regularly admitted women slaves school first greeks break god-fearing god-worshiping tradition common time even while affirming religious activities useful way contemplate gods use them example pleasant life
epicurus participated activities traditional greek religion taught should avoid holding false opinions gods
gods immortal blessed men ascribe any additional qualities alien immortality blessedness according epicurus impious
gods punish bad reward good common man believes
opinion crowd epicurus claims gods send great evils wicked great blessings righteous model themselves after gods whereas epicurus believes gods reality concern themselves human beings
man denies gods worshipped multitude impious affirms gods multitude believes them
pleasure absence suffering epicurus' philosophy based theory good bad derive sensations defined pleasure pain good pleasurable bad painful
ideas pleasure pain ultimately epicurus basis moral distinction good evil
pain chosen over pleasure cases because leads greater pleasure
although epicurus commonly misunderstood advocate rampant pursuit pleasure teachings striving absence pain suffering both physical mental state satiation tranquility free fear death retribution gods
epicurus argued suffer pain no longer need pleasure enter state ataraxia tranquility soul imperturbability
epicurus' teachings introduced medical philosophy practice epicurean doctor asclepiades bithynia first physician introduced greek medicine rome
asclepiades introduced friendly sympathetic pleasing painless treatment patients
advocated humane treatment mental disorders insane persons freed confinement treated them natural therapy such diet massages
teachings surprisingly modern therefore asclepiades considered pioneer physician psychotherapy physical therapy molecular medicine
epicurus explicitly warned against overindulgence because often leads pain
instance epicurus warned against pursuing love too ardently
defended friendships ramparts pleasure denied them any inherent worth
also believed contrary aristotle death feared
man dies does feel pain death because no longer therefore feels nothing
therefore epicurus famously death nothing us
exist death death exists
sensation consciousness ends death therefore death there neither pleasure nor pain
fear death arises belief death there awareness
doctrine arose epicurean epitaph non fui fui non sum non curo am care inscribed gravestones followers seen many ancient gravestones roman empire
quotation often used today humanist funerals
ethical guideline epicurus emphasized minimizing harm maximizing happiness oneself others impossible live pleasant life without living wisely well justly impossible live wisely well justly without living pleasantly
justly meaning prevent person harming being harmed another epicurean paradox epicurean paradox version problem evil
lactantius attributes trilemma epicurus de ira dei god says either wishes take away evils unable able unwilling neither willing nor able both willing able
willing unable feeble accordance character god able unwilling envious equally variance god neither willing nor able both envious feeble therefore god both willing able alone suitable god source then evils? why does remove them? dialogues concerning natural religion 1779 david hume also attributes argument epicurus epicurus’s old questions yet unanswered
willing prevent evil able? then impotent
able willing? then malevolent
both able willing? whence then evil? no extant writings epicurus contain argument possible misattributed
perhaps earliest expression trilemma appears writings sceptic sextus empiricus 160–210 ad outlines pyrrhonism further too should
anyone asserts god exists either says god takes care things cosmos does does take care either things
now takes care everything there no particular evil thing no evil general cosmos dogmatists say everything full evil therefore god shall take care everything
other hand takes care things why does take care these those? either wishes able able does wish neither wishes nor able
both wished able taken care everything reasons stated above does take care everything therefore case both wishes able take care everything
wishes able weaker cause account able take care things does take care contrary concept god should weaker anything
again able take care everything does wish will considered malevolent neither wishes nor able both malevolent weak say god impious
therefore god does take care things cosmos
epistemology epicurus emphasized senses epistemology principle multiple explanations several theories consistent observed data retain them early contribution philosophy science
there also things enough state single cause several however case
just you see lifeless corpse man lying far away fitting list causes death order make sure single cause death may stated
you able establish conclusively died sword cold illness perhaps poison know there something kind happened
politics contrast stoics epicureans showed little interest participating politics day since doing leads trouble
instead advocated seclusion
principle epitomized phrase lathe biōsas λάθε βιώσας meaning live obscurity get through life without drawing attention yourself
live without pursuing glory wealth power anonymously enjoying little things like food company friends etc
plutarch elaborated theme essay saying live obscurity right? εἰ καλῶς εἴρηται τὸ λάθε βιώσας recte dictum sit latenter esse vivendum 1128 c cf
flavius philostratus vita apollonii
epicureans innovative theory justice social contract
justice epicurus agreement neither harm nor harmed need such contract order enjoy fully benefits living together well-ordered society
laws punishments needed keep misguided fools line otherwise break contract
wise person sees usefulness justice because limited desires no need engage conduct prohibited laws any case
laws useful promoting happiness just those useful just
