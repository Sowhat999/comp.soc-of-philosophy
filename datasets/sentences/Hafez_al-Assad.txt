although jadid slow see assad's threat shortly after war assad began developing network military promoted friends close relatives high positions
differences jadid assad believed syria's defeat six-day war jadid's fault accusations against himself unjust
time jadid total control regional command whose members supported policies
assad jadid began differ policy assad believed jadid's policy people's war armed-guerrilla strategy class struggle failed syria undermining position
although jadid continued champion concept people's war even after six-day war assad opposed
felt palestinian guerrilla fighters given too much autonomy raided israel constantly turn sparked war
jadid broken diplomatic relations countries deemed reactionary such saudi arabia jordan
because syria receive aid other arab countries
egypt jordan participated war received £135 million per year undisclosed period
while jadid supporters prioritized socialism internal revolution assad wanted leadership focus foreign policy containment israel
ba'ath party divided over several issues such how government best use syria's limited resources ideal relationship party people organization party whether class struggle should end
these subjects discussed heatedly ba'ath party conclaves reached fourth regional congress two sides irreconcilable
assad wanted democratize party making easier people join
jadid wary too large membership believing majority those joined opportunists
assad interview patrick seale 1980 s stated such policy make party members believe privileged class
another problem assad believed lack local-government institutions
under jadid there no governmental level below council ministers syrian government
ba'athist iraqi regional branch continued support aflaqite leadership took control iraq 17 july revolution assad few high-level politicians wishing reconcile them called establishment eastern front iraq against israel 1968

shortly after failed attempt expel assad regional command began consolidate position military establishment—for example replacing chief staff ahmad al-suwaydani friend mustafa tlass

february 1969 assad-jadid conflict erupted violent clashes through their respective proteges rifaat al-assad assad's brother high-ranking military commander jundi
reason violence rifaat al-assad's suspicion jundi planning attempt assad's life

zu'ayyin heard news wept saying orphaned now referring jadid's loss their protector
despite fact assad drove jundi suicide also wept heard news
assad now control hesitated push advantage
jadid continued rule syria regional command unchanged
however assad influenced jadid moderate policies
class struggle muted criticism reactionary tendencies other arab states ceased political prisoners freed coalition government formed ba'ath party control eastern front—espoused assad—was formed iraq jordan

assad tlass stripped their government posts congress these acts little practical significance
national congress ended 12 november 1970 assad ordered loyalists arrest leading members jadid's government

first tried establish national unity felt lost under leadership aflaq jadid
assad differed predecessor outset visiting local villages hearing citizen complaints
syrian people felt assad's rise power lead change first acts ruler visit sultan pasha al-atrash father aflaqite ba'athist mansur al-atrash honor efforts during great arab revolution
made overtures writers' union rehabilitating those forced underground jailed sent exile representing radical ba'athists called reactionary classes am determined you shall no longer feel strangers your own country
although assad democratize country eased government's repressive policies
cut prices basic foodstuffs 15 percent won support ordinary citizens
jadid's security services purged military criminal investigative powers transferred police confiscation goods under jadid reversed
restrictions travel trade lebanon eased assad encouraged growth private sector
while assad supported most jadid's policies proved pragmatic after came power
most jadid's supporters faced choice continue working ba'ath government under assad face repression
assad made clear beginning there no second chances
however later 1970 recruited support ba'athist old guard supported aflaq's leadership during 1963–1966 power struggle
estimated 2000 former ba'athists rejoined party after hearing assad's appeal among them party ideologist georges saddiqni shakir al-fahham secretary founding st national congress ba'ath party 1947
assad ensured defect pro-aflaqite ba'ath party iraq treason trials 1971 prosecuted aflaq amin al-hafiz nearly 100 followers most absentia

assad turned presidency known simply head state under jadid position power during rule
many ways presidential authority replaced ba'ath party's failed experiment organized military leninism syria became hybrid leninism gaullist constitutionalism
according raymond hinnebusch president became main source initiative government personality values strengths weaknesses became decisive direction stability
arguably assad's leadership gave government enhanced combination consistency flexibility hitherto lacked
assad institutionalized system final say weakened powers collegial institutions state party
fidelity leader replaced ideological conviction later presidency corruption became widespread
state-sponsored cult personality became pervasive assad's authority strengthened colleagues' expense became sole symbol government
because assad wanted become arab leader considered himself successor nasser since rose power november 1970 few weeks after nasser's death
modeled presidential system nasser's hailed nasser pan-arabic leadership publicly displayed photographs nasser posters himself
pictures assad—often engaged heroic activities—were ubiquitous public places
named number locations institutions after himself family members
schools children taught songs praising assad
teachers began each lesson song our eternal leader hafez al-assad sometimes portrayed seemingly divine attributes
sculptures portraits depicted islamic prophet muhammad after mother's death government produced portraits her halo
syrian officials compelled call assad sanctified al-muqaddas
strategy also pursued son bashar al-assad
while assad rule alone increasingly last word those whom worked eventually became lieutenants rather colleagues
none political elite question decision those dismissed
general naji jamil example being dismissed after disagreed assad's handling islamic uprising
two highest decision-making bodies regional command national command both part ba'ath party
joint sessions these bodies resembled politburos socialist states espoused communism
assad headed national command regional command secretary general regional secretary respectively
regional command highest decision-making body syria appointing president through cabinet
presidential authority strengthened power regional command members evaporated
regional national commands nominally responsible regional congress national congress—with national congress de jure superior body—but regional congress de facto authority
national congress included delegates ba'athist regional branches other countries compared comintern
functioned session regional congress focusing syria's foreign policy party ideology
regional congress limited accountability until 1985 eighth regional congress last under assad
1985 responsibility leadership accountability transferred regional congress weaker national progressive front
sectarianism assad sunni members political elite l–r ahmad al-khatib assad abdullah al-ahmar mustafa tlass assad came power increased alawite dominance security intelligence sectors near-monopoly
coercive framework under control weakening state party
according hinnebusch alawite officers around assad pivotal because personal kinsmen clients president combined privileged access positions party control levers coercion
therefore unrivalled position act political brokers especially times crisis uniquely placed shape outcomes
leading figures alawite-dominated security system family connections rifaat al-assad controlled struggle companies assad's son-in-law adnan makhluf second-in-command commander presidential guard
other prominent figures ali haydar special-forces head ibrahim al-ali popular army head muhammad al-khuli head assad's intelligence-coordination committee military intelligence head ali duba
assad controlled military through alawites such generals shafiq fayyad commander 3 rd division ibrahim safi commander st division adnan badr hasan commander 9 th division
during 1990 s assad further strengthened alawite dominance replacing sunni general hikmat al-shihabi general ali aslan chief staff
alawites their high status appointed promoted based kinship favor rather professional respect
therefore alawite elite emerged these policies
assad's elite non-sectarian prominent sunni figures beginning rule abdul halim khaddam shihabi naji jamil abdullah al-ahmar mustafa tlass
however none these people distinct power base assad
although sunnis held positions air force commander 1971 1994 jamil subhi haddad ali malahafji general intelligence head 1970 2000 adnan dabbagh ali al-madani nazih zuhayr fuad al-absi bashir an-najjar chief staff syrian army 1974 1998 shihabi defense minister 1972 until after assad's death tlass none power separate assad alawite-dominated security system
jamil headed air force issue orders without knowledge khuli alawite head air force intelligence
after failed islamic uprising assad's reliance relatives intensified before sunni colleagues autonomy
defector assad's government tlass army same time seems army neither binds nor loosens no role other tail beast
another example shihabi occasionally represented assad
however no control syrian military ali aslan first deputy chief staff operations during most tenure responsible troop maneuvers
although sunnis forefront alawites power
islamist uprising main article islamist uprising syria background assad's pragmatic policies indirectly led establishment new class accepted while furthered aims against israel

channeling external money through state private enterprises created growing opportunities state elites' self-enrichment through corrupt manipulation state-market interchanges
besides outright embezzlement webs shared interests commissions kickbacks grew up high officials politicians business interests
alawite military-security establishment got greatest share money ba'ath party leaders ruled new class defending their interests instead those peasants workers whom supposed represent
coupled growing sunni disillusionment hinnebusch calls regime's mixture statism rural sectarian favouritism corruption new inequalities fueled growth islamic movement
because muslim brotherhood syria became vanguard anti-ba'athist forces
brotherhood historically vehicle moderate islam during introduction syrian political scene during 1960 s under leadership mustafa al-siba'i
after siba'i's imprisonment under isam al-attar's leadership brotherhood developed ideological antithesis ba'athist rule
however ba'ath party's organizational superiority worked favor attar's enforced exile muslim brotherhood disarray
