cantor's work great philosophical interest fact well aware
cantor's theory transfinite numbers originally regarded counter-intuitive even shocking encountered resistance mathematical contemporaries such leopold kronecker henri poincaré later hermann weyl l
brouwer while ludwig wittgenstein raised philosophical objections
cantor devout lutheran believed theory communicated god
christian theologians particularly neo-scholastics saw cantor's work challenge uniqueness absolute infinity nature god occasion equating theory transfinite numbers pantheism proposition cantor vigorously rejected
objections cantor's work occasionally fierce henri poincaré referred ideas grave disease infecting discipline mathematics leopold kronecker's public opposition personal attacks included describing cantor scientific charlatan renegade corrupter youth
kronecker objected cantor's proofs algebraic numbers countable transcendental numbers uncountable results now included standard mathematics curriculum
writing decades after cantor's death wittgenstein lamented mathematics ridden through through pernicious idioms set theory dismissed utter nonsense laughable wrong
cantor's recurring bouts depression 1884 end life blamed hostile attitude many contemporaries though explained these episodes probable manifestations bipolar disorder

cantor's father member saint petersburg stock exchange became ill family moved germany 1856 first wiesbaden then frankfurt seeking winters milder those saint petersburg
1860 cantor graduated distinction realschule darmstadt exceptional skills mathematics trigonometry particular noted
1862 cantor entered university zürich
after receiving substantial inheritance upon father's death 1863 cantor shifted studies university berlin attending lectures leopold kronecker karl weierstrass ernst kummer
spent summer 1866 university göttingen then later center mathematical research
teacher researcher cantor submitted dissertation number theory university berlin 1867
after teaching briefly berlin girls' school cantor took up position university halle spent entire career
awarded requisite habilitation thesis also number theory presented 1869 upon appointment halle
1874 cantor married vally guttmann
six children last rudolph born 1886
cantor able support family despite modest academic pay thanks inheritance father
during honeymoon harz mountains cantor spent much time mathematical discussions richard dedekind whom met two years earlier while swiss holiday
cantor promoted extraordinary professor 1872 made full professor 1879
attain latter rank age 34 notable accomplishment cantor desired chair prestigious university particular berlin time leading german university
however work encountered too much opposition possible
kronecker headed mathematics berlin until death 1891 became increasingly uncomfortable prospect having cantor colleague perceiving corrupter youth teaching ideas younger generation mathematicians
worse yet kronecker well-established figure within mathematical community cantor's former professor disagreed fundamentally thrust cantor's work
kronecker now seen founders constructive viewpoint mathematics disliked much cantor's set theory because asserted existence sets satisfying certain properties without giving specific examples sets whose members indeed satisfy those properties
cantor came believe kronecker's stance make impossible ever leave halle
1881 cantor's halle colleague eduard heine died creating vacant chair
halle accepted cantor's suggestion offered dedekind heinrich m
weber franz mertens order each declined chair after being offered
friedrich wangerin eventually appointed never close cantor
1882 mathematical correspondence cantor richard dedekind came end apparently result dedekind's declining chair halle
cantor also began another important correspondence gösta mittag-leffler sweden soon began publish mittag-leffler's journal acta mathematica
1885 mittag-leffler concerned philosophical nature new terminology paper cantor submitted acta
asked cantor withdraw paper acta while proof writing
hundred years too soon
cantor complied then curtailed relationship correspondence mittag-leffler writing third party mittag-leffler way should wait until year 1984 me seemed too great demand!
course never want know anything again acta mathematica
cantor suffered first known bout depression 1884
criticism work weighed mind every fifty-two letters mittag-leffler 1884 mentioned kronecker
passage these letters revealing damage cantor's self-confidence
don't know shall return continuation my scientific work
moment absolutely nothing limit myself most necessary duty my lectures how much happier scientifically active necessary mental freshness
crisis led apply lecture philosophy rather mathematics
also began intense study elizabethan literature thinking there might evidence francis bacon plays attributed shakespeare see shakespearean authorship question ultimately resulted two pamphlets published 1896 1897
cantor recovered soon thereafter subsequently made further important contributions including diagonal argument theorem
however never again attained high level remarkable papers 1874–84
eventually sought achieved reconciliation kronecker
nevertheless philosophical disagreements difficulties dividing them persisted
1890 cantor instrumental founding deutsche mathematiker-vereinigung chaired first meeting halle 1891 first introduced diagonal argument reputation strong enough despite kronecker's opposition work ensure elected first president society
setting aside animosity kronecker displayed towards cantor invited address meeting kronecker unable because wife dying injuries sustained skiing accident time
late years after cantor's 1884 hospitalization there no record any sanatorium again until 1899
soon after second hospitalization cantor's youngest son rudolph died suddenly while cantor delivering lecture views baconian theory william shakespeare tragedy drained cantor much passion mathematics
cantor again hospitalized 1903
year later outraged agitated paper presented julius könig third international congress mathematicians
paper attempted prove basic tenets transfinite set theory false
since paper read front daughters colleagues cantor perceived himself having publicly humiliated
although ernst zermelo demonstrated less day later könig's proof failed cantor remained shaken momentarily questioning god
cantor suffered chronic depression rest life excused teaching several occasions repeatedly confined various sanatoria
events 1904 preceded series hospitalizations intervals two three years
abandon mathematics completely however lecturing paradoxes set theory burali-forti paradox cantor's paradox russell's paradox meeting deutsche mathematiker–vereinigung 1903 attending international congress mathematicians heidelberg 1904

mathematical work cantor's work 1874 1884 origin set theory
prior work concept set rather elementary used implicitly since beginning mathematics dating back ideas aristotle
no realized set theory any nontrivial content
before cantor there finite sets easy understand infinite considered topic philosophical rather mathematical discussion
proving there infinitely many possible sizes infinite sets cantor established set theory trivial needed studied
set theory come play role foundational theory modern mathematics sense interprets propositions mathematical objects example numbers functions traditional areas mathematics such algebra analysis topology single theory provides standard set axioms prove disprove them
basic concepts set theory now used throughout mathematics
earliest papers cantor proved set real numbers numerous set natural numbers showed first time there exist infinite sets different sizes
also first appreciate importance one-to-one correspondences hereinafter denoted 1-to-1 correspondence set theory
used concept define finite infinite sets subdividing latter denumerable countably infinite sets uncountable sets nondenumerable infinite sets
cantor developed important concepts topology their relation cardinality
example showed cantor set nowhere dense same cardinality set real numbers whereas rationals everywhere dense countable
cantor introduced fundamental constructions set theory such power set set set possible subsets
later proved size power set strictly larger size even infinite set result soon became known cantor's theorem
cantor developed entire theory arithmetic infinite sets called cardinals ordinals extended arithmetic natural numbers
notation cardinal numbers hebrew letter aleph natural number subscript ordinals employed greek letter ω omega
notation still use today
continuum hypothesis introduced cantor presented david hilbert first twenty-three open problems address 1900 international congress mathematicians paris
cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond hilbert's celebrated encomium
us philosopher charles sanders peirce praised cantor's set theory following public lectures delivered cantor first international congress mathematicians held zurich 1897 hurwitz hadamard also both expressed their admiration
congress cantor renewed friendship correspondence dedekind
1905 cantor corresponded british admirer translator philip jourdain history set theory cantor's religious ideas
later published several expository works
number theory trigonometric series ordinals cantor's first ten papers number theory thesis topic
suggestion eduard heine professor halle cantor turned analysis
heine proposed cantor solve open problem eluded peter gustav lejeune dirichlet rudolf lipschitz bernhard riemann heine himself uniqueness representation function trigonometric series
cantor solved difficult problem 1869
while working problem discovered transfinite ordinals occurred indices n nth derived set sn set s zeros trigonometric series
given trigonometric series fx s set zeros cantor discovered procedure produced another trigonometric series s1 set zeros s1 set limit points s
sk+1 set limit points sk then construct trigonometric series whose zeros sk+1
because sets sk closed contained their limit points intersection infinite decreasing sequence sets s s1 s2 s3
formed limit set now call sω then noticed sω also set limit points sω+1
examples went forever here naturally occurring infinite sequence infinite numbers ω ω + ω + 2
1870 1872 cantor published papers trigonometric series also paper defining irrational numbers convergent sequences rational numbers
dedekind whom cantor befriended 1872 cited paper later year paper first set out celebrated definition real numbers dedekind cuts
while extending notion number means revolutionary concept infinite cardinality cantor paradoxically opposed theories infinitesimals contemporaries otto stolz paul du bois-reymond describing them both abomination cholera bacillus mathematics
cantor also published erroneous proof inconsistency infinitesimals
set theory illustration cantor's diagonal argument existence uncountable sets
sequence bottom cannot occur anywhere infinite list sequences above
beginning set theory branch mathematics often marked publication cantor's 1874 article über eine eigenschaft des inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen zahlen property collection real algebraic numbers
article first provide rigorous proof there kind infinity
previously infinite collections implicitly assumed equinumerous same size having same number elements
cantor proved collection real numbers collection positive integers equinumerous
other words real numbers countable
proof differs diagonal argument gave 1891
cantor's article also contains new method constructing transcendental numbers
transcendental numbers first constructed joseph liouville 1844
cantor established these results using two constructions
first construction shows how write real algebraic numbers sequence a1 a2 a3
other words real algebraic numbers countable
cantor starts second construction any sequence real numbers
using sequence constructs nested intervals whose intersection contains real number sequence
since every sequence real numbers used construct real sequence real numbers cannot written sequence real numbers countable
applying construction sequence real algebraic numbers cantor produces transcendental number
cantor points out constructions prove namely provide new proof liouville's theorem every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers
cantor's next article contains construction proves set transcendental numbers same power see below set real numbers
passage georg cantor's article set definition 1879 1884 cantor published series six articles mathematische annalen together formed introduction set theory
same time there growing opposition cantor's ideas led kronecker admitted mathematical concepts constructed finite number steps natural numbers took intuitively given
kronecker cantor's hierarchy infinities inadmissible since accepting concept actual infinity open door paradoxes challenge validity mathematics whole
cantor also introduced cantor set during period
fifth paper series grundlagen einer allgemeinen mannigfaltigkeitslehre foundations general theory aggregates published 1883 most important six also published separate monograph
contained cantor's reply critics showed how transfinite numbers systematic extension natural numbers
begins defining well-ordered sets
ordinal numbers then introduced order types well-ordered sets
cantor then defines addition multiplication cardinal ordinal numbers
1885 cantor extended theory order types ordinal numbers simply became special case order types
1891 published paper containing elegant diagonal argument existence uncountable set
applied same idea prove cantor's theorem cardinality power set set strictly larger cardinality
established richness hierarchy infinite sets cardinal ordinal arithmetic cantor defined
argument fundamental solution halting problem proof gödel's first incompleteness theorem
cantor goldbach conjecture 1894
1895 1897 cantor published two-part paper mathematische annalen under felix klein's editorship these last significant papers set theory
first paper begins defining set subset etc
ways largely acceptable now
cardinal ordinal arithmetic reviewed
cantor wanted second paper include proof continuum hypothesis settle expositing theory well-ordered sets ordinal numbers
cantor attempts prove sets equivalent subset equivalent subset then equivalent
ernst schröder stated theorem bit earlier proof well cantor's flawed
felix bernstein supplied correct proof 1898 ph thesis hence name cantor–bernstein–schroeder theorem
one-to-one correspondence main article bijection bijective function
cantor's 1874 crelle paper first invoke notion 1-to-1 correspondence though use phrase
then began looking 1-to-1 correspondence points unit square points unit line segment
1877 letter richard dedekind cantor proved far stronger result any positive integer n there exists 1-to-1 correspondence points unit line segment points n-dimensional space
discovery cantor dedekind je le vois mais je ne le crois pas! see don't believe it! result found astonishing implications geometry notion dimension
1878 cantor submitted another paper crelle's journal defined precisely concept 1-to-1 correspondence introduced notion power term took jakob steiner equivalence sets two sets equivalent same power there exists 1-to-1 correspondence them
cantor defined countable sets denumerable sets sets put 1-to-1 correspondence natural numbers proved rational numbers denumerable
also proved n-dimensional euclidean space rn same power real numbers r does countably infinite product copies r
while made free use countability concept write word countable until 1883
cantor also discussed thinking dimension stressing mapping unit interval unit square continuous
paper displeased kronecker cantor wanted withdraw however dedekind persuaded weierstrass supported publication
nevertheless cantor never again submitted anything crelle
continuum hypothesis main article continuum hypothesis cantor first formulate later came known continuum hypothesis ch there exists no set whose power greater naturals less reals equivalently cardinality reals exactly aleph-one rather just least aleph-one
cantor believed continuum hypothesis true tried many years prove vain
inability prove continuum hypothesis caused considerable anxiety
difficulty cantor proving continuum hypothesis underscored later developments field mathematics 1940 result gödel 1963 paul cohen together imply continuum hypothesis neither proved nor disproved using standard zermelo–fraenkel set theory plus axiom choice combination referred zfc
paradoxes set theory discussions set-theoretic paradoxes began appear around end nineteenth century
these implied fundamental problems cantor's set theory program
1897 paper unrelated topic cesare burali-forti set out first such paradox burali-forti paradox ordinal number set ordinals must ordinal leads contradiction
cantor discovered paradox 1895 described 1896 letter hilbert
criticism mounted point cantor launched counter-arguments 1903 intended defend basic tenets set theory
1899 cantor discovered eponymous paradox cardinal number set sets? clearly must greatest possible cardinal
yet any set cardinal number power set strictly larger cardinal number fact now known cantor's theorem
paradox together burali-forti paradox led cantor formulate concept called limitation size according collection ordinals sets inconsistent multiplicity too large set
such collections later became known proper classes
common view among mathematicians these paradoxes together russell's paradox demonstrate possible take naive non-axiomatic approach set theory without risking contradiction certain among motivations zermelo others produce axiomatizations set theory
others note however paradoxes obtain informal view motivated iterative hierarchy seen explaining idea limitation size
also question whether fregean formulation naive set theory system directly refuted russell paradox really faithful interpretation cantorian conception
philosophy religion cantor's mathematics concept existence actual infinity important shared concern within realms mathematics philosophy religion
preserving orthodoxy relationship god mathematics although same form held critics long concern cantor's
directly addressed intersection these disciplines introduction grundlagen einer allgemeinen mannigfaltigkeitslehre stressed connection view infinite philosophical
cantor mathematical views intrinsically linked their philosophical theological implications identified absolute infinite god considered work transfinite numbers directly communicated god chosen cantor reveal them world
debate among mathematicians grew out opposing views philosophy mathematics regarding nature actual infinity
held view infinity abstraction mathematically legitimate denied existence
mathematicians three major schools thought constructivism two offshoots intuitionism finitism opposed cantor's theories matter
constructivists such kronecker rejection actual infinity stems fundamental disagreement idea nonconstructive proofs such cantor's diagonal argument sufficient proof something exists holding instead constructive proofs required
intuitionism also rejects idea actual infinity expression any sort reality arrive decision via different route constructivism
firstly cantor's argument rests logic prove existence transfinite numbers actual mathematical entity whereas intuitionists hold mathematical entities cannot reduced logical propositions originating instead intuitions mind
secondly notion infinity expression reality itself disallowed intuitionism since human mind cannot intuitively construct infinite set
mathematicians such brouwer especially poincaré adopted intuitionist stance against cantor's work
citing paradoxes set theory example fundamentally flawed nature poincaré held most ideas cantorian set theory should banished mathematics once
finally wittgenstein's attacks finitist believed cantor's diagonal argument conflated intension set cardinal real numbers extension thus conflating concept rules generating set actual set
christian theologians saw cantor's work challenge uniqueness absolute infinity nature god
particular neo-thomist thinkers saw existence actual infinity consisted something other god jeopardizing god's exclusive claim supreme infinity
cantor strongly believed view misinterpretation infinity convinced set theory help correct mistake
transfinite species just much disposal intentions creator absolute boundless will finite numbers
cantor also believed theory transfinite numbers ran counter both materialism determinism shocked realized faculty member halle hold deterministic philosophical beliefs
1888 cantor published correspondence several philosophers philosophical implications set theory
extensive attempt persuade other christian thinkers authorities adopt views cantor corresponded christian philosophers such tilman pesch joseph hontheim well theologians such cardinal johannes franzelin once replied equating theory transfinite numbers pantheism
cantor even sent letter directly pope leo xiii himself addressed several pamphlets
cantor's philosophy nature numbers led affirm belief freedom mathematics posit prove concepts apart realm physical phenomena expressions within internal reality
restrictions metaphysical system mathematical concepts must devoid internal contradiction follow existing definitions axioms theorems
belief summarized assertion essence mathematics freedom
these ideas parallel those edmund husserl whom cantor met halle
meanwhile cantor himself fiercely opposed infinitesimals describing them both abomination cholera bacillus mathematics
cantor's 1883 paper reveals well aware opposition ideas encountering
realize undertaking place myself certain opposition views widely held concerning mathematical infinite opinions frequently defended nature numbers
hence devotes much space justifying earlier work asserting mathematical concepts may freely introduced long free contradiction defined terms previously accepted concepts
also cites aristotle descartes berkeley leibniz bolzano infinity

critique bell's book contained joseph dauben's biography
writes dauben cantor devoted most vituperative correspondence well portion beiträge attacking described point 'infinitesimal cholera bacillus mathematics' spread germany through work thomae du bois reymond stolz infect italian mathematics
any acceptance infinitesimals necessarily meant own theory number incomplete
thus accept work thomae du bois-reymond stolz veronese deny perfection cantor's own creation
