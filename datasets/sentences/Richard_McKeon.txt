philosophy pluralism mc keon published 158 articles over span seven decades
evidence pluralist influence evident particular doctrine system rather plurality articles
scope work extends virtually philosophies whole cultural history western world while being ordered semantic schema
early academic career mc keon recognized truth no single expression
understanding philosophical historical semantics led value philosophies quite different own
viewed aim pluralism achieving monolithic identity rather diversity opinion along mutual tolerance
characterized philosophy philosophy culture also humanistic philosophy communications arts philosophical rhetoric
value philosophic position determined demonstrating value explanation instrument discovery
pragmatism richard rorty owes much mc keon teacher
mc keon's operational method method debate allows refine their positions turn determining limits their perception opponent's argument
opposition provides necessary perspective
notwithstanding does necessarily acquire characteristics perspectives opposed philosophy nature resists being pinned down single name
meant affirm value credibility any philosophies
essentially pluralism closely related objectivity desired outcome communication discussion fundamental goal principle being human
human beings come together around common issues and/or problems their different interests perspectives often obstacle collective action
mc keon's pluralism insists understand person means say
believes proper discussion lead agreement courses action cases mutual understanding eventual agreement issues ideology philosophic belief
work jürgen habermas close affinities mc keon
conflicting concepts interests assumptions concern society form ecology culture
discussion forms object transformation subject product held common outcome
mc keon's philosophy similar rhetoric conceived aristotle whereby power employed any given situation available means persuasion
pluralism perspectives essential component our existence
nonetheless effort form our individual perspectives through thought action brings us touch being human being other individuals
mc keon understanding pluralism gives us access whatever may grasped being itself
new rhetoric later stages mc keon's academic career started giving attention world problems see unesco
sought improve individual disciplines felt meant improve mankind
refurbishing rhetoric necessary because outlining needs antecedents tasks imposed upon general character affiliations rhetoric both solve problems communicate solutions people everywhere
our age produces new data experiences require new expanded rhetoric takes account technology
modern world progressed quite far yet found logos able make sense techne technology = techne + logos
sciences alone cannot hope productive without reincorporating rhetoric otherwise analytic
mc keon new rhetoric means bridging gap arts sciences
incorporating rhetoric may permit further development new fields arts sciences
rhetoric able navigate among various kinds arts sciences providing opportunity interrelate them set new ends makes use both spheres
new rhetoric order other arts sciences resulting new discoveries
mckeon deemed very forceful rhetorical strategy capable avoiding relativism very forceful rhetorical strategy solidarity gained people supposedly unified via forceful rhetoric
relativism avoided according mc keon via force rhetorical strategy rather via access platonic realm
mc keon borrows traditional rhetorical terms see aristotle quintillian outline principles new rhetoric creativity/invention fact/judgment sequence/consequence objectivity/intersubjectivity then leads them toward brighter avenues discovery enlarging aristotle's traditional rhetorical categories epideictic judicial deliberative reintegrating philosophical dialectic
believes materials doing topoi schemata
new rhetoric must universal objective reformulate structure program verbal rhetoric subjects applications must focused particular now
mc keon now 'mined' contribute future resolution important problematic
here again impact mc keon richard rorty evident
john dewey now richard rorty mc keon deemed philosophy basically problem solving endeavor
basically there two sorts solidarity searched those employ rhetorical strategy solidarity those goal solidarity those via 'values' work towards goal those goal
solidarity searched solidarity those no 'values' rather rhetoric other solidarity searched solidariy those no goal rather 'values'
new data may cause new problems rhetoric will still continue produce categories attempt find new kinds topoi will produce new classifications create new interdisciplinary fields
rhetoric helps figure out how create these fields how decide existing fields appropriate various data
new rhetoric will find new kinds ends guiding technology service those ends collaboration other arts rather allowing technology lead us restricted potentially harmful ends
whatever 'values' deemed lead solution problem rhetorically deemed worthy
problematic mc keon rhetoric supposed contribute solution problematic
clearly rhetoric unable come up clear plan solution rhetoric being rhetoric
rather via rhetoric 'values' ennunciated supposed eventually gain goal
employs rhetoric gain goal basically attempting via brute force gain end
assuming goal gained corollary rhetoric those end end now abandon end eschew end 'value' now develop new goals new rhetorics
getting way ahead game though given track record rhetoric
rhetoric repeatedly tried down centuries repeatedly associated disaster though irrelevant those attempting rhetoric rhetoric deemed achieve goals brute force those practice rhetoric rhetoric also failed achieve ends
those espoused rhetoric achieved valued though precarious positions
work richard mc keon shows despite multiple great failures even up 20 th century rhetoric following aristotle continued 'put spell over people'
