knowledge nature portrait gerolamo cardano cardano's philosophy heavily influenced characteristic trends late scholastic aristotelianism strong penchant averroist interpretations
cardano shows great interest averroes' opinion intellect perform intellective functions human beings
however tends provide historicized version radical view looks intellect varying amount learning accumulated mankind throughout centuries rather simply justifying purely epistemological point view seen intellective power actualises life knowledge sublunary world whole
cardano's philosophy also displays clear traces platonic influences absorbed through reading marsilio ficino's recent translations commentaries especially plotinus iamblichus
together impressive knowledge astrological medical literature both scholasticism platonism give characteristically vitalistic slant cosmological views
cardano's philosophy often described suggestive rich original intuitions cluttered inconsistent whole
fact philosophical work yet another example common during renaissance how different philosophical traditions converge composite coherent picture
throughout life early endeavours 1540 last philosophical attempt cardano demonstrated distinctive commitment certain number philosophical issues relationship oneness multiplicity notable corollaries dealing order disorder determinism chance life decay view intellect ultimate principle reality knowledge general theory celestial heat described main formative agent nature interplay nature soul organization universe general doctrine immortality soul seen foundation both cognitive clarity moral certitude
whole originality cardano's eclecticism lies unique way characterizes interdependence life knowledge matter pronounced sense reality truth constantly being questioned jeopardised realistic view human nature mercilessly presented prone fear delusion deceit
cardano's cosmological views belong long-established system astrobiological doctrines whose origins go back aristotelian physics hippocratic vitalism fundamental assumptions underlying tradition astrological meteorological learning reshaped through series hebrew arabic mediations
account supralunary world combines elements neoplatonic philosophy christian theology

principal constituents sublunary world matter earth water air celestial heat wide variety souls spanning demonic minds substantial forms understood specific principles life
line principles greek ontology cardano maintains nothing comes out nothing rather things derive something something cannot infinite
aristotle called something “hyle prime matter” cardano prefers discard notion intermediate entity being non being replacing view elements material starting point celestial heat efficient active principle “for otherwise elements completely redundant there prime matter”
elements represent first level organization matter three four demanded aristotelian scholastic physics earth water air
fire cardano considers product celestial heat various streams vital energy flowing supralunary sources life knowledge pervade universe living organism
innate heat celestial origin active element mediates state utter immobility characterizes intelligible substances incessant mobility defines life material beings
through exercise introspective analysis cardano enumerates three principles regulate both our inner life life created things “is moved does move resulting heavy elements” another “moves moved soul” third finally “is moved soul” moves body
innate heat
question whether soul identified celestial heat cardano replies unlike latter former incorporeal does occupy any place therefore never motion
also motion does level self-stability necessary being able perceive think
cardano's metaphysics matter form complementary nature there cannot matter without form forms body
forms represent primordial stage process through created universe becomes living being
difference souls forms souls albeit involved animation bodies remain nevertheless unaffected corporeal reality
up higher level minds souls completely independent matter bodies motion
however even within ontological sphere minds there varying degrees embodiment
while highest celestial intelligences wholly separated material cosmos demonic substances albeit incorporeal affect corporeal world through forces influences various kind
these “that force connected demons regardless whether power corporeal depends humours incorporeal
cardano maintains through forces nature “the parts universe aroused demons stars other hidden cause”
principle way collects administers these currents celestial energy soul world
cardano's system astro-biological determinism universal soul keeps whole cosmos together performs paramount operations accordance original plan devised god implemented planetary intelligences “all things influenced higher heaven moved command soul world
soul world “cannot understood without god” directs work nature “in process generating things produces supercelestial lives multiplicity”
sublunary world major operations life generation performed nature understood source teleological activity supervised intellect soul world
complex relationship soul nature role played celestial forces crucial point cardano's philosophy
