editions beccaria's text follow two distinct arrangements material beccaria himself french translator andre morellet 1765 imposed systematic order beccaria's original text
beccaria opens work describing great need reform criminal justice system observes how few studies there subject such reform
throughout work beccaria develops position appealing two key philosophical theories social contract utility
concerning social contract beccaria argues punishment justified defend social contract ensure everyone will motivated abide
concerning utility perhaps influenced helvetius beccaria argues method punishment selected should serves greatest public good
contemporary political philosophers distinguish two principal theories justifying punishment
first retributive approach maintains punishment should equal harm done either literally eye eye figuratively allows alternative forms compensation
retributive approach tends retaliatory vengeance-oriented
second approach utilitarian maintains punishment should increase total amount happiness world
often involves punishment means reforming criminal incapacitating repeating crime deterring others
beccaria clearly takes utilitarian stance
beccaria purpose punishment create better society revenge
punishment serves deter others committing crimes prevent criminal repeating crime
beccaria argues punishment should swift since greatest deterrence value
defends view swiftness punishment appealing theory association ideas developed most notably david hume david hartley
according associationists know rules mind connects together two different ideas such ideas crime punishment then strengthen their association
beccaria punishment quickly follows crime then two ideas crime punishment will quickly associated person's mind
also link crime punishment stronger punishment somehow related crime
given fact swiftness punishment greatest impact deterring others beccaria argues there no justification severe punishments
time will naturally grow accustomed increases severity punishment thus initial increase severity will lose effect
there limits both how much torment endure also how much inflict
cesare beccaria dei delitti e delle pene beccaria touches array criminal justice practices recommending reform
example argues dueling eliminated laws protected person insults honor
laws against suicide ineffective thus should eliminated leaving punishment suicide god
bounty hunting should permitted since incites people immoral shows weakness government
argues laws should clear defining crimes judges interpret law decide whether law broken
punishments should degree severity crime
treason worst crime since harms social contract
followed violence against person property finally public disruption
crimes against property should punished fines
best ways prevent crimes enact clear simple laws reward virtue improve education
three tenets served basis beccaria’s theories criminal justice free will rational manner manipulability
according beccaria—and most classical theorists—free will enables people make choices
beccaria believed people rational manner apply toward making choices will help them achieve their own personal gratification
beccaria’s interpretation law exists preserve social contract benefit society whole
because people act out self-interest their interest sometimes conflicts societal laws commit crimes
principle manipulability refers predictable ways people act out rational self-interest might therefore dissuaded committing crimes punishment outweighs benefits crime rendering crime illogical choice
principles beccaria appealed reason understanding state form contract above principle utility greatest happiness greatest number
beccaria elaborated original principle conjunction pietro verri greatly influenced jeremy bentham develop full-scale doctrine utilitarianism
openly condemned death penalty two grounds first because state does possess right take lives secondly because capital punishment neither useful nor necessary form punishment
