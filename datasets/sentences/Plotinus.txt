eunapius reported plotinus born deltaic lycopolis egypt led speculations may native egyptian roman greek hellenized egyptian descent
plotinus inherent distrust materiality attitude common platonism holding view phenomena poor image mimicry mimesis something higher intelligible [vi
i] truer part genuine being
distrust extended body including own reported porphyry point refused portrait painted presumably much same reasons dislike
likewise plotinus never discussed ancestry childhood place date birth
accounts personal social life exhibited highest moral spiritual standards
plotinus took up study philosophy age twenty-seven around year 232 travelled alexandria study
there dissatisfied every teacher encountered until acquaintance suggested listen ideas ammonius saccas
upon hearing ammonius lecture declared friend man looking began study intently under new instructor
besides ammonius plotinus also influenced works alexander aphrodisias numenius various stoics
expedition persia return rome after spending next eleven years alexandria then decided age around 38 investigate philosophical teachings persian philosophers indian philosophers
pursuit endeavor left alexandria joined army gordian iii marched persia
however campaign failure gordian's eventual death plotinus found himself abandoned hostile land difficulty found way back safety antioch
age forty during reign philip arab came rome stayed most remainder life
there attracted number students
innermost circle included porphyry amelius gentilianus tuscany senator castricius firmus eustochius alexandria doctor devoted himself learning plotinus attending until death
other students included zethos arab ancestry died before plotinus leaving legacy land zoticus critic poet paulinus doctor scythopolis serapion alexandria
students amongst roman senate beside castricius such marcellus orontius sabinillus rogantianus
women also numbered amongst students including gemina whose house lived during residence rome her daughter also gemina amphiclea wife ariston son iamblichus
finally plotinus correspondent philosopher cassius longinus
later life while rome plotinus also gained respect emperor gallienus wife salonina
point plotinus attempted interest gallienus rebuilding abandoned settlement campania known 'city philosophers' inhabitants live under constitution set out plato's laws
imperial subsidy never granted reasons unknown porphyry reports incident
porphyry subsequently went live sicily word reached former teacher died
philosopher spent final days seclusion estate campania friend zethos bequeathed
according account eustochius attended end plotinus' final words strive give back divine yourselves divine
[the six enneads translated stephen mackenna
eustochius records snake crept under bed plotinus lay slipped away through hole wall same moment philosopher died
plotinus essays became enneads over period several years ca
253 until few months before death seventeen years later
porphyry makes note enneads before being compiled arranged himself merely enormous collection notes essays plotinus used lectures debates rather formal book
plotinus unable revise own work due poor eyesight yet writings required extensive editing according porphyry master's handwriting atrocious properly separate words cared little niceties spelling
plotinus intensely disliked editorial process turned task porphyry polished them put them arrangement now
major ideas see also substance theory plotinus taught there supreme totally transcendent containing no division multiplicity distinction beyond categories being non-being
cannot any existing thing nor merely sum things [compare stoic doctrine disbelief non-material existence] prior existents
plotinus identified concept 'good' principle 'beauty'
9] concept encompassed thinker object
even self-contemplating intelligence noesis nous must contain duality
once you uttered 'the good' add no further thought any addition proportion addition you introduce deficiency
11] plotinus denies sentience self-awareness any other action ergon [v
rather insist describing further must call sheer potentiality dynamis without nothing exist
10] plotinus explains both places elsewhere [e
3] impossible being self-aware creator god
4] plotinus compared light divine nous first will towards good sun lastly soul moon whose light merely derivative conglomeration light 'sun'
first light exist without any celestial body
being beyond attributes including being non-being source world—but through any act creation willful otherwise since activity cannot ascribed unchangeable immutable
plotinus argues instead multiple cannot exist without simple
less perfect must necessity emanate issue forth perfect perfect
thus creation emanates succeeding stages lesser lesser perfection
these stages temporally isolated occur throughout time constant process
later neoplatonic philosophers especially iamblichus added hundreds intermediate beings emanations humanity plotinus' system much simpler comparison
[citation needed] just intellectual conception something experienced experience goes beyond multiplicity
plotinus writes ought even say will see will sees indeed possible any longer distinguish seer seen boldly affirm two
emanation plotinus offers alternative orthodox christian notion creation ex nihilo out nothing attributes god deliberation mind action will although plotinus never mentions christianity any works
emanation ex deo out god confirms absolute transcendence making unfolding cosmos purely consequence existence no way affected diminished these emanations
plotinus uses analogy sun emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself reflection mirror no way diminishes otherwise alters object being reflected
[citation needed] first emanation nous divine mind logos order thought reason identified metaphorically demiurge plato's timaeus
first will toward good
nous proceeds world soul plotinus subdivides upper lower identifying lower aspect soul nature
world soul proceeds individual human souls finally matter lowest level being thus least perfected level cosmos
despite relatively pedestrian assessment material world plotinus asserted ultimately divine nature material creation since ultimately derives through mediums nous world soul
good through beauty recognize material things then forms
essentially devotional nature plotinus' philosophy may further illustrated concept attaining ecstatic union henosis
porphyry relates plotinus attained such union four times during years knew
may related enlightenment liberation other concepts mystical union common many eastern western traditions

october 2015 philosophy plotinus exerted peculiar fascination upon those whose discontent things led them seek realities behind took merely appearances sense
philosophy plotinus representative books enneads p
vii authentic human happiness plotinus consists true human identifying best universe
because happiness beyond anything physical plotinus stresses point worldly fortune does control true human happiness thus “… there exists no single human being does either potentially effectively possess thing hold constitute happiness
4 issue happiness plotinus’ greatest imprints western thought first introduce idea eudaimonia happiness attainable within consciousness
aristotle exactly approximately 500 years beforehand- see nicomachean ethics book 10 section
true human incorporeal contemplative capacity soul superior things corporeal
then follows real human happiness independent physical world
real happiness instead dependent metaphysical authentic human being found highest capacity reason
“for man especially proficient couplement soul body proof man disengaged body disdain nominal goods
14 human achieved happiness will bothered sickness discomfort etc
focus greatest things
authentic human happiness utilization most authentically human capacity contemplation
even daily physical action flourishing human’s “…act determined higher phase soul
enneads iii
6 even most dramatic arguments plotinus considers proficient subject extreme physical torture example concludes strengthens claim true happiness being metaphysical truly happy human being understand being tortured merely body conscious self happiness persist
plotinus offers comprehensive description conception person achieved eudaimonia
“the perfect life” involves man commands reason contemplation
4 happy person will sway happy sad many plotinus’ contemporaries believed
stoics example question ability someone happy presupposing happiness contemplation mentally incapacitated even asleep
plotinus disregards claim soul true human sleep even exist time nor will living human achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using greatest most authentic capacity just because body’s discomfort physical realm
“…the proficient’s will set inward
overall happiness plotinus
flight world's ways things
theat 176 ab focus highest
against causal astrology plotinus seems first argue against still popular notion causal astrology
late tractate 2
3 stars causes? plotinus makes argument specific stars influencing one's fortune common hellenistic theme attributes irrationality perfect universe invites moral turpitude
[clarification needed] does however claim stars planets ensouled witnessed their movement
plotinus's relation plato see also allegorical interpretations plato several centuries after protestant reformation neo-platonism condemned decadent 'oriental' distortion platonism
famous 1929 essay e
dodds showed key conceptions neo-platonism traced their origin plato's dialogues through immediate followers e
speusippus neo-pythagoreans plotinus neo-platonists
thus plotinus' philosophy argued 'not starting-point neo-platonism intellectual culmination
further research reinforced view 1954 merlan say 'the present tendency toward bridging rather widening gap separating platonism neo-platonism
since 1950's tübingen school plato interpretation argued so-called 'unwritten doctrines' plato debated aristotle early academy strongly resemble plotinus's metaphysics
case neo-platonic reading plato least central area historically justified
implies neo-platonism less innovation appears without recognition plato's unwritten doctrines
advocates tübingen school emphasize advantage their interpretation
see plotinus advancing tradition thought begun plato himself
plotinus's metaphysics least broad outline therefore already familiar first generation plato's students
confirms plotinus' own view considered himself inventor system faithful interpreter plato's doctrines
plotinus gnostics see also neoplatonism gnosticism least two modern conferences within hellenic philosophy fields study held order address plotinus stated tract against gnostics addressing order separate clarify events persons involved origin term gnostic
dialogue appears word origin platonic hellenistic tradition long before group calling themselves gnostics—or group covered under modern term gnosticism—ever appeared
seem shift platonic gnostic usage led many people confusion
strategy sectarians taking greek terms philosophical contexts re-applying them religious contexts popular christianity cult isis other ancient religious contexts including hermetic ones see alexander abonutichus example
plotinus neoplatonists viewed gnosticism form heresy sectarianism pythagorean platonic philosophy mediterranean middle east
[note 1] accused them using senseless jargon being overly dramatic insolent their distortion plato's ontology
[note 2] plotinus attacks opponents untraditional irrational immoral[note 3][note 4] arrogant
[note 5] also attacks them elitist blasphemous plato gnostics despising material world maker
[note 6] neoplatonic movement though plotinus simply referred himself philosopher plato seems motivated desire plotinus revive pagan philosophical tradition
[note 7] plotinus claiming innovate enneads clarify aspects works plato considered misrepresented misunderstood
plotinus does claim innovator rather communicator tradition
plotinus referred tradition way interpret plato's intentions
because teachings plato members academy rather general public easy outsiders misunderstand plato's meaning
however plotinus attempted clarify how philosophers academy arrived same conclusions such misotheism dystheism creator god answer problem evil targets criticism
influence ancient world emperor julian apostate deeply influenced neoplatonism hypatia alexandria well many christians most notably pseudo-dionysius areopagite
augustine though often referred platonist acquired platonist philosophy through mediation neoplatonist teachings plotinus
[citation needed] christianity plotinus' philosophy great influence development christian theology
history western philosophy philosopher bertrand russell christian other world kingdom heaven enjoyed after death platonist eternal world ideas real world opposed illusory appearance
christian theologians combined these points view embodied much philosophy plotinus
plotinus accordingly historically important influence moulding christianity middle ages theology
eastern orthodox position energy example often contrasted position roman catholic church part attributed varying interpretations aristotle plotinus either through thomas aquinas roman catholics gregory nyssa orthodox christians
[citation needed] islam neoplatonism ideas plotinus influenced medieval islam well since sunni abbasids fused greek concepts sponsored state texts found great influence amongst ismaili shia
