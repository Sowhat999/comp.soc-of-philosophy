original quote part speech made 1979 found here cannot imagine no wise person presume claim spared our bloods watermelon becomes cheaper
no wise person sacrifice young offspring [say] affordable housing
people [on contrary] want everything their young offspring
human being wants economy own self therefore unwise spare life order improve economy [
those keep bringing up economy find economy infrastructure everything -not knowing human[ity] means- think human being animal defined means food clothes[
those find economy infrastructure everything find human beings animals
animal too sacrifices everything economy economy sole infrastructure
donkey too considers economy infrastructure
these people realize human being [truly]
