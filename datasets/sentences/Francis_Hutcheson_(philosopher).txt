thus hutcheson dealt metaphysics logic ethics
importance however due almost entirely ethical writings among these primarily four essays letters published during time dublin
standpoint negative positive aspect strong opposition thomas hobbes mandeville fundamental agreement shaftesbury whose name very properly coupled own title page first two essays
obvious fundamental points agreement two authors include analogy drawn beauty virtue functions assigned moral sense position benevolent feelings form original irreducible part our nature unhesitating adoption principle test virtuous action tendency promote general welfare
ethics according hutcheson man variety senses internal well external reflex well direct general definition sense being any determination our minds receive ideas independently our will perceptions pleasure pain essay nature conduct passions sect
does attempt give exhaustive enumeration these senses various parts works specifies besides five external senses commonly recognized hints might added consciousness each man perception himself going own mind metaph
2 sense beauty sometimes called specifically internal sense public sense sensus communis determination pleased happiness others uneasy their misery moral sense moral sense beauty actions affections perceive virtue vice ourselves others sense honour praise blame makes approbation gratitude others necessary occasion pleasure their dislike condemnation resentment injuries done us occasion uneasy sensation called shame sense ridiculous
plain author confesses there may other perceptions distinct these classes fact there seems no limit number senses psychological division kind might result
these senses moral sense plays most important part hutcheson's ethical system
pronounces immediately character actions affections approving those virtuous disapproving those vicious
principal design says preface two first treatises show human nature left quite indifferent affair virtue form itself observations concerning advantage disadvantage actions accordingly regulate conduct
weakness our reason avocations arising infirmity necessities our nature great very few men ever formed those long deductions reasons show actions whole advantageous agent their contraries pernicious
author nature much better furnished us virtuous conduct our moralists seem imagine almost quick powerful instructions preservation our bodies
made virtue lovely form excite our pursuit given us strong affections springs each virtuous action
passing over appeal final causes involved passage well assumption moral sense no growth history implanted man exactly found among civilized races assumption common both hutcheson butler use term sense tends obscure real nature process moral judgement
established hume act consists two parts act deliberation leading intellectual judgement reflex feeling satisfaction actions consider good dissatisfaction those consider bad
intellectual part process refer action habit certain class no sooner intellectual process complete there excited us feeling similar myriads actions habits apparently same class excited us former occasions
even latter part process instantaneous uniform exempt error former
mankind may approve virtuous makes general good entertain most widely divergent opinions frequently arrive directly opposite conclusions particular actions habits
hutcheson recognizes obvious distinction analysis mental process preceding moral action does ignore even writing moral approbation disapprobation follows action
nonetheless hutcheson both phraseology language uses describe process moral approbation done much favour loose popular view morality ignoring necessity deliberation reflection encourages hasty resolves unpremeditated judgements
term moral sense may noticed already employed shaftesbury william whewell suggests margin also text inquiry invariably coupled term moral judgement open little objection taken alone designating complex process moral approbation liable lead serious misapprehension grave practical errors
each person's decisions solely result immediate intuition moral sense why any pains test correct review them? why educate faculty whose decisions infallible? how account differences moral decisions different societies observable changes person's own views? expression fact fault most metaphorical terms leads exaggeration truth intended suggest
though hutcheson usually describes moral faculty acting instinctively immediately does like butler conflate moral faculty moral standard
test criterion right action hutcheson shaftesbury tendency promote general welfare mankind
thus anticipates utilitarianism bentham—and principle even use phrase greatest happiness greatest number inquiry concerning moral good evil sect
hutcheson does seem seen inconsistency external criterion fundamental ethical principle
intuition no possible connection empirical calculation results hutcheson adopting such criterion practically denies fundamental assumption
connected hutcheson's virtual adoption utilitarian standard kind moral algebra proposed purpose computing morality actions
calculus occurs inquiry concerning moral good evil sect
hutcheson's other distinctive ethical doctrine called benevolent theory morals
hobbes maintained other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy their roots self-love
hutcheson maintains benevolence sole direct source many our actions unnatural recoil source those actions reflection approve
consistently position actions flow self-love morally indifferent
surely common consent civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry self-respect general personal virtues regarded rightly regarded fitting objects moral approbation
consideration hardly escape any author however wedded own system hutcheson attempts extricate himself difficulty laying down position man may justly regard himself part rational system may thus part object own benevolence ibid--a curious abuse terms really concedes question issue
moreover acknowledges though self-love does merit approbation neither except extreme forms merit condemnation indeed satisfaction dictates self-love very conditions preservation society
press home inconsistencies involved these various statement superfluous task
vexed question liberty necessity appears carefully avoided hutcheson's professedly ethical works
synopsis metaphysicae touches three places briefly stating both sides question evidently inclining designates opinion stoics opposition designates opinion peripatetics
substantially same doctrine propounded hobbes locke latter whom hutcheson refers note namely our will determined motives conjunction our general character habit mind true liberty liberty acting will liberty willing will
though however leaning clear carefully avoids dogmatising deprecates angry controversies speculation subject given rise
easy trace influence hutcheson's ethical theories systems hume adam smith
prominence given these writers analysis moral action moral approbation attempt discriminate respective provinces reason emotions these processes undoubtedly due influence hutcheson
study writings shaftesbury hutcheson might probably large measure attribute unequivocal adoption utilitarian standard hume case name hutcheson connects itself through hume names priestley paley bentham
butler's sermons appeared 1726 year after publication hutcheson's two first essays there parallels conscience writer moral sense other

locke does speak god annexing certain ideas certain motions bodies nowhere does propound theory definite here propounded hutcheson reminds us least much speculations nicolas malebranche those locke
amongst important points hutcheson diverges locke account idea personal identity appears regarded made known us directly consciousness

thus estimating hutcheson's position find particular questions stands nearer locke general spirit philosophy seems approach closely scottish successors
short compendium logic original such works usually remarkable chiefly large proportion psychological matter contains
these parts book hutcheson mainly follows locke
technicalities subject passed lightly over book readable
may specially noticed distinguishes mental result verbal expression judgment-proposition constantly employs word idea defines logical truth convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis syn
cap 3 thus implicitly repudiating merely formal view logic
aesthetics hutcheson may further regarded earliest modern writers aesthetics
speculations subject contained inquiry concerning beauty order harmony design first two treatises published 1725
maintains endowed special sense perceive beauty harmony proportion
reflex sense because presupposes action external senses sight hearing
may called internal sense both distinguish perceptions mere perceptions sight hearing because other affairs our external senses much concerned discern sort beauty very like many respects observed sensible objects accompanied like pleasure inquiry etc
latter reason leads call attention beauty perceived universal truths operations general causes moral principles actions
thus analogy beauty virtue favourite topic shaftesbury prominent writings hutcheson also
