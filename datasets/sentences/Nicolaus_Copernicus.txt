whatever motion appears firmament arises any motion firmament earth's motion
earth together circumjacent elements performs complete rotation fixed poles daily motion while firmament highest heaven abide unchanged

earth then motion

intellectual climate time remained dominated aristotelian philosophy corresponding ptolemaic astronomy
time there no reason accept copernican theory except mathematical simplicity [by avoiding using equant determining planetary positions]
tycho brahe's system earth stationary sun revolves earth other planets revolve sun also directly competed copernicus'
half century later work kepler galileo any substantial evidence defending copernicanism appeared starting time galileo formulated principle inertia
[which] helped explain why everything fall off earth motion

controversy see also catholic church science copernicus astronomer mild controversy immediate result 1543 publication copernicus' book
council trent 1545–63 neither copernicus' theory nor calendar reform later use tables deduced copernicus' calculations discussed
much debated why until six decades after publication de revolutionibus catholic church took any official action against even efforts tolosani going unheeded
catholic side opposition commenced seventy-three years later occasioned galileo
tolosani first notable move against copernicanism magister holy palace
catholic church's chief censor dominican bartolomeo spina expressed desire stamp out copernican doctrine
spina's death 1546 cause fell friend well known theologian-astronomer dominican giovanni maria tolosani convent st
mark florence
tolosani written treatise reforming calendar astronomy play large role attended fifth lateran council 1512–17 discuss matter
obtained copy de revolutionibus 1544
denunciation copernicanism written year later 1545 appendix unpublished work truth sacred scripture
emulating rationalistic style thomas aquinas tolosani sought refute copernicanism philosophical argument
copernicanism absurd according tolosani because scientifically unproven unfounded
first copernicus assumed motion earth offered no physical theory whereby deduce motion
no realized investigation copernicanism result rethinking entire field physics
second tolosani charged copernicus' thought process backwards
held copernicus come up idea then sought phenomena support rather observing phenomena deducing them idea caused them
tolosani linking copernicus' mathematical equations practices pythagoreans whom aristotle made arguments against later picked up thomas aquinas
argued mathematical numbers mere product intellect without any physical reality such provide physical causes investigation nature
astronomical hypotheses time such epicycles eccentrics seen mere mathematical devices adjust calculations heavenly bodies appear rather explanation cause those motions
copernicus still maintained idea perfectly spherical orbits relied epicycles
saving phenomena seen proof astronomy mathematics taken serious means determine physical causes
tolosani invoked view final critique copernicus saying biggest error started inferior fields science make pronouncements superior fields
copernicus used mathematics astronomy postulate physics cosmology rather beginning accepted principles physics cosmology determine things astronomy mathematics
thus copernicus seemed undermining whole system philosophy science time
tolosani held copernicus fallen philosophical error because versed physics logic anyone without such knowledge make poor astronomer unable distinguish truth falsehood
because copernicanism met criteria scientific truth set out thomas aquinas tolosani held viewed wild unproven theory
ptolemy copernicus ca
1686 king jan sobieski's library wilanów palace early copernicus depiction tolosani recognized ad lectorem preface copernicus' book actually
thesis astronomy whole never able make truth claims rejected tolosani though still held copernicus' attempt describe physical reality faulty found ridiculous ad lectorem included book unaware copernicus authorized inclusion
tolosani means these words [of ad lectorem] foolishness book's author rebuked
foolish effort [copernicus] tried revive weak pythagorean opinion [that element fire center universe] long ago deservedly destroyed since expressly contrary human reason also opposes holy writ
situation there easily arise disagreements catholic expositors holy scripture those might wish adhere obstinately false opinion
tolosani declared nicolaus copernicus neither read nor understood arguments aristotle philosopher ptolemy astronomer
tolosani copernicus expert indeed sciences mathematics astronomy very deficient sciences physics logic
moreover appears unskilled regard [the interpretation of] holy scripture since contradicts several principles without danger infidelity himself readers book
arguments no force very easily taken apart
stupid contradict opinion accepted everyone over very long time strongest reasons unless impugner uses powerful insoluble demonstrations completely dissolves opposed reasons
does least
tolosani declared written against copernicus purpose preserving truth common advantage holy church
despite work remained unpublished there no evidence received serious consideration
robert westman describes becoming dormant viewpoint no audience catholic world late sixteenth century also notes there evidence become known tommaso caccini criticize galileo sermon december 1613
theology tolosani may criticized copernican theory scientifically unproven unfounded theory also conflicted theology time seen sample works john calvin
commentary genesis indeed ignorant circuit heavens finite earth like little globe placed centre
commentary psalms 931 states heavens revolve daily immense their fabric inconceivable rapidity their revolutions experience no concussion
how earth hang suspended air upheld god's hand? means maintain itself unmoved while heavens above constant rapid motion divine maker fix establish
sharp point conflict copernicus' theory bible concerned story battle gibeon book joshua hebrew forces winning whose opponents likely escape once night fell
averted joshua's prayers causing sun moon stand still
martin luther once made remark copernicus although without mentioning name
according anthony lauterbach while eating martin luther topic copernicus arose during dinner 4 june 1539 same year professor george joachim rheticus local university granted leave visit
luther remarked goes now
whoever wants clever must agree nothing others esteem
must something own
fellow does wishes turn whole astronomy upside down
even these things thrown disorder believe holy scriptures joshua commanded sun stand still earth
these remarks made four years before publication revolutions heavenly spheres year before rheticus' narratio prima
john aurifaber's account conversation luther calls copernicus fool rather fellow version viewed historians less reliably sourced
luther's collaborator philipp melanchthon also took issue copernicanism
after receiving first pages narratio prima rheticus himself melanchthon mithobius physician mathematician burkard mithob feldkirch 16 october 1541 condemning theory calling repressed governmental force writing certain people believe marvelous achievement extol crazy thing like polish astronomer makes earth move sun stand still
really wise governments ought repress impudence mind
appeared rheticus melanchton understand theory open
because melanchton taught ptolemaic astronomy even recommended friend rheticus appointment deanship faculty arts & sciences university wittenberg after returned studying copernicus
rheticus' hopes dashed six years after publication de revolutionibus melanchthon published initia doctrinae physicae presenting three grounds reject copernicanism
these evidence senses thousand-year consensus men science authority bible
blasting new theory melanchthon out love novelty order make show their cleverness people argued earth moves
maintain neither eighth sphere nor sun moves whereas attribute motion other celestial spheres also place earth among heavenly bodies
nor these jokes invented recently
there still extant archimedes' book sand-reckoner reports aristarchus samos propounded paradox sun stands still earth revolves around sun
even though subtle experts institute many investigations sake exercising their ingenuity nevertheless public proclamation absurd opinions indecent sets harmful example
melanchthon went cite bible passages then declare encouraged divine evidence let us cherish truth let us permit ourselves alienated tricks those deem intellectual honor introduce confusion arts
first edition initia doctrinae physicae melanchthon even questioned copernicus' character claiming motivation either love novelty desire appear clever these personal attacks largely removed second edition 1550
another protestant theologian took issue copernicus john owen declared late hypothesis fixing sun centre world' 'built fallible phenomena advanced many arbitrary presumptions against evident testimonies scripture
roman catholic circles german jesuit nicolaus serarius first write against copernicus' theory heretical citing joshua passage work published 1609–1610 again book 1612
12 april 1615 letter catholic defender copernicus paolo antonio foscarini catholic cardinal robert bellarmine condemned copernican theory writing
holy fathers also modern commentaries genesis psalms ecclesiastes joshua you will find agreeing literal interpretation sun heaven turns around earth great speed earth very far heaven sits motionless center world
nor answer matter faith since matter faith 'as regards topic' matter faith 'as regards speaker' heretical say abraham two children jacob twelve well say christ born virgin because both holy spirit through mouth prophets apostles
ingoli perhaps most influential opponent copernican theory francesco ingoli catholic priest
ingoli january 1616 essay galileo presenting twenty arguments against copernican theory
though certain probable [ingoli] commissioned inquisition write expert opinion controversy after congregation index's decree against copernicanism 5 march 1616 ingoli officially appointed consultant
galileo himself opinion essay played important role rejection theory church authorities writing later letter ingoli concerned people thought theory rejected because ingoli right
ingoli presented five physical arguments against theory thirteen mathematical arguments plus separate discussion sizes stars four theological arguments
physical mathematical arguments uneven quality many them came directly writings tycho brahe ingoli repeatedly cited brahe leading astronomer era
these included arguments effect moving earth trajectory projectiles parallax brahe's argument copernican theory required stars absurdly large
two ingoli's theological issues copernican theory common catholic beliefs directly traceable scripture doctrine hell located center earth most distant heaven explicit assertion earth motionless hymn sung tuesdays part liturgy hours divine office prayers regularly recited priests
ingoli cited robert bellarmine regards both these arguments may trying convey galileo sense bellarmine's opinion
ingoli also cited genesis 114 god places lights firmament heavens divide day night
ingoli think central location sun copernican theory compatible being described lights placed firmament
like previous commentators ingoli also pointed passages battle gibeon
dismissed arguments should taken metaphorically saying replies assert scripture speaks according our mode understanding satisfactory both because explaining sacred writings rule preserve literal sense possible case also because [church] fathers unanimously take passage mean sun truly moving stopped joshua's request
interpretation contrary unanimous consent fathers condemned council trent session iv decree edition use sacred books
furthermore although council speaks matters faith morals nevertheless cannot denied holy fathers displeased interpretation sacred scriptures contrary their common agreement
however ingoli closed essay suggesting galileo respond primarily better physical mathematical arguments rather theological arguments writing let your choice respond either entirely part—clearly least mathematical physical arguments even these weighty ones
galileo letter reply ingoli years later fact addressed mathematical physical arguments
march 1616 connection galileo affair roman catholic church's congregation index issued decree suspending de revolutionibus until corrected grounds ensuring copernicanism described false pythagorean doctrine altogether contrary holy scripture creep any further prejudice catholic truth
corrections consisted largely removing altering wording spoke heliocentrism fact rather hypothesis
corrections made based largely work ingoli
galileo orders pope paul v cardinal robert bellarmine gave galileo prior notice decree issued warned hold defend copernican doctrine
[i] corrections de revolutionibus omitted altered nine sentences issued four years later 1620
1633 galileo galilei convicted grave suspicion heresy following position copernicus contrary true sense authority holy scripture placed under house arrest rest life
instance roger boscovich catholic church's 1758 index prohibited books omitted general prohibition works defending heliocentrism retained specific prohibitions original uncensored versions de revolutionibus galileo's dialogue concerning two chief world systems
