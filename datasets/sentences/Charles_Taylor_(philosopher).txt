essay follow rule taylor explores why people fail follow rules kind knowledge allows person successfully follow rule such arrow sign
intellectualist tradition presupposes follow directions must know set propositions premises how follow directions
taylor argues wittgenstein's solution interpretation rules draws upon tacit background
background rules premises wittgenstein calls forms life
specifically wittgenstein says philosophical investigations obeying rule practice
taylor situates interpretation rules within practices incorporated our bodies form habits dispositions tendencies
following heidegger merleau-ponty hans-georg gadamer michael polanyi wittgenstein taylor argues mistaken presuppose our understanding world primarily mediated representations
against unarticulated background representations make sense us
occasion follow rules explicitly representing them ourselves taylor reminds us rules contain principles their own application application requires draw unarticulated understanding sense things—the background
taylor's critique naturalism taylor defines naturalism family various often quite diverse theories hold ambition model study man natural sciences
philosophically naturalism largely popularized defended unity science movement advanced logical positivist philosophy
many ways taylor's early philosophy springs critical reaction against logical positivism naturalism ascendant oxford while student
initially much taylor's philosophical work consisted careful conceptual critiques various naturalist research programs
began 1964 dissertation explanation behaviour detailed systematic criticism behaviourist psychology
skinner highly influential mid-century
there taylor also spread critique other disciplines
still hugely influential essay interpretation sciences man published 1972 critique political science behavioural revolution advanced giants field like david easton robert dahl gabriel almond sydney verba
essay entitled signiﬁcance signiﬁcance case cognitive psychology taylor criticized naturalism saw distorting major research program replaced
skinner's behaviourism
taylor also detected naturalism fields immediately apparent
example 1978's language human nature found naturalist distortions various modern designative theories language while sources self 1989 found both naturalist error deep moral motivational sources outlook various individualist utilitarian conceptions selfhood
taylor hermeneutics concurrent taylor's critique naturalism development alternative
indeed taylor's mature philosophy begins doctoral student oxford turned away disappointed analytic philosophy search other philosophical resources found french german hermeneutics phenomenology
hermeneutic tradition develops view human understanding cognition centred decipherment meanings opposed say foundational theories brute verification apodictic rationalism
taylor's own philosophical outlook broadly fairly characterized hermeneutic
clear championing works major figures within hermeneutic tradition such wilhelm dilthey heidegger merleau ponty gadamer
also evident own original contributions hermeneutic interpretive theory
communitarian critique liberalism taylor well alasdair mac intyre michael walzer michael sandel associated communitarian critique liberal theory's understanding self
communitarians emphasize importance social institutions development individual meaning identity
massey lecture malaise modernity taylor argued political theorists—from john locke thomas hobbes john rawls ronald dworkin—have neglected way individuals arise within context supplied societies
realistic understanding self recognizes social background against life choices gain importance meaning
philosophy sociology religion further information secular age taylor's later work turned philosophy religion evident several pieces including lecture catholic modernity short monograph varieties religion today william james revisited
taylor's most significant contribution field date book secular age argues against secularization thesis max weber steve bruce others
rough form secularization thesis holds modernity bundle phenomena including science technology rational forms authority progresses religion gradually diminishes influence
taylor begins fact modern world seen disappearance religion rather diversification many places growth
then develops complex alternative notion secularization actually means given secularization thesis borne out
process taylor also greatly deepens account moral political spiritual modernity begun sources self
