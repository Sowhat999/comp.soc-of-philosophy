while orthodox marxist view ideology held cultural superstructure completely determined economic base western marxists critically analyzed culture historical social phenomenon alongside economic production distribution political power relationships
held culture must studied using hegelian concept immanent critique theory adequate description criticism philosophical cultural text must carried out same terms text itself employs order develop internal inconsistencies manner allows intellectual advancement
marx highlighted immanent critique early writings derived hegel's development new form dialectical thinking attempt jameson comments lift itself mightily up own bootstraps
narrative history history came play increasingly central role jameson's interpretation both reading consumption writing production literary texts
