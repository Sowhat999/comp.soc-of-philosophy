nietzsche claimed wagner's art germanic closer italy's roman catholicism

also embarked critique nietzsche lifelong critic christianity christian morality
drews reproached nietzsche being apostle unbridled individualism — stance put drews awkward position german establishment
criticisms never well received academics nor german society whole since nietzsche become national figure
1904 drews gave critical lecture münich philosophy nietzsche nietzsches philosophie
[nietzsche] aiming bypassing morality such external morality imposes commandments individual results decay submission self
like counter old morality enemy self new morality springing individual will conformity nature
[emphasis added] drews continued philosophical critique nietzsche nietzsche als antipode wagners 1919 [nietzsche antipodes wagner]
1931 book wagner came out supplement nietzsche wagner bernhard hoffers asserted many drews' views later borrowed standard scholarship wagner without giving credit
[citation needed] drews delivered last public critique nietzsche article nietzsche als philosoph des nationalsozialismus? [nietzsche philosopher national socialism?] journal nordische stimmen no

there drews again attacked nietzsche philosophical grounds direct opposition nazi effort enlist nietzsche propaganda unconcerned potential consequences
wolfang müller-lauter experiences nietzsche quotes drews finds nietzsche neither national sympathy nor social awareness [drews claimed]
nietzsche contrary particularly after break richard wagner enemy everything german supports creation “good european” goes far accord jews leading role dissolution nations
finally individualist no notion “the national socialist credo ‘collective over individual utility’
after must seem unbelievable nietzsche honored philosopher national socialism … preaches things opposite national socialism” setting aside few scattered utterances
fact such honors repeatedly bestowed main reason most people talk nietzsche tend pick ‘raisins' cake philosophy because aphoristic style lack any clear understanding way entire thought coheres
[emphasis added] drews's views religion arthur drews karlsruhe eduard von hartmann drews unsatisfied abstract rationality kantian philosophy attracted religion put off regarded spiritual dryness geistige dürre christianity
drews found anchor monism eduard von hartmann 1842–1906 professor philosophy berlin
hartmann strongly influenced schopenhauer pessimism embraced darwinism history
hartmann published work philosophy unconscious 1869
concept unconscious mind das unbewusstsein became new form ultimate reality absolute geist world spirit hegel combining pantheism rational idealism double attributes will reason
view human mind separate unconscious reality exists approaches self-consciousness selbstbewusstsein especially opinion philosophical community
drews expanded views die religion als selbst-bewusstsein gottes eine philosophische untersuchung über das wesen religion religion self-consciousness god philosophical inquiry essence religion 1906
text expressed religions conscious expressions unconscious philosophy religion finally united
absolute spirit another separate entity hartmann drews rejected idea any personal god mind-matter dualism
christ myth ii drews specified motivation chief danger come our time especially religion under influence science denial objective purpose universe
let men taught believe again ideas then monism idealistic form will become first principle deep religious life
[emphasis added] drews goes proclaim need religion future concrete monism
advocacy system monism became drews's life program subject philosophical religious writings
also motivation social activism free religion movement sprouting cultural associations kulturbünde germany especially search new religion anchored european specifically german culture
both hartmann drews shared infatuation history belief direction history transmuted philosophical axiom hegel applied history religion mythology
influence albert kalthoff bauer drews derived additional key ideas albert kalthoff 1850–1906
kalthoff active minister managed marry three times short life revived bruno bauer's christ myth thesis das christus-problem
grundlinien zu einer sozialtheologie problem christ principles social theology 1902 die entstehung des christentums neue beiträge zum christusproblem rise christianity 1907
kalthoff criticized regarded romanticist sentimental image jesus great personality history developed german liberal theologians including albert schweitzer
kalthoff's views early church created new testament reverse early jesus movement socialist expecting social reform better world fused jewish apocalyptic belief messiah
kalthoff saw christianity social psychosis
[citation needed] drews accepted kalthoff's ideas insisted original christian socialism religious economic
critique liberal theology drews become acerbic critic called faulty historical method academic liberal theologians
primary critique judaism christianity ancient archaic myths antiquity become obsolete their concepts [are] foreign our mindsets modern scientific age
opposed romanticist cult personality applied jesus referred christ myth
rejected attempt liberal theologians like albert schweitzer idolize historical jesus unique personality asserted result great man theory subjected modern manipulations scholars historical theology school
view already advanced schweitzer himself review historical criticism germany book quest historical jesus 1906
die religion als selbst-bewusstsein gottes eine philosophische untersuchung über das wesen religion religion self-consciousness god philosophical inquiry essence religion 1906 drews saw phenomenon religion through philosophical approach self-consciousness god through mind mankind

matters religion belief many generations proves nothing their own credulity
great error propagated easily great truth because easier believe reflect men prefer wonders romance plain facts history
might urge against christians faith any people miracles oracles religion proved truth doubt admit argument will same theirs
know will say alone truth other people say same
[the christ cult replaced mithras cult reasons other force personality]
persian mithra very shadowy form beside jesus came nearer heart especially women invalids weak human features account touching description death
shows most concrete idea better prospect triumphing spiritual struggle abstract proves nothing regards historical reality idea
moreover history teaches us quite different causes—partly external accidental causes political nature such death persian war emperor julian most zealous followers mithra—that gave christianity victory over mithraism

14 witness gospels part iv christ myth ii
drews asserted mankind cannot let present still shackled called past superstitions ancient times
outlined called religion future must acknowledge world-spirit geist proclaimed hegel god-mankind god manifesting himself through history human actors oracles merely major agents
cult great personalities dismissed illusion individuals no longer seen godmen just revealers oracles divinity
purely historical conception jesus cannot satisfy religious consciousness our age
[it is] obsolete
[humanity] merely broken geocentric anthropocentric view origin christianity seen through superstitious nature ecclesiastical christology
modern humanity therefore task again universalising idea divine redemption enlarging idea god-man
idea god-humanity
[it] returns certain sense pre-christian religion numerous “god-men”
filled idea reality spiritual nature various individuals related modi phenomena or'revelations confiding divine control world therefore rationality goodness
thus man secures faith himself divine nature being rationality existence thus placed position save himself without mediator simply account own divine nature
religion future will either belief divine nature self will nothing
no christ needed there no ground concern religion may perish denial historicity jesus
[the belief christ] superfluous mischievous
loads religious consciousness doubtful historical ballast grants past authority over religious life present prevents men deducing real consequences their monistic religious principles
hence insist belief historical reality jesus chief obstacle religious progress
[no need appeal hegel] whom high appreciation present above history may traced well vindication “personalities world-history
great personality clearly value even our own view unity god man god-mankind attains clearer expression
serves proof religious consciousness god raises up right man right time
reveals living connection common individual life universal spiritual life
divinity lives history reveals itself therein
history union nature sole place divine activity
continuous stream divine activity flows through time
bind up religion history modern theologians represent historical religion need modern man no proof insight determination
recognise christian religion alone
studies monism drews believed religion intimately linked prevalent beliefs social group just expression individual beliefs faith
reflected history great faiths world european history 19 th century nationalism
own mysticism modern form monism glamorized german idealism great german thinkers poets superior form future religion mankind
also related spinoza's pantheism also rejected judaism christianity ancient superstition no longer valid rationalism our modern times
drews especially drawn plotinus founded neoplatonism 600 years after time plato
year later drews edited monismus dargestellt beiträgen seiner vertreter analyzes major philosophers monism
1913 published history monism antiquity 1912 throughout various schools hellenistic philosophy
drews thus managed produce modern system philosophy joining ancient idealism monism plotinus's neoplatonism modern historical idealism hegel whom world-spirit manifests itself history
towards end life drews started writing explicitly idea monist god means context modern germany 1930 s
god 1930 word god 1933 demonstrated trend towards german-inspired form religion
astromythical views related early christianity drews intrigued alleged influence ancient astronomy origins religion developed french volney dupuis[clarification needed] promoted throughout 19 th century

other books early christianity drews also few books various aspects christianity systematically analyzes regarded mythical nature personages involved jesus christ
klaus schilling english summary denial historicity jesus past present drews involved too deep subject stop there went boldly further exploring how christianity become world religion without historical founder core group described scripture
during [first world] war schweitzer published essays weak attempt justify theology strengthened drews' attitude endeavor
[emphasis added] legend peter 1910 translated english 1997 frank zindler drews complains confusion educated circles
great posture rome impudent exposes completely legendary character figure peter both gospels fantastical history peter rome
according drews klaus schilling's english summary denial historicity jesus gospel poetic retelling astral mythical journey sun god dressed tanakh pictures
order tales follows almost strictly astral mythical cycle
mark's gospel astral magical gnostic origin middle second century
drews published introduction astral mythology cultures mediterranean iranian region up imperial times order decrease above ignorance
theologians continued indulge their self-induced ignorance
[emphasis added] 1924 book origin christianity gnosticism drews developed hypothesis derivation christianity gnosticism environment
drews's own words klaus schilling's english summary denial historicity jesus gnosticism undeniably pre-christian both jewish gentile roots
wisdom solomon already contained gnostic elements prototypes jesus gospels
god stops being lord righteous deed becomes good
clear pre-christian gnosticism distilled epistles paul
paul recklessly misunderstood those try read anything historical jesus-ish
conversion paul acts apostles mere forgery various tanakh passages
[the epistles] christian mystics middle second century
paul thus strongest witness against historical jesus hypothesis
john's gnostic origin evident synoptics
acceptance proves even church wasn't concerned historical facts
[emphasis added] myth mary 1928 reads jesus's family entourage exposed drews asserted characters around jesus imaginary fantastic jesus himself

drews's concerns restoring authenticity religion mankind
both william benjamin smith arthur drews denied historicity jesus christ unlike most exponents myth thesis dedicated theists thought purging religion legendary accretions providing important cleanup service equipping tools efficiently withstand onslaught modern materialism
drews felt urgent need reform structure established religion free attachment primitive features early mythical christianity
christ myth ii glorifies greatness german mind complains how then asked admit salvation modern times depends belief churches degenerated stupid superstition?
why then should compelled take our religious possessions past?
ideas remote age degenerate culture keep us under their power ever? drews's books released during phase profound turmoil germany restructuring religious scene
repeatedly drews came back same theme reform started thinking nature religion future
free religion movement drews those scholars intellectuals averse bringing their ideas public especially case cause countering influence christian churches
religious activist willing descend public forum stand up views harangue crowds
concern renewal religion drews's preoccupation life along many other germans
germany going through craze forming kinds associations matters public concern including religion
alongside established churches germany seen few important movements emerge liberated attitude towards religion
1859 german association free religion societies bund freireligiöser gemeinden deutschlands founded
followed 1881 german association freethinkers deutscher freidenkerbund 1906 german association monists deutscher monistenbund
drews threw lot both free religion association monist association part free religion movement freireligiöse bewegung

romantic nordic mysticism become prevalent fascination among 19 th-century german elite such richard wagner contemporary artists historians writers
unavoidably aroused drews' attention old teutonic beliefs much vogue northern europe
drews seen early christianity religion promise rebirth transfiguration defeated oppressed country announcing coming kingdom god creation national myth giving hope ancient occupied palestinian jews expectation messianic leader liberator
jews expecting palestine going go through own course death rebirth
during rise germany nazi party included ideology old teutonic mysticism highly educated artistic literary elite propaganda vulgarized crude popular mass mythology germanic aryan superiority quasi-religious overtones encouraging fringe development came called germanic neopaganism
aging close death drews struck theoretical parallel early christianity modern national socialist mysticism promise national rebirth transfiguration oppressed state ofrenewed hope defeated country under leadership new charismatic liberator resonated own concept future religion based german monist idealism
german nationalism repudiation christianity national socialist party's propaganda overwhelming country drews's language last theological writings became increasingly focused concepts glorified germanness opposition people ancient near east whose cultures given rise greco-roman classicism including drews' beloved plotinus also christianity — now devalued labeled foreign races

new religious group became active 1934
hauer's ambition use reventlow's nsdap connections engineer unification free religion movement völkish movement

new group's political objectives dreams becoming state religion clashed basic program free religion societies pursuing limited interests freer religion
addition racism antisemitism become overt nsdap's national policy after reached political power became also quickly apparent major goal hauer reventlow

movement never achieved status small esoteric fringe group
never managed dent let alone replace christianity land martin luther
turned out merely cultural flash-in-the-pan curiosity complex landscape germany's religious life mid '30 s
nsdap government changed name 1938 jettisoned nuisance incapable displacing two strong christian churches germany risked alienate them against new regime
spite drews' hope promote new religion based idealistic monism pantheism distinct german character participation karlsruhe free religion society hauer's effort unify provincial free religion associations völkish movement short-lived produced no results
drews elitist thinker hegel hartmann tradition advocate unconscious world spirit being fundamental engine religion acting history through agents oracles
remained hostile any religion based historic personality cult late life confronted practical difficulty translating lofty ambitions simpler drives requirements mass movement
german religion drews life opposed any cult historical personality
major criticisms christianity
unconscious world-spirit larger any individual — felt great personalities godly simply agents expressions
similarly no modern form religion based cult contemporary leader even though tendency nsdap ideology
nsdap never went way didn't try impose new religion displace christianity still strong force germany partly accepted new nazi leadership

tried adjust lifelong beliefs idealistic monism perspective new social situation germany
philosopher's conscience move flow unconscious world spirit
drews's book included catalogue nazi collection research resources ball state university library
citation book describes work 'new' german religion mixes faith nazi mysticism
description likely entered collector painted drews's book nazi ideology brush reflects popular misconception scholarly justified does reflect 1935 german text
drews faith meant faith unconscious world-spirit divine manifested history through human consciousness nazi mysticism based cult personality mythical historical — zeus mithras jesus christ napoleon führer — primary kind mysticism drews dismissed caricature religion
drews endeavored stress potential development own idealistic kind monist religion form free religion nationalistic german character
never become nazi party activist
very brief involvement before death 1935 aborted attempt southwest association free religion join brand-new venture called german faith movement misinterpreted having lent support early attempts unite various german pagan organizations unified body description tended make drews wrongly appear promoter old teutonic values neopaganism complete opposition lifelong beliefs idealism monism
critics drews like present much simplified distorted version events last two years unable unwilling understand motivations ambitions
forget mention drews free religion colleagues abandoned german faith movement anddissociated themselves hauer reventlow soon became clear two leaders' ambition much political religious
drews interested old mythical values
put last ounces energy just before death writing theoretical treatise repeat old message urging renewal religion future time pronounced german character still anchored german idealism promoting ever since youthful infatuation eduard von hartmann
against anti-semitism among many reservations german faith movement reason abandoning drews others perceived blatant antisemitism
drews objected racist assumption antisemitism article jesus aryan jesus arier 1934 paid homage courage moral fiber jews through history ancient hebrew prophets transformed primitive god wrath god mercy psalms proverbs wisdom books [drews denies that] jew cannot driven liberty courage
[drews mentioned the] fights freedom maccabees fatal defense jerusalem against romans last desperate fight jews bar kokhba wars [the third last jewish war against roman army led final destruction jewish state palestine]
[in same vein drews referred courage those] poor jews medieval ghetto preferred endure thousand dead rather renounce their faith climbed still self-controlled stakes

[who] never feared jail exile death
[in course progress jewish religion] desert god yahweh old testament become larger tolerant humane friendly
[so that] angry authoritarian god changed merciful god goodness love god psalms proverbs wisdom writings

able deliver tribute jewish faith hand brought light differences free religion also showed respect people other thoughts
death drews died 19 july 1935 illenau achern near bühl baden age 70
re-evaluation drews bernhard hoffers germany struggling legacy nazi era still process rehabilitating exceptional scholars
bernhardt hoffers 2003 biographical eulogy took up challenge restoring drews's reputation felt unfairly tarnished
stressed following facts highlighted drews during life irritant continually encroaching turf many specialists german universities theology philology astronomy mythology music criticism psychology
specialists didn't welcome interference even resented outsider
drews regarded maverick philosophy stood outside academia didn't accept dilettantism abweichungen von communis opinio
hartmann vogue either drews' dependence old professor another hindrance
drews created no school no followers germany
remain teacher technische hochschule karlsruhe rest life
drews' support wagner opposition nietzsche nothing improve standing
met studied indifference [das ignorieren] silence [das totschweigen] academic pundits while international public popularity press coverage increasing
even university karlsruhe very town lived taught didn't want mention name
treatment hands academics similar those william
smith us john m
robertson later george
wells england paul-louis couchoud france
after death name largely forgotten
mentioned german media mostly having advocated need religion renewal literature wagner nietzsche
work omitted grossly misrepresented discredited major german reference books
books germany now hard find
however book plotinus still demand christ myth widely available english-speaking world hermann detering radikalkritik continues make denial historicity jesus still available
drews fighting life acceptance recognition germany tenure university
spite enormous scholarly output popularity never able obtain university position
understand why end life drews expressing hope renewal germany
hoffers sake fairness remarked drews never member nazi party spoke out early against growing antisemitism 1920 s
never involved any action against jewish intellectuals artists academics
whereas instance philosopher like heidegger visibly active nazi movement rüdiger safranski described detail martin heidegger good evil 1999
hoffers emphasized scholar drews objective honest’‘
spite scholarly differences maintained friendship schweitzer while
polyglot collected japanese art prints
gifted energetic man tremendous capacity work
gained esteem van den bergh van eysinga leader dutch radical school viewed good guy ein netter kerl
conclusion hoffers urged scholars renew acquaintance drews' books
claiming arguments developed work outmoded refuted [überholt] unjustified
parting shot hoffers asks pertinent question really true question jesus's historicity absolutely clarified moreover uninteresting heard discussions theologians? ist es wirklich dass die frage nach historizität jesu absolut geklärt und obendrein noch nebensächlich ist wie man gesprächen mit theologen zu hören bekommt?
