philosophy many respects identical pupil epictetus marked strong practical tendency
philosophy everyone cultivate mere matter words instruction school everyone own reflection practice may pursue himself
still considers becoming philosopher wear philosopher's robe allow hair grow retire general society
same time convinced power philosophy over minds people hopes heal corruption human mind
philosophy consists entirely rules conduct life knowledge ought serviceable action
does reject logic regards proof weak mind decline examine fallacy perplexes yet same time expresses disgust multitude dogmas fed vanity sophists
gives little attention physical doctrines stoics asserts gods know things without need reasoning since them nothing obscure unknown
human soul considers akin gods agrees other stoics soul material after being corrupted bodily influence may again purified cleansed
strongly asserts liberty rational soul greek διάνοια
musonius pays much attention ethics logic physics holds philosophy nothing else investigation practice becoming obligatory philosophy says merely pursuit virtuous life
requires people both men women should cultivate philosophy sure road virtue
agrees easy follow one's own nature great impediment find truly moral life prejudices mind filled childhood evil habits confirmed practices
thus regards philosophy mental art healing lays great stress practice virtue preferring practice precept
distinguishes two kinds practice exercise mind reflection adoption good rules life endurance bodily pains affect both soul body
life lived according nature consists social friendly sentiments temper contentment will simply alleviate primary needs nature
combats selfishness regards marriage merely becoming natural principle family state preservation whole human race
zealously protests against exposure children unnatural custom every opportunity recommends practice benevolence
precepts simple life carefully detailed gives precise regulations diet care body clothing even furniture
thus recommends hair should allowed grow long cut too close honours beard basis hair provided nature covering body
forbids meat prefers food furnished offered nature requires art cooking
musonius argued because men's women's capacity understand virtue same both should trained philosophy
