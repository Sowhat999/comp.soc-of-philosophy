philoponus studied school alexandria began publishing 510
pupil sometime amanuensis neoplatonic philosopher ammonius hermiae studied athens under proclus
philoponus’ early writings based lectures given ammonius gradually established own independent thinking commentaries critiques aristotle's soul physics
latter work philoponus became earliest thinkers reject aristotle's dynamics propose theory impetus
object moves continues move because energy imparted mover ceases movement energy exhausted
insightful theory first step towards concept inertia modern physics although philoponus’ theory largely ignored time because too radical rejection aristotle
[view aristotle] completely erroneous our view may completely corroborated actual observation effectively any sort verbal argument
you let fall same height two weights many times heavier other you will see ratio times required motion does depend [solely] weights difference time very small
— john philoponus' refutation aristotelian claim elapsed time falling body inversely proportional weight philoponus writer antiquity such concept formally presented
discovery principle inertia hallmark achievement modern science emerges 16 th 17 th centuries pierre duhem argues invention put philoponus among great geniuses antiquity principal precursors modern science although holds likely philoponus may received idea earlier otherwise unrecorded alexandrian school mechanics
529 philoponus critique against proclus systematically defeats every argument put forward eternity world theory formed basis pagan attack christian doctrine creation
intellectual battle against eternalism became philoponus' major preoccupations dominated several publications now lost over following decade
introduced new period scientific thought based heavily three premises universe product single god 2 heavens earth same physical properties 3 stars divine
these principles philoponus went after rival simplicius cilicia questioning aristotle's' view dynamics cosmology
argued motion occur void velocity falling object based weight
also held god created matter physical properties natural laws allow matter progress state chaos organized state forming present universe
remains writings indicate used same didactic methods reasoning modern science uses performed genuine experiments
style commentaries conclusions made philoponus unpopular colleagues fellow philosophers appears ceased study philosophy around 530 devoting himself theology instead
around 550 theological work creation world commentary bible’s story creation using insights greek philosophers basil great
work transfers theory impetus motion planets whereas aristotle proposed different explanations motion heavenly bodies earthly projectiles
thus philoponus’ theological work recognized history science first attempt unified theory dynamics

philosophical commentaries commentaries late antiquity early middle ages aimed teach audience
regard repetitive nature philoponus’ commentaries demonstrates pedagogical awareness
although abstract manner philoponus chiefly focused concept question
most philoponus’ early philosophical works strive define distinction matter extension place various kinds change
example commentary against aristotle eternity world represents standardized description aristotelian natural philosophy
both aristotle philoponus argue kinds change there differences their form matter
physics aristotle operates idea places dismisses existence space
idea came plato developed aristotle evolved philoponus
philoponus attempts combine idea homogeneous space aristotelian system
argument made philoponus substances themselves require determinate quantity their being
similarly aristotle rejected immaterial thingsand contrast plato whose metaphysics accepted immaterial substances philoponus’ concept substance refers material objects
concerning discussion space philoponus’ claim every point space possible draw identical figures made perceived innovative thinker influenced later renaissance scholars instance gianfranceso pico della mirandola galileo galilei
thus philoponus' idea perspective signifies concept space immaterial three-dimensional medium objects located
third book de anima entitled de intellectu philoponus analyzes doctrine intellect
author philoponus pseudo-philoponus? sets theory role functioning active intellect
hand there active intellect other idea perception awareness how aware perceiving
other words reflective philosophy there rationalist conclusion emphasizes relation self truth leads discussion nature knowledge
according view knowledge identical object since self-awareness perception divorced irrational soul
therefore understanding arises through identification intellect object
specifically perception deals material things
philoponus raised central question scientific philosophical aristotle’s work chemistry
work called generation corruption examines question how mixture chemical combination possible? philoponus’ contribution topic new definition potential third seven elements criteria
there various interpretations theory mixture seems philoponus rather refining aristotle’s approach rejecting
interpreters philophonus’ work theory mixture de haas implies “no element possess quality essential except superlative extent”
theological treatises philoponus’ major christological work arbiter
work written shortly before second council constantinople 553
became famous regard doctrine resurrection
similarly ideas presented physics philoponus work titled arbiter states our corrupted bodies material things will eventually brought being matter form god
