1881 received doctorate thesis kant's philosophy matter part subsequently published nature matter according kant's physical monadology
became privatdozent university berlin 1885 officially lecturing philosophy also ethics logic pessimism art psychology sociology
lectures popular inside university attracted intellectual elite berlin well
although applications vacant chairs german universities supported max weber simmel remained academic outsider
1901 elevated rank extraordinary professor full professor without chair see german section professor
time well known throughout europe america seen man great eminence
well known many articles appeared magazines newspapers
[citation needed] simmel hard time gaining acceptance academic community despite support well known associates such max weber rainer maria rilke stefan george edmund husserl
partly seen jew during era anti-semitism also simply because articles written general audience rather academic sociologists
led dismissive judgements other professionals
simmel nevertheless continued intellectual academic work taking part artistic circles well being cofounder german society sociology together ferdinand tönnies max weber
life meeting point university society arts philosophy possible because heir fortune appointed guardian
1914 simmel received ordinary professorship chair then german university strassburg feel home there
because outbreak world war academic activities lectures halted lecture halls converted military hospitals
1915 applied without success chair university heidelberg
[citation needed] prior outbreak world war simmel very interested contemporary history rather looking interactions art philosophy time
however after start interested unfolding
yet seems give conflicting opinions events being supporter germany's inner transformation objective idea europe critic crisis culture

first assumptions psychological workings social life
second interest sociological workings interpersonal relationships
third work structure changes zeitgeist social cultural “spirit” times
also adopted principle emergence idea higher levels emerge lower levels
finally dealt views nature inevitable fate humanity
most microscopic work dealt forms interaction takes place different types people
forms include subordination superordination exchange conflict sociability
dialectical thinking dialectical approach multicausal multidirectional integrates facts value rejects idea there hard fast dividing lines social phenomena focuses social relations looks present also past future deeply concerned both conflicts contradictions
simmel’s sociology concerned relationships especially interaction known “methodological relationist”
principle everything interacts way everything else
overall mostly interested dualisms conflicts contradictions whatever realm social world happened working
individual consciousness simmel focused forms association paid little attention individual consciousness
simmel believed creative consciousness belief found diverse forms interaction ability actors create social structures disastrous effects those structures creativity individuals
simmel also believed social cultural structures come life their own
sociability simmel refers forms association mere sum separate individuals made 'society' describes higher unity composed individuals
especially fascinated seems impulse sociability man described associations
[through which] solitariness individuals resolved togetherness union others process describes impulse sociability distils out realities social life pure essence association through unity made also refers free-playing interacting interdependence individuals
defines sociability play-form association driven amicability breeding cordiality attractiveness kinds
order free association occur says personalities must emphasize themselves too individually
too much abandon aggressiveness
also describes world sociability
democracy equals
without friction long people blend together spirit fun affection bring among themselves pure interaction free any disturbing material accent
many social interactions entirely sweet character conclude simmel describing somewhat idealised view best types human interaction no means most typical average type
same simmel says vitality real individuals their sensitivities attractions fullness their impulses convictions
symbol life shows itself flow lightly amusing play adds symbolic play whose aesthetic charm finest most highly sublimated dynamics social existence riches gathered
again conclude describing human interactions their idealised best typical ones tend fall long way short descriptions
social geometry dyad triad dyad two-person group triad three-person group
dyad person able retain their individuality
there no other person shift balance group thereby allowing those within dyad maintain their individuality
triad group there possibility dyad forming within triad thereby threatening remaining individual's independence causing them become subordinate group
seems essential part society becomes structure
unfortunately group structure becomes increasingly greater individual becomes separated grows alone isolated segmented
simmel's view somewhat ambiguous respect group size
hand believed bigger group better individual
larger group harder exert control individual other hand large group there possibility individual becoming distant impersonal
therefore effort individual cope larger group must become part smaller group such family
distance value something determined distance actor
stranger simmel discusses how person too close actor considered stranger too far no longer part group
particular distance group allows person objective relationships different group members
simmel metropolis simmel's most notable essays metropolis mental life die großstadt und das geistesleben 1903 originally given series lectures aspects city life experts various fields ranging science religion art
series conducted alongside dresden cities exhibition 1903
simmel originally asked lecture role intellectual scholarly life big city effectively reversed topic order analyze effects big city mind individual
result lectures published essays book fill gap series editor supply essay original topic himself
metropolis mental life particularly well received during simmel's lifetime
organizers exhibition over-emphasized negative comments city life because simmel also pointed out positive transformations
during 1920 s essay influential thinking robert e
park other american sociologists university chicago collectively became known chicago school
gained wider circulation 1950 s translated english published part kurt wolff's edited collection sociology georg simmel
now appears regularly reading lists courses urban studies architecture history
however important note notion blasé actually central final point essay part description sequence states irreversible transformation mind
other words simmel does quite say big city overall negative effect mind self even suggests undergoes permanent changes
perhaps ambiguity gave essay lasting place discourse metropolis
deepest problems modern life flow attempt individual maintain independence individuality existence against sovereign powers society against weight historical heritage external culture technique life
antagonism represents most modern form conflict primitive man must carry nature own bodily existence
eighteenth century may called liberation ties grew up historically politics religion morality economics order permit original natural virtue man equal everyone develop without inhibition nineteenth century may sought promote addition man's freedom individuality connected division labor achievements make unique indispensable same time make much dependent complementary activity others nietzsche may seen relentless struggle individual prerequisite full development while socialism found same thing suppression competition each these same fundamental motive work namely resistance individual being levelled swallowed up social-technological mechanism
— georg simmel metropolis mental life 1903 philosophy money major work simmel saw money component life helped us understand totality life
simmel believed people created value making objects then separating themselves object then trying overcome distance
found things too close considered valuable things too far people get also considered valuable
also considered determining value scarcity time sacrifice difficulties involved getting object
simmel city life leads division labor increased financialization
financial transactions increase emphasis shifts individual instead individual
financial matters play addition emotions
stranger simmel 1914 once again simmel’s concept distance comes play
simmel identifies stranger person far away close same time
stranger close us insofar feel ourselves common features national social occupational generally human nature
far us insofar these common features extend beyond us connect us because connect great many people
— georg simmel stranger 1908 stranger far enough away unknown close enough possible get know
society there must stranger
everyone known then there no person able bring something new everybody
stranger bears certain objectivity makes valuable member individual society
people let down their inhibitions around confess openly without any fear
because there belief stranger connected anyone significant therefore does pose threat confessor's life
generally simmel observes because their peculiar position group strangers often carry out special tasks other members group either incapable unwilling carry out
example especially pre-modern societies most strangers made living trade often viewed unpleasant activity native members those societies
societies also employed arbitrators judges because expected treat rival factions society impartial attitude
objectivity may also defined freedom objective individual bound no commitments prejudice perception understanding evaluation given
— georg simmel stranger 1908 hand stranger's opinion does really matter because lack connection society other stranger’s opinion does matter because lack connection society
holds certain objectivity allows unbiased decide freely without fear
simply able see think decide without being influenced opinion others
simmel secrecy small groups secrets less needed because everyone seems similar
larger groups secrets needed because everyone different
secret society society held together need maintain secret also causes tension because without secret society does exist
even marriage secrecy must exist
revealing marriage becomes dull boring loses excitement
simmel saw general thread importance secrets strategic use ignorance social beings able cope successfully their social environment people need clearly defined realms unknowns themselves
furthermore sharing common secret allows there strong feeling
modern world depends honesty therefore lie considered devastating ever before
money allows there level secrecy never attainable before allows “invisible” transactions because now money such integral part human values beliefs
possible buy silence
simmel flirtation multi-layered essay published 1923 simmel discusses flirtation generalized type sociation interaction
according simmel define flirtation simply 'passion pleasing' confuse means end desire end
distinctiveness flirt lies fact she awakens delight desire means unique antithesis synthesis through alternation accommodation denial
behavior flirt man feels proximity interpenetration ability inability acquire something
essence price
sidelong glance head half-turned characteristic flirtation most banal guise
simmel fashion fashion form social relationship allows those wish conform demands group
also allows individualistic deviating norm
initial stage everyone adopts fashionable those deviate fashion inevitably adopt whole new view consider fashion
ritzer writes simmel argued does following fashion involve dualities does effort part people fashion
unfashionable people view those follow fashion being imitators themselves mavericks simmel argued latter simply engaging inverse form imitation
— george ritzer georg simmel 2008 means those trying different unique because trying different become part new group labeled themselves different unique
