lukács emphasizes concepts such alienation reification class consciousness
lukács argues methodology thing distinguishes marxism even substantive propositions rejected remain valid because distinctive method orthodox marxism therefore does imply uncritical acceptance results marx’s investigations
‘belief’ thesis nor exegesis ‘sacred’ book
contrary orthodoxy refers exclusively method
scientific conviction dialectical materialism road truth methods developed expanded deepened along lines laid down founders
— §1 criticises marxist revisionism calling return marxist method fundamentally dialectical materialism
lukács conceives revisionism inherent marxist theory insofar dialectical materialism according product class struggle reason task orthodox marxism victory over revisionism utopianism never mean defeat once false tendencies
ever-renewed struggle against insidious effects bourgeois ideology thought proletariat
marxist orthodoxy no guardian traditions eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming relation tasks immediate present totality historical process
— end §5 according premise dialectical materialism recall 'it men’s consciousness determines their existence contrary their social existence determines their consciousness
core existence stands revealed social process existence seen product albeit hitherto unconscious product human activity
line marx's thought criticises individualist bourgeois philosophy subject founds itself voluntary conscious subject
against ideology asserts primacy social relations
existence — thus world — product human activity seen primacy social process individual consciousness accepted
lukács does restrain human liberty sociological determinism contrary production existence possibility praxis
conceives problem relationship theory practice
lukács quotes marx's words enough thought should seek realise itself reality must also strive towards thought
how does thought intellectuals related class struggle theory simply lag behind history hegel's philosophy history minerva comes dusk night
? lukács criticises friedrich engels' anti-dühring saying does even mention most vital interaction namely dialectical relation subject object historical process let alone give prominence deserves
dialectical relation subject object basis lukács' critique immanuel kant's epistemology according subject exterior universal contemplating subject separated object
lukács ideology projection class consciousness bourgeoisie functions prevent proletariat attaining consciousness revolutionary position
ideology determines form objectivity thus very structure knowledge
according lukács real science must attain concrete totality through possible think current form objectivity historical period
thus so-called eternal laws economics dismissed ideological illusion projected current form objectivity orthodoxical marxism? §3
also writes core being showed itself social becoming being itself appear product far unconscious human activity activity turn decisive element transformation being

theory novel coins term transcendental homelessness
defining term longing souls place once belonged 'nostalgia… utopian perfection nostalgia feels itself desires true reality'

lifshitz' views very similar lukács far both argued value traditional art

collaboration lifschitz lukács resulted formation informal circle like-minded marxist intellectuals connected journal literaturnyi kritik [the literary critic] published monthly starting summer 1933 organisational committee writers’ union

lukács famously argued revolutionary character novels sir walter scott honoré de balzac
lukács felt both authors' nostalgic pro-aristocratic politics allowed them accurate critical stances because their opposition albeit reactionary rising bourgeoisie
view expressed later book historical novel published russian 1937 then hungarian 1947 well essay realism balance 1938
historical novel probably lukács's most influential work literary history
traces development genre historical fiction
while prior 1789 argues people's consciousness history relatively underdeveloped french revolution napoleonic wars followed brought realisation constantly changing evolving character human existence
new historical consciousness reflected work sir walter scott whose novels use 'representative' 'typical' characters dramatise major social conflicts historical transformations example dissolution feudal society scottish highlands entrenchment mercantile capitalism
lukács argues scott's new brand historical realism taken up balzac tolstoy enabled novelists depict contemporary social life static drama fixed universal types rather moment history constantly changing open potential revolutionary transformation
reason sees these authors progressive their work potentially radical despite their own personal conservative politics
lukács historical realist tradition began give way after 1848 revolutions bourgeoisie ceased progressive force their role agents history usurped proletariat
after time historical realism begins sicken lose concern social life inescapably historical
illustrates point comparing flaubert's historical novel salammbô earlier realists
flaubert's work marks turning away relevant social issues elevation style over substance
why does discuss sentimental education novel much overtly concerned recent historical developments clear

february initial intent realism balance stated outset debunking claims those defending expressionism valuable literary movement
lukács addresses discordance community modernist critics whom regarded incapable deciding writers expressionist arguing perhaps there no such thing expressionist writer
although aim ostensibly criticise perceived over-valuation modernist schools writing time article published lukács uses essay opportunity advance formulation desirable alternative these schools
rejects notion modern art must necessarily manifest itself litany sequential movements beginning naturalism proceeding through impressionism expressionism culminate surrealism
lukács important issue stake conflict results modernists’ evolving oppositions classical forms rather ability art confront objective reality exists world ability found almost entirely lacking modernism
lukács believed desirable alternative such modernism must therefore take form realism enlists realist authors maxim gorky thomas heinrich mann romain rolland champion cause
frame debate lukács introduces arguments critic ernst bloch defender expressionism author whom lukács chiefly responding
maintains modernists such bloch too willing ignore realist tradition ignorance believes derives modernist rejection crucial tenet marxist theory rejection quotes bloch propounding
tenet belief system capitalism objective totality social relations fundamental lukács’ arguments favour realism
explains pervasiveness capitalism unity economic ideological theory profound influence social relations comprise closed integration totality objective whole functions independent human consciousness
lukács cites marx bolster historical materialist worldview relations production every society form whole
further relies marx argue bourgeoisie’s unabated development world’s markets far-reaching create unified totality explains because increasing autonomy elements capitalist system such autonomy currency perceived society crisis there must underlying unity binds these seemingly autonomous elements capitalist system together makes their separation appear crisis
returning modernist forms lukács stipulates such theories disregard relationship literature objective reality favour portrayal subjective experience immediacy little evince underlying capitalist totality existence
clear lukács regards representation reality art’s chief purpose—in perhaps disagreement modernists—but maintains writer strives represent reality truly
authentic realist then question totality plays decisive role
true realists demonstrate importance social context since unmasking objective totality crucial element lukács’ marxist ideology privileges their authorial approach
lukács then sets up dialectical opposition two elements believes inherent human experience
maintains dialectical relation exists appearance events subjective unfettered experiences their essence provoked objective totality capitalism
lukács explains good realists such thomas mann create contrast consciousnesses their characters appearance reality independent them essence
according lukács mann succeeds because creates contrast
conversely modernist writers fail because portray reality appears themselves their characters—subjectively—and fail pierce surface these immediate subjective experiences discover underlying essence
real factors relate their experiences hidden social forces produce them
pitfalls relying immediacy manifold according lukács
because prejudices inculcated capitalist system insidious cannot escaped without abandonment subjective experience immediacy literary sphere
superseded realist authors abandon transcend limits immediacy scrutinising subjective experiences measuring them against social reality no easy task
lukács relies hegelian dialectics explain how relationship immediacy abstraction effects subtle indoctrination part capitalist totality
circulation money explains well other elements capitalism entirely abstracted away place broader capitalist system therefore appears subjective immediacy elides position crucial element objective totality
although abstraction lead concealment objective reality necessary art lukács believes realist authors successfully employ penetrate laws governing objective reality uncover deeper hidden mediated immediately perceptible relationships go make up society
after great deal intellectual effort lukács claims successful realist discover these objective relationships give them artistic shape form character's subjective experience
then employing technique abstraction author portray character’s experience objective reality same kind subjective immediate experience characterise totality’s influence non-fictional individuals
best realists claims depict vital immediately obvious forces work objective reality
such profundity truth products their imagination potentially receive confirmation subsequent historical events
true masterpieces realism appreciated wholes depict wide-ranging exhaustive objective reality like exists non-fictional world
after advancing formulation desirable literary school realism depicts objective reality lukács turns once again proponents modernism
citing nietzsche argues mark every form literary decadence
life no longer dwells totality lukács strives debunk modernist portrayals claiming reflect objective reality instead proceed subjectivity create home-made model contemporary world
abstraction immediacy inherent modernism portrays essences capitalist domination divorced their context way takes each essence isolation rather taking account objective totality foundation them
lukács believes social mission literature clarify experience masses turn show these masses their experiences influenced objective totality capitalism chief criticism modernist schools literature fail live up goal instead proceeding inexorably towards immediate subjective abstracted versions fictional reality ignore objective reality capitalist system
realism because creates apparently subjective experiences demonstrate essential social realities provoke them lukács defensible valuable literary school early twentieth century
