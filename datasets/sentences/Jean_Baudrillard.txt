2004 baudrillard attended major conference work baudrillard arts center art media karlsruhe karlsruhe germany
core ideas baudrillard social theorist critic best known analyses modes mediation technological communication
mostly concerned way technological progress affects social change diverse subjects including consumerism gender relations social history journalistic commentaries aids cloning rushdie affair first gulf war world trade center attacks new york city
published work emerged part generation french thinkers including gilles deleuze jean-françois lyotard michel foucault jacques derrida jacques lacan shared interest semiotics often seen part post-structuralist philosophical school
common many post-structuralists arguments consistently draw upon notion signification meaning both understandable terms how particular words signs interrelate
baudrillard thought many post-structuralists meaning brought through systems signs working together
following structuralist linguist ferdinand de saussure baudrillard argued meaning value created through difference—through something dog means dog because not-cat not-goat not-tree etc
fact viewed meaning near enough self-referential objects images objects words signs situated web meaning object's meaning understandable through relation meaning other objects other words thing's prestige relates another's mundanity
starting point baudrillard theorized broadly human society based upon kind self-referentiality
pictures society portray societies searching sense meaning—or total understanding world—that remains consistently elusive
contrast poststructuralists such michel foucault whom formations knowledge emerge result relations power baudrillard developed theories excessive fruitless search total knowledge leads almost inevitably kind delusion
baudrillard's view human subject may try understand non-human object because object understood according signifies because process signification immediately involves web other signs distinguished never produces desired results
subject rather becomes seduced original latin sense seducere lead away object
therefore argued last analysis complete understanding minutiae human life impossible people seduced thinking otherwise become drawn toward simulated version reality use neologisms state hyperreality
say world becomes unreal rather faster comprehensively societies begin bring reality together supposedly coherent picture insecure unstable looks fearful societies become
reality sense dies out
accordingly baudrillard argued excess signs meaning late 20 th century global society caused quite paradoxically effacement reality
world neither liberal nor marxist utopias any longer believed
live argued global village use marshall mc luhan's phrase rather world ever easily petrified even smallest event
because global world operates level exchange signs commodities becomes ever blind symbolic acts such example terrorism
baudrillard's work symbolic realm develops perspective through anthropological work marcel mauss georges bataille seen quite distinct signs signification
signs exchanged like commodities symbols other hand operate quite differently exchanged like gifts sometimes violently form potlatch
baudrillard particularly later work saw global society without symbolic element therefore symbolically militarily defenseless against acts such rushdie fatwa indeed september terrorist attacks against united states military economic establishment
object value system early books such system objects critique political economy sign consumer society baudrillard's main focus upon consumerism how different objects consumed different ways
time baudrillard's political outlook loosely associated marxism situationism these books differed karl marx significant way
baudrillard situationists consumption rather production main driver capitalist society
baudrillard came conclusion criticising marx's concept use-value
baudrillard thought both marx's adam smith's economic thought accepted idea genuine needs relating genuine uses too easily too simply
baudrillard argued drawing georges bataille needs constructed rather innate
stressed purchases because signify something socially their fetishistic side
objects drawing roland barthes say something their users
why consumption remains important production because ideological genesis needs precedes production goods meet those needs
there four ways object obtaining value
four value-making processes first functional value object instrumental purpose
pen instance writes refrigerator cools
second exchange value object economic value
pen may worth three pencils refrigerator may worth salary earned three months work
third symbolic value object value subject assigns object relation another subject
giver receiver
pen might symbolize student's school graduation gift commencement speaker's gift diamond may symbol publicly declared marital love
last sign value object value within system objects
particular pen may while having no added functional benefit signify prestige relative another pen diamond ring may no function may suggest particular social values such taste class
baudrillard's earlier books attempts argue first two these values simply associated disrupted third particularly fourth
later baudrillard rejected marxism totally mirror production symbolic exchange death
focus difference sign value relates commodity exchange symbolic value relates maussian gift exchange remained work up until death
indeed came play important role particularly writings world events
simulacra simulation main article simulacra simulation developed work throughout 1980 s moved economic theory mediation mass communication
although retaining interest saussurean semiotics logic symbolic exchange influenced anthropologist marcel mauss baudrillard turned attention work marshall mc luhan developing ideas how nature social relations determined forms communication society employs
doing baudrillard progressed beyond both saussure's roland barthes's formal semiology consider implications historically understood version structural semiology
simulation baudrillard claims current stage simulacrum composed references no referents hyperreality
progressing historically renaissance dominant simulacrum form counterfeit—mostly people objects appearing stand real referent instance royalty nobility holiness etc
does exist other words spirit pretense dissimulating others person thing does really it—to industrial revolution dominant simulacrum product series propagated endless production line finally current times dominant simulacrum model nature already stands endless reproducibility itself already reproduced
end history meaning throughout 1980 s 1990 s baudrillard's most common themes historicity specifically how present-day societies utilise notions progress modernity their political choices
argued much like political theorist francis fukuyama history ended vanished spread globalization unlike fukuyama baudrillard averred end should understood culmination history's progress collapse very idea historical progress
baudrillard end cold war represent ideological victory rather signaled disappearance utopian visions shared both political right left
giving further evidence opposition toward marxist visions global communism liberal visions global civil society baudrillard contended ends hoped illusions indeed illusion end argues thought idea end itself nothing misguided dream end history alas also end dustbins history
there no longer any dustbins disposing old ideologies old regimes old values
going throw marxism actually invented dustbins history? yet there justice here since very people invented them fallen
conclusion there no dustbins history because history itself become dustbin
become own dustbin just planet itself becoming own dustbin
within society subject ruled fast-paced electronic communication global information networks collapse façade going thought inevitable
employing quasi-scientific vocabulary attracted ire physicist alan sokal baudrillard speed society moved destabilized linearity history particle accelerator smashed referential orbit things once
making argument baudrillard found affinity postmodern philosophy jean-françois lyotard famously argued late 20 th century there no longer any room metanarratives
triumph coming communism being such metanarrative
addition simply lamenting collapse history baudrillard also went beyond lyotard attempted analyse how idea forward progress being employed spite notion's declining validity
baudrillard argued although genuine belief universal endpoint history wherein conflicts find their resolution deemed redundant universality still notion utilised world politics excuse actions
universal values according no any longer believed universal still rhetorically employed justify otherwise unjustifiable choices
means there even though ends no longer believed employed order hide present's harsh realities put unrealities
enlightenment universalization viewed unlimited growth forward progress
today contrast universalization expressed forward escape
involves notion escape velocity outlined vital illusion 2000 turn results postmodern fallacy escape velocity postmodern mind critical view cannot definition ever truly break free all-encompassing self-referential sphere discourse
political commentary gulf war baudrillard's provocative book gulf war take place raised public profile academic political commentator
argued first gulf war inverse clausewitzian formula continuation politics other means continuation absence politics other means
accordingly saddam hussein fighting coalition using lives soldiers form sacrifice preserve power p
72 2004 edition
coalition fighting iraqi military merely dropping 10000 tonnes bombs daily proving themselves there enemy fight p
too western media complicit presenting war real time recycling images war propagate notion u
-led coalition iraqi government actually fighting such case
saddam hussein use military capacity iraqi air force
power weakened evinced easy suppression internal uprisings followed afterwards
overall little changed
saddam remained undefeated victors victorious thus there no war—i
gulf war occur
book originally series articles british newspaper guardian french newspaper libération
these published three parts gulf war will take place published during american military rhetorical buildup gulf war taking place published during military action gulf war take place published afterwards
critics accused baudrillard instant revisionism denial physical action conflict related denial reality general
consequently baudrillard accused lazy amoralism cynical scepticism berkelian idealism
sympathetic commentators such william merrin book baudrillard media argued baudrillard concerned west's technological political dominance globalization commercial interests means present possibility war
merrin argued baudrillard denying something happened merely questioning whether something fact war bilateral atrocity masquerading war
merrin viewed accusations amorality redundant based misreading
baudrillard's own words pp
71–72 saddam liquidates communists moscow flirts even gases kurds held against eliminates religious cadres whole islam makes peace
100000 dead will final decoy saddam will sacrificed blood money paid forfeit according calculated equivalence order preserve power
worse these dead still serve alibi those want excited nothing least these dead will prove war indeed war shameful pointless hoax
terrorist attacks september 2001 contrast non-event gulf war essay spirit terrorism characterised terrorist attacks world trade center new york city absolute event
seeking understand them reaction technological political expansion capitalist globalization rather war religiously based civilization-based warfare described absolute event consequences follows clash civilisations religions reaches far beyond islam america efforts being made focus conflict order create delusion visible confrontation solution based upon force
there indeed fundamental antagonism here points past spectre america perhaps epicentre no sense sole embodiment globalisation spectre islam embodiment terrorism either triumphant globalisation battling against itself
accordance theory society baudrillard portrayed attacks symbolic reaction inexorable rise world based commodity exchange
stance criticised two counts
richard wolin seduction unreason forcefully accused baudrillard slavoj žižek celebrating terrorist attacks essentially claiming united states received deserved
žižek however countered accusation wolin's analysis form intellectual barbarism journal critical inquiry saying wolin failed see difference fantasising event stating deserving event
merrin baudrillard media argued baudrillard's position affords terrorists type moral superiority
journal economy society merrin further noted baudrillard gives symbolic facets society unfair privilege above semiotic concerns
second authors questioned whether attacks unavoidable
bruno latour critical inquiry argued baudrillard believed their destruction forced society created them alluding notion towers brought down their own weight
latour's view because baudrillard conceived society terms symbolic semiotic dualism
reception denis dutton founder philosophy & literature's bad writing contest—which listed examples kind willfully obscurantist prose baudrillard frequently criticised—had following say writers their manner stance intentionally provoke challenge criticism their readers
others just invite you think
baudrillard's hyperprose demands you grunt wide-eyed bewildered assent
yearns intellectual influence must fend off any serious analysis own writing remaining free leap bombastic assertion next no matter how brazen
your place simply buy books adopt jargon drop name wherever possible
however two major confrontational books baudrillard's thought—christopher norris's uncritical theory postmodernism intellectuals gulf war —seeks reject media theory position real out hand
other—douglas kellner's jean baudrillard marxism postmodernism beyond —seeks rather analyse baudrillard's relation postmodernism concept baudrillard continued uneasy rarely explicit relationship present marxist counter
regarding former william merrin discussed above published denunciation norris's position
latter baudrillard himself characterised reductive nicholas zurbrugg's jean baudrillard art artefact
willam merrin's work presented sympathetic account attempts place baudrillard opposition himself
thereby merrin argued baudrillard's position semiotic analysis meaning denies himself own position symbolic exchange
merrin thus alludes common criticism structuralist post-structuralist work criticism dissimilar either baudrillard foucault deleuze emphasising interrelation basis subjectivity denies human agency social structures necessarily arise
alain badiou michel de certeau made point generally barry sandywell argued much baudrillard's specific case
finally mark poster baudrillard's editor number present-day academics argue contemporary relevance remarked p
poster's 2 nd ed
selected writings baudrillard's writing up mid-1980 s open several criticisms
fails define key terms such code writing style hyperbolic declarative often lacking sustained systematic analysis appropriate totalizes insights refusing qualify delimit claims
writes particular experiences television images nothing else society mattered extrapolating bleak view world limited base
ignores contradictory evidence such many benefits afforded new media nonetheless poster keen refute most extreme baudrillard's critics likes alan sokal norris see purveyor form reality-denying irrationalism ibid p
7 baudrillard disputing trivial issue reason remains operative actions want arrive next block example assume newtonian universe common sense plan course action walk straight x meters carry out action finally fulfill my goal arriving point question
doubt sort thinking enables historically informed grasp present general
according baudrillard does
concurrent spread hyperreal through media collapse liberal marxist politics master narratives deprives rational subject privileged access truth
important sense individuals no longer citizens eager maximise their civil rights nor proletarians anticipating onset communism
rather consumers hence prey objects defined code
