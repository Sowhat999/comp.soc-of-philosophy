argued true mainly basis neuroscience
clarity determinism contrasted obscurity doctrines free will origination
centuries-dominant philosophical traditions determinism freedom compatibilism incompatibilism examined
according first determinism consistent our freedom moral responsibility according second inconsistent them
honderich considers compatibilism's argument our freedom consists voluntariness doing desire being coerced hence conclusion determinism freedom go together
also examines incompatibilism's argument our freedom consists origination free will our choosing without our choosing's being caused hence conclusion determinism freedom inconsistent
honderich argues both views mistaken since freedom voluntariness freedom origination each fundamental our lives
real problem consequences determinism choosing two traditional doctrines practical trying give up must given up since power origination
honderich's rejection both traditions taken up other philosophers many whom find criticisms decisive

union theory takes possible conscious events like our choices decisions way subjective nevertheless physical rather near-physical events
stand kind lawlike connection neural events sometimes called supervenience mental events neural events
these psychoneural pairs honderich calls them just effects certain causal sequences causes our actions
sort physicalism predecessor notion supervenience since succeeded honderich's writings near-physicalism radical externalism
