although known sociologist ritzer never earned degree sociology trained psychology business
ritzer later interview basically trained myself social theorist learn went
despite challenge ritzer found being trained social theory actually advantageous simply because reasoning limited particular theoretical perspective
listed biggest accomplishments social theory mc donaldization ritzer's idea mc donaldization extension max weber's 1864–1920 classical theory rationalization modern society culture
weber famously used terminology iron cage describe stultifying kafkaesque effects bureaucratized life ritzer applied idea influential social system twenty-first century mc donalds
ritzer argues mc donalds restaurants become better example current forms instrumental rationality ultimately irrational harmful consequences people ritzer identifies four rationalizing dimensions mc donalds contribute process mc donaldization claiming mc donalds aims increase
efficiency mc donalds delivers products quickly easily without inputting excessive amount money
mc donalds model therefore mc donalds operations follow predesigned process leads specified end using productive means
efficiency mc donalds model infiltrated other modern day services such completing tax forms online easy weight loss programs walt disney company fastpasses online dating services e harmony match
calculability america grown connect quantity product quality product bigger better
mc donalds model influential conception due providing lot food much money
while end products feed connection quantity quality product does mc donalds production process
throughout food production everything standardized highly calculated size beef patty amount french fries per order time spent franchise
high calculability mc donalds franchise also extends over academics
thought academic experience high school higher education quantified number gpa
also calculability leads idea longer resume list degrees better candidate during application process
addition academics being affected mc donaldization society sports specifically basketball also affected
used basketball laid-back slow-paced sort game yet through creation fast-food mc donalds shot clock added increase speed game also number points scored
predictability related calculability customers know expect given producer goods services
example customers know every big mac mc donald's going same next there understood predictability menu well overall experience
order maintain predictability each franchise there discipline order systematization formalization routine consistency methodical operation
predictability mc donalds franchise also appears through golden arches front every franchise well scripts employees use customers
walt disney company also regulations place like dress code men women order add predictability each amusement park disney operation
predictability also extended movie sequels tv shows
each movie sequel like spy kids 4 tv show law & order spinoffs plot predictable usually follow preconceived model
control mc donald's restaurants pioneered idea highly specialized tasks employees ensure human workers operating exactly same level
way keep complicated system running smoothly rules regulations make efficiency calculability predictability possible
oftentimes use non-human technology such computers used
mc donalds food already pre-prepared potatoes already cut processed just needing fried heated food preparation process monitored tracked
computers tell managers how many hamburgers needed lunchtime rush other peak times size shape pickles well how many go hamburger managed control
control aspect mc donaldization extended other businesses sylvan learning phone operating systems even birth death
every step learning process sylvan u-shaped tables instruction manuals controlled well each step birthing process modern-day hospitals process dying
mc donaldization profitable desirable cutting edge technological advances
many mc donald's aspects society beneficial advancement enhancement human life
claim rationalization leads egalitarian societies
example supermarkets large grocery stores offer variety availability unlike smaller farmer’s markets generations past
mc donaldization society also allows operations productive improve quality products produce services products lower cost
internet provided countless new services people previously impossible such checking bank statements without having go bank being able purchase things online without leaving house
these things positive effects rationalization mc donaldization society
however mc donaldization also alienates people creates disenchantment world
increased standardization society dehumanizes people institutions
“assembly line” feel fast-food restaurants transcending many other facets life removing humanity previously human experiences
through implementing machines computers society humans start behave like machines therefore become replaced machines
consumption early admirer jean baudrillard’s consumer society 1970 ritzer leading proponent study consumption
addition mc donaldization society most important sources ritzer’s sociology consumption edited explorations sociology consumption fast food restaurants credit cards casinos 2001 enchanting disenchanted world revolutionizing means consumption 2 nd edition 2005 3 rd edition 2009 expressing america critique global credit-card society 1995
ritzer also founding editor don slater sage's journal consumer culture
prosumption first coined alvin toffler 1980 term prosumption used ritzer jurgenson break down false dichotomy production consumption describe dual identity economic activities
ritzer argues prosumption primordial form economic activities current ideal separation production consumption aberrant distorted due effect both industrial revolution post-wwii american consumption boom
recently become popularly acknowledged existence prosumption activities internet web 2
0 resemble prosumption much production consumption individually
various online activities require input consumers such wikipedia entries facebook profiles twitter blog myspace amazon preferences e bay auctions second life etc
ritzer argues should view economic activities continuum prosumption prosumption production p-a-p prosumption consumption p-a-c each pole
something vs
nothing according ritzer something locally conceived controlled social form comparatively rich distinctive substantive content
also describes things being fairly unique
nothing social form generally centrally conceived controlled comparatively devoid distinctive substantive content nothing usually aims standardized homogenous while something refers things personal local flavor
examples nothing mc donald's wal-mart starbucks credit cards internet
examples something local sandwich shops local hardware stores family arts crafts places local breakfast cafe
ritzer believes things embody nothing component dichotomy taking over pushing something out society
explains advantages disadvantages both something nothing mc donaldization society
globalization ritzer's research globalization refers rapidly increasing worldwide integration interdependence societies cultures
book presents sophisticated argument nature globalization terms consumption goods services
defines involving worldwide diffusion practices relations forms social organization growth global consciousness
concept something vs
nothing plays large part understanding ritzer's globalization
society becoming bombarded nothing ritzer seems believe globalization nothing almost unstoppable ritzer's aforementioned globalization nothing 2004/2007 stakes out provocative perspective ongoing voluminous globalization discourse
ritzer globalization typically leads consumption vast quantities serial social forms centrally conceived controlled –one mc donald's hamburger
instance nothing again again- dominates social life ritzer george

insight ritzer's distinctive approach globalization available via special review symposium sage journal thesis eleven number 76 february 2004
globalization book globalization nothing 2004 ritzer quotes globalization consists glocalization grobalization
grobalization term coined ritzer himself refers imperialistic ambitions nations corporations organizations like their desire indeed need impose themselves various geographic areas
opposite glocalization grobalization aims overwhelm local
ultimate goal see profit grow through unilateral homogenization[disambiguation needed] thus earning name grobalization
capitalism americanization mc donaldization parts grobalization
grobalization involves three motor forces capitalism mc donaldization americanization
grobalization creates world
things homogenous ubiquitous
larger forces overwhelm power people adapt innovate ways preserve their autonomy
social processes coercive determining nature local communities little room maneuver
consumer goods media key forces largely dictate nature self groups person joins
ritzer provides american textbook example grobalization
book globalization nothing quotes textbooks “oriented rationalizing mc donaldizing communication information
students rather evaluating competing ideas instead absorb information given them
yet these textbooks surprisingly sold out worldwide slightly revised reflect local standards
glocalization glocalization combination words globalization localization used describe product service developed distributed globally also fashioned accommodate user consumer local market causing products results glocalization vary depending different locations
local individuals able manipulate their own situation world become creative agents products services represented their local environment within glocalized world
ritzer further explains glocalization relatively benign process closest something end things
creates variety heterogeneity within society
metatheory metatheory defined attainment deeper understanding theory creation new theory creation overarching theoretical perspective
there three types metatheorizing mu mp mo

internal-intellectual sector mu identifies schools thought structure current sociologists social theories
internal-social subtype identifies connections sociologists connections sociologists society
last two subsets mu looking macrolevel sociology other two subsets
third subtype mu external-intellectual view sociology looks different studies their concepts tools ideas order apply these aspects sociology
fourth final subset external-social impact social theory larger societal setting studied
second mp aims being prelude theory development
new social theory created due complex study interpretation other sociologists
example karl marx's theories based hegel's theories
theories american sociologist talcott parsons based theories émile durkheim max weber vilfredo pareto thomas humphrey marshall
last mo aims being source perspectives overarch sociological theory
