most first 16 years shannon's life spent gaylord attended public school graduating gaylord high school 1932
shannon showed inclination towards mechanical electrical things
best subjects science mathematics home constructed such devices models planes radio-controlled model boat wireless telegraph system friend's house half-mile away
while growing up also worked messenger western union company
childhood hero thomas edison whom later learned distant cousin
both descendants john ogden 1609–1682 colonial leader ancestor many distinguished people
shannon apolitical atheist
boolean theory beyond 1932 shannon entered university michigan took course introduced work george boole
graduated 1936 two bachelor's degrees electrical engineering mathematics
soon began graduate studies electrical engineering massachusetts institute technology mit worked vannevar bush's differential analyzer early analog computer
while studying complicated ad hoc circuits differential analyzer shannon saw boole's concepts great utility
paper drawn 1937 master's degree thesis symbolic analysis relay switching circuits published 1938 issue transactions american institute electrical engineers
also earned shannon alfred noble american institute american engineers award 1939
howard gardner called shannon's thesis possibly most important also most famous master's thesis century
victor shestakov moscow state university proposed theory systems electrical switches based boolean logic earlier shannon 1935 first publication shestakov's result 1941 after publication shannon's thesis united states
work shannon proved switching circuits used simplify arrangement electromechanical relays used then telephone call routing switches
next expanded concept proving these circuits solve problems boolean algebra solve
last chapter diagrams several circuits including 4-bit full adder
central circuit digital computers
using property electrical switches implement logic fundamental concept underlies electronic digital computers
shannon's work became foundation digital circuit design became widely known electrical engineering community during after world war ii
theoretical rigor shannon's work superseded ad hoc methods prevailed previously
through carnegie institution vannevar bush suggested shannon emboldened master's thesis success should work dissertation cold spring harbor laboratory order develop similar mathematical relationships quantifying mendelian genetics
research resulted shannon's doctor philosophy ph
thesis mit 1940 called algebra theoretical genetics
1940 shannon became national research fellow institute advanced study princeton new jersey
princeton shannon opportunity discuss ideas influential scientists mathematicians such hermann weyl john von neumann also occasional encounters albert einstein kurt gödel
shannon worked freely across disciplines ability may contributed later development mathematical information theory
wartime research shannon then joined bell labs work fire-control systems cryptography during world war ii under contract section d-2 control systems section national defense research committee ndrc
shannon met wife betty she numerical analyst bell labs
married 1949
shannon credited invention signal-flow graphs 1942
discovered topological gain formula while investigating functional operation analog computer
two months early 1943 shannon came contact leading british cryptanalyst mathematician alan turing
turing posted washington share u
navy's cryptanalytic service methods used british government code cypher school bletchley park break ciphers used kriegsmarine u-boats north atlantic ocean
also interested encipherment speech end spent time bell labs
shannon turing met teatime cafeteria
turing showed shannon 1936 paper defined now known universal turing machine impressed shannon many ideas complemented own
1945 war coming end ndrc issuing summary technical reports last step prior eventual closing down
inside volume fire control special essay titled data smoothing prediction fire-control systems coauthored shannon ralph beebe blackman hendrik wade bode formally treated problem smoothing data fire-control analogy problem separating signal interfering noise communications systems
other words modeled problem terms data signal processing thus heralded coming information age
shannon's work cryptography even closely related later publications communication theory
close war prepared classified memorandum bell telephone labs entitled mathematical theory cryptography dated september 1945
declassified version paper published 1949 communication theory secrecy systems bell system technical journal
paper incorporated many concepts mathematical formulations also appeared mathematical theory communication
shannon wartime insights communication theory cryptography developed simultaneously close together you couldn’t separate them
footnote near beginning classified report shannon announced intention develop these results
forthcoming memorandum transmission information
while bell labs shannon proved cryptographic one-time pad unbreakable classified research later published october 1949
also proved any unbreakable system must essentially same characteristics one-time pad key must truly random large plaintext never reused whole part kept secret
later american venona project supposed one-time pad system soviets partially broken national security agency because misuses one-time pads soviet cryptographic technicians united states canada
soviet technicians made mistake using same pads once sometimes noticed american cryptanalysts
postwar contributions 1948 promised memorandum appeared mathematical theory communication article two parts july october issues bell system technical journal
work focuses problem how best encode information sender wants transmit
fundamental work used tools probability theory developed norbert wiener their nascent stages being applied communication theory time
shannon developed information entropy measure uncertainty message while essentially inventing field information theory
book co-authored warren weaver mathematical theory communication reprints shannon's 1948 article weaver's popularization accessible non-specialist
warren weaver pointed out word information communication theory related you say you say
information measure one's freedom choice selects message
shannon's concepts also popularized subject own proofreading john robinson pierce's symbols signals noise
information theory's fundamental contribution natural language processing computational linguistics further established 1951 article prediction entropy printed english showing upper lower bounds entropy statistics english giving statistical foundation language analysis
addition proved treating whitespace 27 th letter alphabet actually lowers uncertainty written language providing clear quantifiable link cultural practice probabilistic cognition
another notable paper published 1949 communication theory secrecy systems declassified version wartime work mathematical theory cryptography proved theoretically unbreakable ciphers must same requirements one-time pad
also credited introduction sampling theory concerned representing continuous-time signal uniform discrete set samples
theory essential enabling telecommunications move analog digital transmissions systems 1960 s later
returned mit hold endowed chair 1956
hobbies inventions minivac 601 digital computer trainer designed shannon
outside academic pursuits shannon interested juggling see robot juggling unicycling chess
also invented many devices including rocket-powered flying discs motorized pogo stick flame-throwing trumpet science exhibition[citation needed]
humorous devices box kept desk called ultimate machine based idea marvin minsky
otherwise featureless box possessed single switch side
switch flipped lid box opened mechanical hand reached out flipped off switch then retracted back inside box
renewed interest ultimate machine emerged you tube thingiverse
addition built device solve rubik's cube puzzle
shannon designed minivac 601 digital computer trainer teach business people how computers functioned

other work shannon famous electromechanical mouse theseus named after theseus greek mythology tried solve maze first experiments artificial intelligence
shannon's mouse theseus created 1950 magnetic mouse controlled relay circuit enabled move around maze 25 squares
dimensions same those average mouse
maze configuration flexible modified will
mouse designed search through corridors until found target
having travelled through maze mouse then placed anywhere before because prior experience go directly target
placed unfamiliar territory programmed search until reached known location then proceed target adding new knowledge memory thus learning
shannon's mouse appears first artificial learning device kind
shannon's computer chess program 1950 shannon published paper computer chess entitled programming computer playing chess
describes how machine computer made play reasonable game chess
process having computer decide move make minimax procedure based evaluation function given chess position
shannon gave rough example evaluation function value black position subtracted white position
material counted according usual chess piece relative value point pawn 3 points knight bishop 5 points rook 9 points queen
considered positional factors subtracting ½ point each doubled pawns backward pawn isolated pawn
another positional factor evaluation function mobility adding 0
point each legal move available
finally considered checkmate capture king gave king artificial value 200 points
quoting paper coefficients
merely writer's rough estimate
furthermore there many other terms should included
formula given illustrative purposes
checkmate artificially included here giving king large value 200 anything greater maximum other terms
evaluation function clearly illustrative purposes shannon stated
example according function pawns doubled well isolated no value clearly unrealistic
