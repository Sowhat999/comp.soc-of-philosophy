religious studies scholar egil asprem characterised idol skinheads inclination towards paganism contemporary pagans inclination towards national socialism
political affiliation after conviction vikernes began identifying himself neo-nazi
encyclopedia white power describes busy promoting odinist national socialist philosophy behind bars
july 2005 statement website entitled nazi ghost vikernes states although occasionally used term 'nazism' describe [his] ideological foundation no longer describes himself 'nazi'
reason drawn occasionally expressed support nazism mainly because many norwegian german nazis embraced our pagan religion our blood-religion rejected judeo-christianity jewish heresy vikernes expresses desire associated anti-slavic sentiments
identifies three things distinguish nazis unlike them am socialistic even national level am materialistic believe ancient scandinavian! democracy
late 1990 s avoid confusion find term suitable accurate vikernes coined term odalism based odal rune
[f]rom norse óðal homeland allodium allodial law nobility noble inherited goods fatherland land property distinguished family distinguished splendid kin nation
explains lies paganism traditional nationalism racialism environmentalism
vikernes contrasts modern 'civilization' equates capitalism materialism judeo-christianity pollution urbanization race-mixing americanization socialism globalization et cetera
places importance fact odalism term tainted history contrast nazism 'nazi ghost' scared millions europeans caring their blood homeland sixty years now time banish ghost again start think care things whether like important us
other texts website embraces nordicism racism eugenics race hygiene

believe europe waking up
vikernes written lyrics several songs darkthrone make use themes old germanic folklore
these satan referenced aspect germanic god odin context eye source light
sun there also mentions spear hall battle also masked references odin
done double meaning odin adversary jewish christian tradition
many thus inferred vikernes satanist though stated many times opposed satanism considers reactionary form christianity
according vikernes christianity created decadent degenerated romans tool oppression late roman era should treated accordingly
like handcuff's mind spirit nothing destructive mankind
fact don't really see christianity religion
like spiritual plague mass psychosis should first foremost treated problem solved medical science
christianity diagnosis
it's like islam other asian religions hiv/aids spirit mind
vikernes now embraces modern scientific worldview resting foundation made up pagan values ideals loyalty wisdom courage love discipline honesty intelligence beauty responsibility health strength
draws direct connection both race intelligence intelligence religion denouncing theism mental enslavement fit inferior races
vikernes goes say supposed serve purpose paganism needs ideology religion
despite accusing mainstream theists holding onto stone age misconceptions vikernes still holds religious myths should turned areas science yet achieved complete understanding natural world — such origin life go after death anywhere
later 2009 posted article website writing obviously live different world discuss ones perception reality without any fear harassment world tolerance respect world intellectual debate honesty
