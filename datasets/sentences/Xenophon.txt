9 participate expedition led cyrus younger against older brother king artaxerxes ii persia
anabasis main article anabasis xenophon expedition cyrus written years after these events xenophon's book anabasis greek ἀνάβασις literally going up record entire expedition cyrus against persians greek mercenaries’ journey home
xenophon writes asked veteran socrates advice whether go cyrus socrates referred divinely inspired delphic oracle
xenophon's query oracle however whether accept cyrus' invitation gods must pray sacrifice might best accomplish intended journey return safety good fortune
oracle answered question gods pray sacrifice
xenophon returned athens socrates oracle's advice socrates chastised asking disingenuous question anabasis 3
under pretext fighting tissaphernes persian satrap ionia cyrus assembled massive army composed native persian soldiers also large number greeks
prior waging war against artaxerxes cyrus proposed enemy pisidians greeks unaware battle against larger army king artaxerxes ii anabasis
tarsus soldiers became aware cyrus's plans depose king result refused continue anabasis
however clearchus spartan general convinced greeks continue expedition
army cyrus met army artaxerxes ii battle cunaxa
despite effective fighting greeks cyrus killed battle anabasis
shortly thereafter clearchus invited peace conference alongside four other generals many captains betrayed executed anabasis 2
return route xenophon ten thousand mercenaries known ten thousand found themselves without leadership far sea deep hostile territory near heart mesopotamia
elected new leaders including xenophon himself fought their way north along tigris through hostile persians medes trapezus coast black sea anabasis 4
then made their way westward back greece via chrysopolis anabasis 6
once there helped seuthes ii make himself king thrace before being recruited army spartan general thibron
spartans war tissaphernes pharnabazus persian satraps anatolia probably account aforementioned treacherous slaughter their general clearchus
xenophon’s military activity these spartans marks final episodes anabasis books 6–7
exile death upon return greece proper xenophon continued associate spartans even far fight under spartan king agesilaus ii against native athens battle coronea 394 bc
account exiled athens
there may contributory causes such support socrates well fact taken service persians
spartans gave property scillus near olympia elis likely composed anabasis
because son gryllus fought died athens battle mantinea while xenophon still alive xenophon's banishment may revoked
nevertheless after battle leuktra 371 end spartan hegemony xenophon moved corinth athens died
died around 355 bce exact date uncertain historians know survived patron agesilaus ii whom encomium shared spartan king's name
xenophon's politics xenophon long associated opposition democracy
although xenophon seems prefer oligarchy least aristocracy especially light associations sparta none works explicitly attack democracy unless account democratic proceedings anabasis interpreted anti-democracy deliberations intimidated cries pelt speaker says something others disagree
scholars go far say views aligned those democracy time
however certain works xenophon particular cyropaedia appear display pro-oligarchic politics
historical-fiction serves forum xenophon subtly display political inclinations
cyropaedia relations medes persians cyropaedia xenophon cyropaedia present political moral philosophy
endowing historical figure cyrus qualities should possessed xenophon's ideal ruler
historians asked whether xenophon's portrait accurate portrayal cyrus alone xenophon imbued events own life
consensus cyrus’s career best outlined histories herodotus
steven hirsch writes yet there occasions confirmed oriental evidence xenophon correct herodotus wrong lacks information
case point involves ancestry cyrus
herodotus contradicts xenophon several other points most notably matter cyrus’s relationship median kingdom
herodotus says cyrus led rebellion against maternal grandfather astyages king media defeated thereafter improbably keeping astyages court remainder life histories
medes thus reduced subjection
130 became slaves
129 persians 20 years before capture babylon 539
cyropaedia relates instead astyages died succeeded son cyaxares ii maternal uncle cyrus
initial campaign against lydians babylonians their allies medians led cyaxares persians cyrus crown prince persians since father still alive 4
xenophon relates time medes strongest kingdoms opposed babylonians
there echo statement verifying xenophon contradicting herodotus harran stele document court nabonidus
entry year 14 15 reign 542-540
nabonidus speaks enemies kings egypt medes arabs
there no mention persians although according herodotus current consensus medians made slaves persians several years previously
does seem nabonidus completely misled enemies really control over medes persians just three years before kingdom fell their armies
bas-reliefs persian soldiers together median soldiers prevalent persepolis
ones rounded caps median
other archaeological evidence supporting xenophon’s picture confederation medes persians rather subjugation medes persians comes bas-reliefs stairway persepolis
these show no distinction official rank status persian median nobility
although olmstead followed consensus view cyrus subjugated medes nevertheless medes honored equally persians employed high office chosen lead persian armies
extensive list considerations related credibility cyropaedia’s picture relationship medes persians found cyropaedia page
both herodotus
123214 xenophon
20 present cyrus 40 years old forces captured babylon
nabonidus chronicle there mention death wife king name given within month after capture babylon
conjectured cyrus’s first wife lends credibility cyropaedia’s statement
19 cyaxares ii gave daughter marriage cyrus soon immediately after fall city kingdom media her dowry
cyaxares died two years later median kingdom passed peaceably cyrus true beginning medo-persian empire under just monarch
persians centaurs cyropaedia whole lavishes great deal praise first persian emperor cyrus great account virtue leadership quality through greatness persian empire held together
thus book normally read positive treatise cyrus
however following lead leo strauss david johnson suggests there subtle strong layer book xenophon conveys criticism persians spartans athenians well
section 4
3 cyropaedia cyrus makes clear desire institute cavalry
even goes far say desires no persian kalokagathos noble good man literally simply noble ever seen foot horse much persians may actually seem centaurs 4
centaurs often thought creatures ill repute makes even cyrus’ own advisors wary label
minister chrysantas admires centaurs their dual nature also warns dual nature does allow centaurs fully enjoy act either their aspects full 4
labeling persians centaurs through mouth cyrus xenophon plays upon popular post-persian-war propagandistic paradigm using mythological imagery represent greco-persian conflict
examples include wedding lapiths giantomachy trojan war amazonomachy parthenon frieze
johnson reads even deeply centaur label
believes unstable dichotomy man horse found centaur indicative unstable unnatural alliance persian mede formulated cyrus
persian hardiness austerity combined luxuriousness medes two qualities cannot coexist
cites regression persians directly after death cyrus result instability union made possible through impeccable character cyrus
further analysis centaur model cyrus likened centaur such chiron noble example ignoble race
thus entire paradigm seems jab persians indication xenophon’s general distaste persians
against empire/monarchy strength cyrus holding empire together praiseworthy according xenophon
however empire began decline upon death cyrus
example xenophon sought show empires lacked stability maintained person remarkable prowess such cyrus
cyrus idealized greatly narrative
xenophon displays cyrus cold passionless man
say good ruler depicted surreal subject foibles other men
showing someone almost beyond human conduct such enterprise empire xenophon indirectly censures imperial design
thus also reflects state own reality even indirect fashion using example persians decry attempts empire made athens sparta
although partially graced hindsight having written cyropaedia after downfall athens peloponnesian war work criticizes greek attempts empire monarchy dooming them failure
against democracy another passage johnson cites criticism monarchy empire concerns devaluation homotīmoi
manner occurs seems also subtle yet poignant jab democracy
homotīmoi highly thoroughly educated thus became core soldiery heavy infantry
name homotīmoi equal same honors
peers suggests their small band 1000 cyrus fought assyrians shared equally spoils war
however face overwhelming numbers campaign against assyrians cyrus armed commoners similar arms instead their normal light ranged armament cyropaedia 2
argument ensued how spoils now split cyrus enforced meritocracy
many homotīmoi found unfair because their military training no better commoners their education hand-to-hand combat less matter skill strength bravery
johnson asserts passage decries imperial meritocracy corruption homotīmoi now sychophantize emperor positions honors point referred entīmoi no longer same honors having get honor
other hand passage seems critical democracy least sympathetic aristocrats within democracy homotīmoi aristocracy/oligarchs devalued upon empowerment commoners demos
although empire emerges case also sequence events associated democracy
through dual critique empire democracy xenophon subtly relates support oligarchy
constitution spartans spartans nothing themselves lost
therefore know them comes exclusively outsiders such xenophon
xenophon’s affinity spartans clear constitution spartans well penchant oligarchy
opening line reads occurred me day sparta though among most thinly populated states evidently most powerful most celebrated city greece fell wondering how happened
considered institutions spartans wondered no longer
xenophon goes describe detail main aspects lacedaemonian state handing us most comprehensive extant analysis institutions sparta
old oligarch short treatise constitution athens exists once thought xenophon probably written xenophon five years old
author often called english old oligarch pseudo-xenophon detests democracy athens poorer classes argues periclean institutions well designed their deplorable purposes
although real xenophon seems prefer oligarchy over democracy none works ardently decry democracy does constitution athenians
however treatise makes evident anti-democratic sentiments extant athens late 5 th century
increased after shortcomings exploited made apparent during peloponnesian war
socratic works dialogues xenophon’s works includes selection socratic dialogues
these writings completely preserved
except dialogues plato surviving representatives genre sokratikoi logoi socratic dialogues
these works include xenophon's apology memorabilia symposium oeconomicus
symposium outlines character socrates companions discuss attribute take pride
oeconomicus socrates explains how manage household
both apology memorabilia defend socrates’ character teachings
former set during trial socrates essentially defending socrates’ loss death while latter general defense socrates explaining moral principles corrupter youth
relationship socrates xenophon student socrates their personal relationship evident through direct conversation two xenophon’s anabasis
xenophon's admiration teacher clear writings such symposium apology memorabilia
xenophon away persian campaign during trial death socrates
nevertheless much xenophon's socratic writing especially apology concerns very trial defense socrates put forward
lives eminent philosophers greek biographer diogenes laertius reports how xenophon met socrates
say socrates met [xenophon] narrow lane put stick across prevented passing asking kinds necessary things sold
answered asked again men made good virtuous
know ‘follow me then learn
’ time forth xenophon became follower socrates
socrates xenophon vs
plato both plato xenophon apology concerning death socrates
two writers seem concerned answering questions arose after trial actual charges
particular xenophon plato concerned failures socrates defend himself
socrates xenophon portrayed different plato’s multiple respects
xenophon asserts socrates dealt prosecution exceedingly arrogant manner least perceived spoken arrogantly
conversely while omitting completely plato worked temper arrogance own apology
xenophon framed socrates’ defense both men admit prepared failure effectively argue side striving death even light unconvincing charges
danzig interprets convincing jury condemn even unconvincing charges rhetorical challenge worthy great persuader
xenophon uses interpretation justification socrates’ arrogant stance conventional failure
contrast plato does go far claim socrates actually desired death seems argue socrates attempting demonstrate higher moral standard teach lesson although defense failed conventional standards
places socrates higher moral position prosecutors typical platonic example absolving socrates blame every conceivable way
historical reality although xenophon claims present symposium impossible young boy date proposes occurred
again xenophon present trial socrates having campaign anatolia persia
thus puts latter’s mouth thought say
seems xenophon apology memorabilia defenses former teacher explain socrates' relationship actual charges incurred
modern reception xenophon's standing political philosopher defended recent times leo strauss devoted considerable part philosophic analysis works xenophon returning high judgment xenophon thinker expressed shaftesbury winckelmann machiavelli john adams
xenophon’s lessons leadership reconsidered their modern-day value
jennifer o’flannery holds discussions leadership civic virtue should include work xenophon
public education public service
cyropaedia outlining cyrus ideal leader having mastered qualities education equality consensus justice service state work she suggests used guide example those striving leaders see mirrors princes
linking moral code education especially pertinent quality subscribed cyrus o’flannery believes line modern perceptions leadership
