exact contributions difficult disentangle those mentor leucippus often mentioned together texts
their speculation atoms taken leucippus bears passing partial resemblance nineteenth-century understanding atomic structure led regard democritus scientist other greek philosophers however their ideas rested very different bases
largely ignored ancient athens democritus disliked much plato latter wished books burned

born 80 th olympiad 460–457 bc according apollodorus athens although thrasyllus placed birth 470 bc later date probably likely
john burnet argued date 460 too early since according diogenes laërtius ix
41 democritus young man neos during anaxagoras' old age c
democritus' father noble family wealthy received xerxes march through abdera
democritus spent inheritance father left travels distant countries satisfy thirst knowledge
traveled asia even reached india ethiopia
known babylon meroe visited egypt diodorus siculus states lived there five years
himself declared among contemporaries none made greater journeys seen countries met scholars himself
particularly mentions egyptian mathematicians whose knowledge praises
theophrastus too spoke man seen many countries
during travels according diogenes laërtius became acquainted chaldean magi
ostanes magi accompanying xerxes also taught
after returning native land occupied himself natural philosophy
traveled throughout greece acquire better knowledge cultures
mentions many greek philosophers writings wealth enabled purchase their writings
leucippus founder atomism greatest influence upon
also praises anaxagoras
diogenes laertius says friends hippocrates
may acquainted socrates plato does mention democritus himself quoted saying came athens no knew me
aristotle placed among pre-socratic natural philosophers
many anecdotes democritus especially diogenes laërtius attest disinterest modesty simplicity show lived exclusively studies
story deliberately blinding himself order less disturbed pursuits may well true lost sight old age
cheerful ready see comical side life later writers took mean laughed foolishness people
highly esteemed fellow citizens because diogenes laërtius says foretold them things events proved true may refer knowledge natural phenomena
according diodorus siculus democritus died age 90 put death around 370 bc other writers living 104 even 109
marcus aurelius book meditations says democritus eaten lice vermin although same passage writes other lice killed socrates suggesting might metaphorical
popularly known laughing philosopher laughing human follies terms abderitan laughter means scoffing incessant laughter abderite means scoffer derived democritus
fellow citizens also known mocker
philosophy science democritus meditating seat soul léon-alexandre delhomme 1868
most sources say democritus followed tradition leucippus carried scientific rationalist philosophy associated miletus
both thoroughly materialist believing everything result natural laws
unlike aristotle plato atomists attempted explain world without reasoning purpose prime mover final cause
atomists questions physics should answered mechanistic explanation earlier circumstances caused event? while their opponents search explanations addition material mechanistic also included formal teleological purpose event serve?
aesthetics later grecian historians consider democritus established aesthetics subject investigation study theoretically poetry fine art long before authors such aristotle
specifically thrasyllus identified six works philosopher's oeuvre belonged aesthetics discipline fragments relevant works extant hence democritus' writings these matters small percentage thoughts ideas known
atomic hypothesis see also atomism theory democritus held everything composed atoms physically geometrically indivisible atoms there lies empty space atoms indestructible will motion there infinite number atoms kinds atoms differ shape size
mass atoms democritus any indivisible exceeds heavier
exact position atomic weight disputed
leucippus widely credited having first develop theory atomism although isaac newton preferred credit obscure mochus phoenician whom believed biblical moses inventor idea authority posidonius strabo
stanford encyclopedia philosophy notes theologically motivated view does seem claim much historical evidence however
democritus along leucippus epicurus proposed earliest views shapes connectivity atoms
reasoned solidness material corresponded shape atoms involved
thus iron atoms solid strong hooks lock them solid water atoms smooth slippery salt atoms because their taste sharp pointed air atoms light whirling pervading other materials
using analogies humans' sense experiences gave picture image atom distinguished them each other their shape their size arrangement their parts
moreover connections explained material links single atoms supplied attachments hooks eyes others balls sockets
democritean atom inert solid merely excluding other bodies volume interacts other atoms mechanically
contrast modern quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric magnetic force fields far inert
theory atomists appears nearly aligned modern science any other theory antiquity
however similarity modern concepts science confusing trying understand hypothesis came
obvious classical atomists never solid empirical basis modern concepts atoms molecules
bertrand russell states simply hit lucky hypothesis recently confirmed evidence
however lucretius describing atomism de rerum natura gives very clear compelling empirical arguments original atomist theory
observes any material subject irreversible decay
through time even hard rocks slowly worn down drops water
things tendency get mixed up mix water soil mud will result seldom disintegrating itself
wood decays
however there mechanisms nature technology recreate pure materials like water air metals
[citation needed] seed oak will grow out oak tree made similar wood historical oak trees wood already decayed
conclusion many properties materials must derive something inside will itself never decay something stores eternity same inherent indivisible properties
basic question why everything world yet decayed how exactly same materials plants animals recreated again again? obvious solution explain how indivisible properties conveyed way easily visible human senses hypothesize existence atoms
these classical atoms nearer humans' modern concept molecule atoms modern science
other central point classical atomism there must considerable open space these atoms void
lucretius gives reasonable arguments[citation needed] void absolutely necessary explain how gasses liquids flow change shape while metals molded without their basic material properties changing
void hypothesis atomistic void hypothesis response paradoxes parmenides zeno founders metaphysical logic put forth difficult answer arguments favor idea there no movement
held any movement require void—which nothing—but nothing cannot exist
parmenidean position you say there void therefore void nothing therefore there void
position parmenides appeared validated observation there seems nothing there air indeed even there matter there something instance light waves
atomists agreed motion required void simply ignored argument parmenides grounds motion observable fact
therefore asserted there must void
idea survived refined version newton's theory absolute space met logical requirements attributing reality not-being
einstein's theory relativity provided new answer parmenides zeno insight space itself relative cannot separated time part generally curved space-time manifold
consequently newton's refinement now considered superfluous
epistemology democritus luca giordano c
knowledge truth according democritus difficult since perception through senses subjective
same senses derive different impressions each individual then through sense-impressions cannot judge truth
interpret sense data through intellect grasp truth because truth bottom again many other animals receive impressions contrary ours even senses each individual things seem same
then these impressions true false obvious set no true other both alike
why democritus any rate says either there no truth us least evident
democritus says convention hot convention cold reality atoms void also reality know nothing since truth bottom
there two kinds knowing calls legitimate γνησίη gnesie genuine other bastard σκοτίη skotie secret
bastard knowledge concerned perception through senses therefore insufficient subjective
reason sense-perception due effluences atoms objects senses
these different shapes atoms come us stimulate our senses according their shape our sense-impressions arise those stimulations
second sort knowledge legitimate achieved through intellect other words sense-data bastard must elaborated through reasoning
way get away false perception bastard knowledge grasp truth through inductive reasoning
after taking account sense-impressions examine causes appearances draw conclusions laws govern appearances discover causality αἰτιολογία aetiologia related
procedure thought parts whole else apparent non-apparent inductive reasoning
example why democritus considered early scientific thinker
process reminiscent science gathers conclusions canons democritus says there two kinds knowing through senses other through intellect
these calls through intellect 'legitimate' attesting trustworthiness judgement truth through senses names 'bastard' denying inerrancy discrimination true
quote actual words knowledge there two forms legitimate bastard
bastard belong group sight hearing smell taste touch
other legitimate separate
then preferring legitimate bastard continues bastard no longer see any smaller hear smell taste perceive touch finer matters examined then comes legitimate since finer organ perception
says actuality grasp nothing certain shifts accordance condition body things atoms enter press upon
well democritus used say 'he prefers discover causality rather become king persia'
ethics politics crying heraclitus laughing democritus 1477 italian fresco pinacoteca di brera milan
ethics politics democritus come us mostly form maxims
such stanford encyclopedia philosophy gone far say despite large number ethical sayings difficult construct coherent account democritus' ethical views noting there difficulty deciding fragments genuinely democritean
says equality everywhere noble encompassing enough include women slaves sentiment
poverty democracy better prosperity under tyrants same reason prefer liberty over slavery
those power should take upon themselves lend poor aid them favor them then there pity no isolation companionship mutual defense concord among citizens other good things too many catalogue
money used sense leads generosity charity while money used folly leads common expense whole society— excessive hoarding money one's children avarice
while making money useless says doing result wrongdoing worst things
whole ambivalent towards wealth values much less self-sufficiency
disliked violence pacifist urged cities prepared war believed society right execute criminal enemy long violate law treaty oath
goodness believed came practice discipline innate human nature
believed should distance oneself wicked stating such association increases disposition vice
anger while difficult control must mastered order rational
those take pleasure disasters their neighbors fail understand their fortunes tied society live rob themselves any joy their own
democritus believed happiness property soul
advocated life contentment little grief possible achieved through either idleness preoccupation worldly pleasures
contentment gained through moderation measured life content must set their judgment possible satisfied has—giving little thought envy admiration
democritus approved extravagance occasion held feasts celebrations necessary joy relaxation
considers education noblest pursuits cautioned learning without sense leads error
mathematics right circular oblique circular cones democritus also pioneer mathematics geometry particular
know through citations works titled numbers geometrics tangencies mapping irrationals other writings since most democritus' body work survive middle ages
democritus among first observe cone pyramid one-third volume cylinder prism respectively same base height
anthropology biology cosmology work nature known through citations books subjects nature man flesh two books mind senses flavors colors causes concerned seeds plants fruits causes concerned animals three books
spent much life experimenting examining plants minerals length many scientific topics
democritus thought first humans lived anarchic animal sort life going out forage individually living off most palatable herbs fruit grew wild trees
driven together societies fear wild animals
believed these early people no language gradually began articulate their expressions establishing symbols every sort object manner came understand each other
says earliest men lived laboriously having none utilities life clothing houses fire domestication farming unknown them
democritus presents early period mankind learning trial error says each step slowly led discoveries took refuge caves winter stored fruits preserved through reason keenness mind came build upon each new idea
democritus held originally universe composed nothing tiny atoms churning chaos until collided together form larger units—including earth everything
surmised there many worlds growing decaying no sun moon several
held every world beginning end world destroyed collision another world
epitomize democritus's cosmology russell calls shelley worlds worlds rolling ever / creation decay / like bubbles river / sparkling bursting borne away
