philosophical theological contributions michael j
mc vicar summarized rushdoony's theology philosophy follows theologian rushdoony saw human beings primarily religious creatures bound god rational autonomous thinkers
while may seem esoteric theological point isn't
rushdoony's influence christian right stems single essential fact
many critics christian reconstructionism assume rushdoony's unique contribution christian right focus theocracy
fact rushdoony's primary innovation single-minded effort popularize pre-enlightenment medieval view god-centered world
de-emphasizing humanity's ability reason independently god rushdoony attacked assumptions most us uncritically accept
rushdoony developed philosophy extension work calvinist philosopher cornelius van til
van til critiqued human knowledge light calvinist doctrine total depravity
argued sin affected person's ability reason
order rational van til claimed must presuppose existence god inerrant divine inspiration protestant bible
rushdoony attended implications van til held true knowledge came god rushdoony asserted non-christian knowledge sinful invalid nonsense
valid knowledge non-christians possess 'stolen' 'christian-theistic' sources
effect rushdoony extended van til's thinking philosophy life thought
early writings rushdoony began popularizing albeit densely works calvinist philosophers cornelius van til herman dooyeweerd short survey contemporary humanism called standard?
arguing calvinist system thought rushdoony dealt subjects broad epistemology cognitive metaphysics narrow psychology religion predestination
book many studies philosophy order ultimacy using van tillian presuppositional philosophy critique various aspects secular humanism
also many essays book reviews published such venues westminster theological journal
homeschooling early 1960 s rushdoony active homeschooling movement appearing expert witness defend rights homeschoolers
rushdoony's next focus education especially behalf homeschooling saw way combat intentionally secular nature u
public school system
vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such horace mann john dewey argued dismantling state's influence education three works intellectual schizophrenia general concise study education messianic character american education history castigation public education u
philosophy christian curriculum parent-oriented pedagogical statement
history rushdoony then pursued history world united states church
maintained calvinistic christianity provided intellectual roots american revolution thus influential impact american history
american revolution according rushdoony conservative counterrevolution preserve american liberties british usurpation owed nothing enlightenment
further argued united states constitution secular document appearance didn't need establish christianity official religion since states already christian establishments
drawing work theologian robert lewis dabney rushdoony argued american civil war destroyed early american republic envisioned decentralized protestant feudal system orthodox christian nation rushdoony saw north's victory defeat christian orthodoxy
historians argued aspect rushdoony's thought influenced activists neo-confederate movement conservative writers like j
steven wilkins

matter israel's place history subject believed prophet daniel makes clear god by-passed chosen people favor four great monarchies
then called forth fifth monarchy no means identified israel
christian reconstruction see also dominionism christian reconstructionism rushdoony's most important area writing however law politics expressed small book popular essays law & liberty discussed much greater detail three-volume 1894-page magnum opus institutes biblical law
title modeled after calvin's institutes christian religion rushdoony's institutes arguably most influential work
book proposed old testament law should applied modern society there should christian theonomy concept developed colleague greg bahnsen's controversial tome theonomy christian ethics rushdoony heartily endorsed
institutes rushdoony supported reinstatement mosaic law's penal sanctions
under such system list civil crimes carried death sentence include homosexuality adultery incest lying one's virginity bestiality witchcraft idolatry apostasy public blasphemy false prophesying kidnapping rape bearing false witness capital case
although supporting separation church state national level rushdoony understood both institutions under rule god thus conceived secularism posing endless false dichotomies massive work addresses considerable detail
short sought cast vision reconstruction society based christian principles
book also critical democracy
heresy democracy since then worked havoc church state
christianity democracy inevitably enemies
elsewhere christianity completely radically anti-democratic committed spiritual aristocracy characterized democracy great love failures cowards life
rushdoony's work used dominion theology advocates attempt implement christian theocracy government subject biblical law especially torah united states
authority behavioural boundaries economics penology like governed biblical principles rushdoony's vision also proposed wide system freedom especially economic sphere claimed ludwig von mises intellectual mentor called himself christian libertarian
rushdoony founder 1965 chalcedon foundation editor monthly magazine chalcedon report
also published journal christian reconstruction early board member rutherford institute founded 1982 john w
1972 cornelius van til disclaimed affiliation rushdoony christian reconstructionist movement writing
am frankly little concerned political views mr
rushdoony mr
north particularly am correctly informed views gary north respect application old testament principles our day
my point hope expect claim such views inherent principles hold
criticism rushdoony remains controversial figure christian reconstructionist movement involved
pointing rushdoony's support death penalty british centre science education decried perceived dislike democracy tolerance
furthermore rushdoony accused holocaust denial racism
according frank schaeffer rushdoony believed interracial marriage referred unequal yoking should made illegal
also opposed enforced integration referred southern slavery benevolent people nature slaves
kerwin lee klein however argues rushdoony biological racialist racism founded modern biology simply represented another pagan revival
institutes biblical law uses 1967 work judaism vatican léon de poncins source paul rassinier's figure
2 million jewish deaths during holocaust claim raul hilberg calculated number 896292 further asserts very many these died epidemics
calls charge 6 million jewish deaths false witness against germany
2000 rushdoony stated concerning passage institutes my purpose enter debate over numbers whether millions killed tens millions area must left others expertise such matters
my point then now such matters ninth commandment requires truth exaggeration irrespective cause seeks serve
carl r
trueman professor historical theology church history westminster theological seminary 2009 regarding passage rushdoony's holocaust denial sources atrocious secondhand unverified held position speaks volumes appalling incompetence historian speculate why held position moral perspective
deals matter under issue ninth commandment ironically breaches himself presentation matter
