voice toward philosophy vocal expression 2005 cavarero's next book voice toward philosophy vocal expression re-thinks relation speech politics announced aristotle's formula whereby man's nature political animal [zoon politikon] bound up man's characterization animal speech [zoon logon echon] focusing her attention embodied uniqueness speaker manifested speaker's voice addressed another

she argues precisely alternative care doing harm pure gratuitous cruelty generative nucleus horror precisely because vulnerability condition human life given birth death
horrorism speak radical rejection care wound inflicted precisely care most needed
therefore violence strikes deeply dignity unique bodily life harmed better because horror form violence made possible heightened vulnerability helplessness also implicitly reveals dignity
