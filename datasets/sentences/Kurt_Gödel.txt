considered aristotle gottlob frege most significant logicians history gödel made immense impact upon scientific philosophical thinking 20 th century time others such bertrand russell
whitehead david hilbert pioneering use logic set theory understand foundations mathematics
gödel published two incompleteness theorems 1931 25 years old year after finishing doctorate university vienna
first incompleteness theorem states any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough describe arithmetic natural numbers example peano arithmetic there true propositions naturals cannot proved axioms
prove theorem gödel developed technique now known gödel numbering codes formal expressions natural numbers
also showed neither axiom choice nor continuum hypothesis disproved accepted axioms set theory assuming these axioms consistent
former result opened door mathematicians assume axiom choice their proofs
also made important contributions proof theory clarifying connections classical logic intuitionistic logic modal logic

according brother rudolf age six seven kurt suffered rheumatic fever completely recovered rest life remained convinced heart suffered permanent damage
gödel attended evangelische volksschule lutheran school brünn 1912 1916 enrolled deutsches staats-realgymnasium 1916 1924 excelling honors subjects particularly mathematics languages religion
although kurt first excelled languages later became interested history mathematics
interest mathematics increased 1920 older brother rudolf born 1902 left vienna go medical school university vienna
during teens kurt studied gabelsberger shorthand goethe's theory colours criticisms isaac newton writings immanuel kant
studying vienna age 18 gödel joined brother vienna entered university vienna
time already mastered university-level mathematics
although initially intending study theoretical physics also attended courses mathematics philosophy
during time adopted ideas mathematical realism
read kant's metaphysische anfangsgründe naturwissenschaft participated vienna circle moritz schlick hans hahn rudolf carnap
gödel then studied number theory took part seminar run moritz schlick studied bertrand russell's book introduction mathematical philosophy became interested mathematical logic
according gödel mathematical logic science prior others contains ideas principles underlying sciences
attending lecture david hilbert bologna completeness consistency mathematical systems may set gödel's life course
1928 hilbert wilhelm ackermann published grundzüge theoretischen logik principles mathematical logic introduction first-order logic problem completeness posed axioms formal system sufficient derive every statement true models system? became topic gödel chose doctoral work
1929 age 23 completed doctoral dissertation under hans hahn's supervision
established completeness first-order predicate calculus gödel's completeness theorem
awarded doctorate 1930
thesis along additional work published vienna academy science
career incompleteness theorem kurt gödel's achievement modern logic singular monumental indeed monument landmark will remain visible far space time
subject logic certainly completely changed nature possibilities gödel's achievement
—john von neumann 1931 while still vienna gödel published incompleteness theorems über formal unentscheidbare sätze principia mathematica und verwandter systeme called english formally undecidable propositions principia mathematica related systems
article proved any computable axiomatic system powerful enough describe arithmetic natural numbers e
peano axioms zermelo–fraenkel set theory axiom choice system consistent cannot complete
consistency axioms cannot proven within system
these theorems ended half-century attempts beginning work frege culminating principia mathematica hilbert's formalism find set axioms sufficient mathematics
hindsight basic idea heart incompleteness theorem rather simple
gödel essentially constructed formula claims unprovable given formal system
provable false contradicts idea consistent system provable statements true
thus there will least true unprovable statement
any computably enumerable set axioms arithmetic set principle printed out idealized computer unlimited resources there formula true arithmetic provable system
make precise however gödel needed produce method encode natural numbers statements proofs concept provability using process known gödel numbering
two-page paper zum intuitionistischen aussagenkalkül 1932 gödel refuted finite-valuedness intuitionistic logic
proof implicitly used later become known gödel–dummett intermediate logic gödel fuzzy logic

triggered severe nervous crisis gödel
developed paranoid symptoms including fear being poisoned spent several months sanitarium nervous diseases
1933 gödel first traveled u
met albert einstein became good friend
delivered address annual meeting american mathematical society
during year gödel also developed ideas computability recursive functions point able present lecture general recursive functions concept truth
work developed number theory using gödel numbering
1934 gödel gave series lectures institute advanced study ias princeton new jersey entitled undecidable propositions formal mathematical systems
stephen kleene just completed ph princeton took notes these lectures subsequently published
gödel visited ias again autumn 1935
traveling hard work exhausted next year took break recover depressive episode
returned teaching 1937
during time worked proof consistency axiom choice continuum hypothesis went show these hypotheses cannot disproved common system axioms set theory

gödel very quickly resumed mathematical work
1940 published work consistency axiom choice generalized continuum-hypothesis axioms set theory classic modern mathematics
[citation needed] work introduced constructible universe model set theory sets exist those constructed simpler sets
gödel showed both axiom choice ac generalized continuum hypothesis gch true constructible universe therefore must consistent zermelo–fraenkel axioms set theory zf
result considerable consequences working mathematicians means assume axiom choice proving hahn-banach theorem
paul cohen later constructed model zf ac gch false together these proofs mean ac gch independent zf axioms set theory
albert einstein also living princeton during time
gödel einstein developed strong friendship known take long walks together institute advanced study

december 5 1947 einstein morgenstern accompanied gödel u
citizenship exam acted witnesses
gödel confided them discovered inconsistency u
constitution allow u
become dictatorship
einstein morgenstern concerned their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize application
fortunately judge turned out phillip forman knew einstein administered oath einstein's own citizenship hearing
everything went smoothly until forman happened ask gödel thought dictatorship like nazi regime happen u
gödel then started explain discovery forman
forman understood going cut gödel off moved hearing other questions routine conclusion
