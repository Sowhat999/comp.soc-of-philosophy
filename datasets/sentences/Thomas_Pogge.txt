particular without denying much blame should directed domestic kleptocrats pogge urges us recognize ways international institutions facilitate exacerbate corruption perpetuated national institutions
pogge especially critical “resource” “borrowing” privileges allow illegitimate political leaders sell natural resources borrow money name country people
pogge’s analysis these resource borrowing privileges international society extends oppressive rulers impoverished states play crucial causal role perpetuating absolute poverty
pogge maintains these privileges no accident persist because interest wealthy states
resource privilege helps guarantee reliable supply raw materials goods enjoyed members wealthy states borrowing privilege allows financial institutions wealthy states issue lucrative loans
may seem such loans good developing states too pogge argues practice typically work quite contrary local elites afford oppressive corrupt because foreign loans military aid stay power even without popular support
often oppressive corrupt because light prevailing extreme international inequalities far lucrative them cater interests foreign governments firms those their impoverished compatriots

poverty gender equality measurement various indices - united nations development programme's human gender‐related development indices world bank’s poverty index - used track poverty development gender equity population level
pogge argues these prominent indices deeply flawed therefore distort our moral judgments misguide resource allocations governments international agencies non-governmental organizations

both indices will draw holistic measure individual disadvantage reflects relevant aspects person’s situation
