book full vaporous french-intellectual prose makes teilhard de chardin sound like ernest hemingway comparison criticism because author likes sort prose taken lessons how write she thinks plain homely speech part conspiracy oppress poor
book clatters around dark closet irrelevancies 450 pages before bumps accidentally index stops criticism either because author finds gratifying refreshing bang unrelated facts together rebuke stuffy minds
