father principal kaisei high school
tanabe's father also scholar confucius whose teachings may influenced tanabe's philosophical religious thought
tanabe also taught english kaisei after graduating university tokyo
after graduating university kitaro nishida invited tanabe teach kyoto imperial university now kyoto university
after nishida's retirement teaching tanabe succeeded
though began friends shared several philosophical concepts such absolute nothingness tanabe became increasingly critical nishida's philosophy
many tanabe's writings after nishida left university obliquely attacked latter's philosophy
tanabe accepted position associate professor kyoto university 1919
spent two years studying germany berlin university then university freiburg 1922-1924
freiburg studied under edmund husserl tutored young heidegger
influence these two philosophers stayed tanabe throughout life much thought exhibits assumptions terminology ontology
during japanese expansion war effort tanabe worked nishida others maintain right free academic expression
though criticized nazi-inspired letter heidegger tanabe himself caught up japanese war effort letters students going off war exhibit many same terms ideology used reigning military powers
even damning essays written defense japanese racial state superiority exploiting theory logic species herald abet militaristic ideology
during war years however tanabe published little perhaps reflecting moral turmoil attests monumental post-war work philosophy metanoetics
work framed confession repentance metanoia support war effort

lived another eleven years after writing these words dying 1962 kita-karuizawa japan
thought james heisig others note tanabe other members kyoto school accepted western philosophical tradition stemming greeks
tradition attempts explain meaning human experience rational terms
sets them apart other eastern writers though thinking life means how best live good life spoke religious terms
although kyoto school used western philosophical terminology rational exploration made these items serve purpose presenting unique vision reality within their cultural heritage
specifically enrich discussion ultimate nature reality using experience thought various forms buddhism like zen pure land embedded analysis calls upon conceptual tools forged honed western philosophy thinkers ranging plato rené descartes heidegger
tanabe's own contribution dialog eastern western philosophy ultimately sets off other members kyoto school
radical critique philosophical reason method while stemming immanuel kant søren kierkegaard emerges work philosophy metanoetics easily sets off major thinker unique position perennial philosophical questions
commentators example suggest tanabe's work metanoetics forerunner deconstructionism
tanabe engaged philosophers continental philosophy especially existentialism
work often dialog philosophers like kierkegaard friedrich nietzsche heidegger
because engaging these thinkers especially first two tanabe's thought characterized existentialist though makoto ozaki writes tanabe preferred terms existentialist philosophy history historical existentialism existential metaphysics history
masterpiece philosophy metanoetics tanabe characterized work philosophy philosophy foreshadowing various approaches thinking deconstructionists
like other existentialists tanabe emphasizes importance philosophy being meaning humans think desire finding meaning life death
company other members kyoto school tanabe believed foremost problem facing humans modern world lack meaning consequent nihilism
jean-paul sartre following kierkegaard concept anxiety keen characterize nothingness
heidegger well appropriated notion nothingness later writings
kyoto school philosophers believed their contribution discussion nihilism centered buddhist-inspired concept nothingness aligned correlate sunyata
tanabe nishida attempted distinguish their philosophical use concept however calling absolute nothingess
term differentiates buddhist religious concept nothingness well underlines historical aspects human existence believed buddhism does capture
tanabe disagreed nishida nishitani meaning absolute nothingness emphasizing practical historical aspect over termed latter's intuitionism
tanabe hoped emphasize working nothingness time opposed eternal now
also wished center human experience action rather contemplation since thought action embodies concern ethics whereas contemplation ultimately disregards resulting form monism after mold plotinus georg wilhelm friedrich hegel
echoing kierkegaard's undermining philosophical fragments systematic philosophy plato baruch spinoza hegel tanabe questions whether there aboriginal condition preexisting awareness must regained attain enlightenment
tanabe's insistence point simply philosophical instead points again insistence proper mode human being action especially ethics
however critical notion pre-existing condition enlightenment because accepts kantian notion radical evil wherein humans exhibit ineluctable propensity act against their own desires good instead perpetrate evil
work demonstratio christianity tanabe's demonstratio christianity presents religion cultural entity tension existential meaning religion plays individual lives
tanabe uses terms genus represent universality form entities strive contrasting them stable though ossified form become species social systems
tanabe contraposes christianity christ represented here opposition paul jesus
jesus tanabe's terms historical being manifests action absolute nothingness god understood non-theistic terms
god beyond conceptuality human thinking occur terms self-identity being
god becomes manifested human actions though god never reduced being self-identity
tanabe humans potential realize compassionate divinity nothingness through continual death resurrection way seeing their nothingness
tanabe believes christian incarnation narrative important explaining nature reality since believed absolute nothingness becoming human exemplifies true nature divine well exemplar realization human being relationship divinity
jesus signifies process most pure form thereby setting example others follow
ultimately tanabe chooses philosophy over religion since latter tends toward socialization domestication original impulse religious action
philosophy understood metanoetics remains open questions possibility self-delusion form radical evil
therefore tanabe's statement philosophy religion
