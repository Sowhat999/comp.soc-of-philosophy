ancient sources differ whether remarried
first triumvirate after catilinian conspiracy cato turned political skills oppose designs caesar triumvirate allies pompey marcus licinius crassus among them held reins power finely balanced near-monopoly
caesar gained influence over senate through pompey crassus
pompey gained influence over legions rome through crassus caesar
crassus enjoyed support tax-farmers able gain fortune exploitation provinces controlled caesar pompey
cato's opposition took two forms
first 61 bc pompey returned asian campaign two ambitions celebrate triumph become consul second time
order achieve both goals asked senate postpone consular elections until after triumph
due pompey's enormous popularity senate willing oblige pompey first cato intervened convinced senate force pompey choose
opposition action quintus metellus celer pompey's brother-in-law attempted repeal act unsuccessful
pompey run consulship year choosing instead hold third triumph most magnificent ever seen rome
60 bc cato then attempted obstruct syndicate tax contractors province asia
syndicate's winning bid far greater syndicate able recoup through tax collection
due bid being paid advance heavy losses prompted them ask senate renegotiation thus refund fraction bid
crassus gave strong support plea cato then promptly succeeded vetoing regardless backlash terms business interests other equites
faced same request caesar cato used device filibuster speaking continuously until nightfall prevent senate voting issue whether caesar allowed stand consul absentia
thus caesar forced choose triumph run consulship
caesar chose forgo triumph entered rome time register candidate 59 bc election won
caesar's consular colleague marcus bibulus husband cato's daughter porcia
caesar became consul cato opposed agrarian laws established farmlands pompey's veterans public lands campania republic derived quarter income
caesar responded having cato dragged out lictors while cato making speech against rostra
many senators protested extraordinary unprecedented use force leaving forum senator proclaiming he'd rather jail cato senate caesar
caesar forced relent countered taking vote directly people bypassing senate
bibulus cato attempted oppose caesar public votes harassed publicly assaulted caesar's retainers
eventually bibulus confined himself home pronounced unfavorable omens attempt lay legal groundwork later repeal caesar’s consular acts
cato relent opposition triumvirs unsuccessfully attempting prevent caesar's 5-year appointment governor illyria cisalpine gaul appointment crassus eastern command
cyprus clodius worked closely triumvirate desired exile cicero felt cato's presence complicate efforts
support triumvirs proposed send cato annex cyprus
plutarch recounts cato saw commission attempt rid initially refused assignment
clodius passed legislation conferring commission cato though ever unwillingly cato accepted position compliance law
official office while cyprus quaestor pro praetore extraordinary quaestorship praetorian powers cato appeared two major goals cyprus
first enact foreign policy ideals which—as expressed letter cicero—called policy mildness uprightness governors roman-controlled territories
second implement reforms quaestorship larger scale
second goal also provided cato opportunity burnish stoic credentials province rich both gold opportunities extortion
thus against common practice cato took none prepared immaculate accounts senate much done earlier career quaestor
according plutarch cato ultimately raised enormous sum 7000 talents silver roman treasury
thought every unexpected event even tying ropes coffers big piece cork other end located event shipwreck
unfortunately luck played trick
perfect accounting books none survived burnt other lost sea freedman carrying
cato's untainted reputation saved charges extortion
senate rome recognized effort made cyprus offered reception city extraordinary praetorship other privileges stubbornly refused unlawful honours
civil war triumvirate caesar pompey crassus broken 54 bc same time cato's election praetor
judging their enemy trouble cato optimates faction senate spent coming years trying force break pompey caesar
time political turmoil popular figures like publius clodius tried advance cause common people rome going far abandoning patrician status become pleb
leading spokesman optimate cause cato stood against them defense traditional privileges aristocracy
52 bc cato ran office consul following year unsuccessfully
time rampant bribery electoral fraud ran scrupulously honest campaign lost less conscientious opponents
cato accepted loss equanimity refused run second time
49 bc cato called senate formally relieve caesar expired proconsular command order caesar's return rome civilian thus without proconsular legal immunity
pompey blocked previous attempts ordering caesar back rome grown concerned caesar's growing political influence popularity plebs
tacit support pompey cato successfully passed resolution ending caesar's proconsular command
caesar made numerous attempts negotiate point even conceding give up provinces legions
concession satisfied pompey cato along consul lentulus refused back down
faced alternatives returning rome inevitable trial retiring voluntary exile caesar crossed italy legion implicitly declaring war senate
caesar crossed rubicon accompanied xiii legion take power senate same way sulla done past
formally declared enemy state caesar pursued senatorial party now led pompey abandoned city raise arms greece cato among companions
after first reducing caesar's army battle dyrrhachium cato commanded port army led pompey ultimately defeated caesar battle pharsalus 48 bc
cato metellus scipio however concede defeat escaped province africa fifteen cohorts continue resistance utica
caesar pursued cato metellus scipio after installing queen cleopatra vii throne egypt february 46 bc outnumbered caesarian legions defeated army led metellus scipio battle thapsus
acting against usual strategy clemency caesar accept surrender scipio's troops them slaughtered
death utica cato participate battle unwilling live world led caesar refusing even implicitly grant caesar power pardon committed suicide april 46 bc
according plutarch cato attempted kill himself stabbing himself own sword failed due injured hand
plutarch cato immediately die wound struggling fell off bed throwing down little mathematical table stood made such noise servants hearing cried out
immediately son friends came chamber seeing lie weltering own blood great part bowels out body himself still alive able look them stood horror
physician went put bowels pierced sewed up wound cato recovering himself understanding intention thrust away physician plucked out own bowels tearing open wound immediately expired
hearing death utica plutarch caesar commented cato grudge you your death you grudged me preservation your life
starting pliny elder later writers sometimes refer cato younger cato uticensis utican
doing apply type cognomen normally awarded generals earned triumph foreign war brought large territory under roman influence e
scipio africanus
such names honorific titles senate granted most spectacular victories
reference cato uticensis presumably meant glorify portraying suicide utica great victory over caesar's tyranny
after cato romans cato upheld strong traditional roman principles remembered particularly well
suicide seen symbol those followed conservative optimate principles traditional roman
cato remembered follower stoicism most active defenders republic
roman interpretation stoicism somewhat odds greeks
although greek stoicism generally argued against participation public affairs romans able incorporate stoic teachings their civic framework
cato's high moral standards incorruptible virtue gained several followers—of whom marcus favonius most well known—as well praise even political enemies such sallust our sources anecdote caesar cato's sister
sallust also comparison cato caesar cato's long-time rival—caesar praised mercy compassion generosity while cato discipline rigidity moral integrity
should however consider these men sallust found appealing
after cato's death both pro- anti-cato treatises appeared amongst them cicero panegyric entitled cato caesar never forgave obstructions answered anti-cato
caesar's pamphlet survived contents may inferred plutarch's life cato also repeats many stories caesar put forward anti-cato
plutarch specifically mentions accounts cato's close friend munatius rufus later neronian senator thrasea paetus references used parts biography cato
whilst caesar proclaimed clemency towards never forgave cato
stance something others anti-caesarian camp remember including cato's nephew posthumous son-in-law brutus
republicans under empire remembered fondly poet virgil writing under augustus made cato hero aeneid[citation needed]
whilst particularly safe praise cato augustus tolerate appreciate cato
whilst might argue heaping posthumous praise cato highlights one's opposition new shape rome without directly challenging augustus actually later generations able embrace role model cato without fear prosecution
certainly under nero resurgence republican ambitions cato their ideal ended death such figures like seneca lucan cato continued nevertheless righteous ideal generations come
lucan writing under nero also made cato hero later books epic pharsalia
latter work originates epigram victrix causa deis placuit sed victa catoni conquering cause pleased gods conquered cause pleased cato lucan
other imperial authors such horace tiberian authors velleius paterculus valerius maximus along lucan seneca st century ad later authors such appian dio celebrated historical importance cato younger their own writings
