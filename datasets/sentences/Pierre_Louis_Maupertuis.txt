father renė involved number enterprises central monarchy thrived socially politically
son educated mathematics private tutor nicolas guisnée upon completing formal education father secured largely honorific cavalry commission
after three years cavalry during time became acquainted fashionable social mathematical circles moved paris began building reputation mathematician literary wit
1723 admitted académie des sciences
early mathematical work revolved around vis viva controversy maupertuis developed extended work isaac newton whose theories yet widely accepted outside england argued against waning cartesian mechanics
1730 s shape earth became flashpoint battle among rival systems mechanics
maupertuis based exposition newton help mentor johan bernoulli predicted earth should oblate while rival jacques cassini measured astronomically prolate
1736 maupertuis acted chief french geodesic mission sent king louis xv lapland measure length degree arc meridian
results published book detailing procedures essentially settled controversy favor
book included adventure narrative expedition account käymäjärvi inscriptions
return home became member almost scientific societies europe
maupertuis'opinion cassini'sopinion after lapland expedition maupertuis set generalizing earlier mathematical work proposing principle least action metaphysical principle underlies laws mechanics
also expanded biological realm anonymously publishing book part popular science part philosophy part erotica vénus physique
work maupertuis proposed theory generation
reproduction organic matter possessed self-organizing “intelligence” analogous contemporary chemical concept affinities widely read commented upon favorably georges-louis leclerc comte de buffon
later developed views living things further formal pseudonymous work explored heredity collecting evidence confirmed contributions both sexes treated variations statistical phenomena
1740 maupertuis went berlin invitation frederick ii prussia took part battle mollwitz taken prisoner austrians
release returned berlin thence paris elected director academy sciences 1742 following year admitted académie française
returning berlin 1744 again desire frederick ii chosen president royal prussian academy sciences 1746 controlled help leonhard euler until death
position became extremely awkward outbreak seven years' war home country patron's reputation suffered both paris berlin
finding health declining retired 1757 south france went 1758 basel died year later
maupertuis' difficult disposition involved constant quarrels controversies samuel könig voltaire during latter part life examples
brilliance much undermined tendency leave work unfinished failure realise own potential
insight genius led least-action principle lack intellectual energy rigour prevented giving mathematical foundation lagrange provide
reveals remarkable powers perception heredity understanding mechanism species developed even immunology no fully elaborated theory
philosophical work most enthralling bold exciting well argued
evolution historians science point work biology significant precursor development evolutionary theory specifically theory natural selection
other writers contend remarks cursory vague incidental particular argument
mayr's verdict neither evolutionist nor founders theory natural selection [but] pioneers genetics
maupertuis espoused theory pangenesis postulating particles both mother father responsible characters child
bowler credits studies heredity natural origin human races idea forms life may changed time
maupertuis strong critic natural theologians pointing phenomena incompatible concept good wise creator
also first consider animals terms variable populations opposition natural history tradition emphasized description individual specimens
difficulty interpreting maupertius gauged reading original works
below translation vénus physique followed original french passage say fortuitous combinations productions nature there must characterized certain relation fitness able subsist wondered fitness present species currently existence? chance say produced innumerable multitude individuals small number found themselves constructed such manner parts animal able satisfy needs another infinitely greater number there neither fitness nor order these latter perished
animals lacking mouth live others lacking reproductive organs perpetuate themselves
species see today smallest part blind destiny produced
— ne pourrait-on pas dire que dans combinaison fortuite des productions de nature comme il n'y avait que celles où se trouvaient certain rapport de convenance qui puissent subsister il n'est pas marveilleux que cette convenance se trouve dans toutes les espèces qui existent actuellement? le hasard dirait-on avait produit une multitude innombrable d'individus un petit nombre se trouvait construit de manière que les parties de l'animal pouvaient satisfaire à ses besoins dans un autre infiniment plus grand il n'y avait ni convenance ni ordre tous ces derniers ont péri des animaux sans bouche ne pouvaient pas vivre d'autres qui manquaient d'organes pour génération ne pouvaient se perpétuer
les espèces que nous voyons aujourd'hui ne sont que plus petite partie de ce qu'un destin aveugle avait produit
nearly identical argument may found maupertuis' 1746 work les loix du mouvement et du repos déduites d'un principe metaphysique translation derivation laws motion equilibrium metaphysical principle
king-hele 1963 points similar though identical ideas thirty years later david hume dialogues concerning natural religion 1777
chief debate maupertuis engaged treated competing theories generation
preformationism epigenesis
account life involved spontaneous generation new kinds animals plants together massive elimination deficient forms
these ideas avoid need creator part modern thinking evolution
date these speculations 1745 concurrent carl linnaeus's own work predates any firm notion species
also work genealogy coupled tracing phenotypic characters through lineages foreshadows later work done genetics
least action principle principle least action states natural phenomena quantity called ‘action’ tends minimized
maupertuis developed such principle over two decades
action expressed mathematically product mass body involved distance traveled velocity traveling
1741 gave paper paris academy sciences loi du repos des corps law bodies rest
showed system bodies rest tends reach position any change create smallest possible change quantity argued assimilated action
1744 another paper paris academy gave accord de plusieurs lois naturelles qui avaient paru jusqu’ici incompatibles agreement several natural laws hitherto seemed incompatible show behaviour light during refraction bends entering new medium such total path followed point first medium point second minimised quantity again assimilated action
finally 1746 gave further paper loix du mouvement et du repos laws movement rest time berlin academy sciences showed point masses also minimise action
point masses bodies treated purposes analysis being certain amount matter mass concentrated single point
major debate early part eighteenth century concerned behaviour such bodies collisions
cartesian newtonian physicists argued their collisions point masses conserved both momentum relative velocity
leibnizians other hand argued also conserved called live force vis viva
unacceptable their opponents two reasons first live force conservation apply so-called ‘hard’ bodies bodies totally incompressible whereas other two conservation principles second live force defined product mass square velocity
why velocity appear twice quantity squaring suggests? leibnizians argued simple enough there natural tendency matter towards motion even rest there inherent velocity bodies begin move there second velocity term corresponding their actual motion
anathema cartesians newtonians
inherent tendency towards motion ‘occult quality’ kind favoured mediaeval scholastics resisted costs
today course concept ‘hard’ body rejected
mass times square velocity just twice kinetic energy modern mechanics reserves major role inheritor quantity ‘live force’
maupertuis however important retain concept hard body
beauty principle least action applied just well hard elastic bodies
since shown principle also applied systems bodies rest light seemed truly universal
final stage argument came maupertuis set out interpret principle cosmological terms
‘least action’ sounds like economy principle roughly equivalent idea economy effort daily life
universal principle economy effort seem display working wisdom very construction universe
seems maupertuis’s view powerful argument existence infinitely wise creator any other advanced
published thinking these matters essai de cosmologie essay cosmology 1750
shows major arguments advanced prove god wonders nature apparent regularity universe open objection wonder there existence certain particularly repulsive insects regularity there observation planets turn nearly same plane exactly same plane might striking 'nearly same plane' far less convincing
universal principle wisdom provides undeniable proof shaping universe wise creator
hence principle least action just culmination maupertuis’s work several areas physics sees most important achievement philosophy too giving incontrovertible proof god
flaws reasoning principally there no obvious reason why product mass velocity distance should particularly viewed corresponding action even less reason why minimisation should ‘economy’ principle like minimisation effort
indeed product mass velocity distance mathematically equivalent integral live force over time
leibniz already shown quantity likely either minimised maximised natural phenomena
minimising quantity conceivably demonstrate economy how maximising it? see also corresponding principles stationary actions lagrange hamilton
relation kant arthur schopenhauer suggested immanuel kant's most important brilliant doctrine - contained critique pure reason 1781 - asserted maupertuis say find kant's most important brilliant doctrine ideality space merely phenomenal existence corporeal world expressed already thirty years previously maupertuis?
maupertuis expresses paradoxical doctrine decidedly yet without addition proof must supposed also obtained somewhere else
