carneades left no writings known lectures derived intimate friend pupil clitomachus true own principles withholding assent clitomachus confesses never ascertain master really thought any subject
[citation needed] ethics particularly subject long laborious study seems denied conformity moral ideas nature
particularly insisted second oration justice manifestly wished convey own notions subject there maintains ideas justice derived nature purely artificial purposes expediency
[citation needed] however nothing special application general theory people possess never possess any criterion truth
carneades argued there criterion must exist either reason logos sensation aisthêsis conception phantasia
then reason itself depends conception again sensation no means judging whether our sensations true false whether correspond objects produce them carry wrong impressions mind producing false conceptions ideas leading reason also error
therefore sensation conception reason alike disqualified being criterion truth
[citation needed] after people must live act must rule practical life therefore although impossible pronounce anything absolutely true may yet establish probabilities various degrees
although cannot say any given conception sensation itself true yet sensations appear us true others must guided seems most true
again sensations single generally combined others either confirm contradict them greater combination greater probability being true rest combine confirm case greatest number conceptions each themselves apparently most true should combine affirm also itself appears most true present carneades highest probability nearest approach truth
