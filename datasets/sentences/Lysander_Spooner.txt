most famous work book titled unconstitutionality slavery published 1845
spooner's book contributed controversy among abolitionists over whether united states constitution supported institution slavery
disunionist faction led william lloyd garrison wendell phillips argued constitution legally recognized enforced oppression slaves example provisions capture fugitive slaves article iv section 2
also cited frequent appeals constitutional compromise southern politicians insisted protection peculiar institution part sectional compromise constitution based
[citation needed] disunionists thus argued keeping free states political union slave states made citizens free states complicit slave system denounced constitution covenant death agreement hell
generally wendell phillips disputed spooner's notion any unjust law should held legally void judges
spooner challenged claim text constitution permitted slavery
although recognized founders probably intended outlaw slavery writing constitution argued meaning text private intentions writers enforceable
spooner used complex system legal natural law arguments order show clauses usually interpreted supporting slavery fact support several clauses constitution prohibited states establishing slavery
spooner's arguments cited other pro-constitution abolitionists such gerrit smith liberty party adopted official text 1848 platform
frederick douglass originally garrisonian disunionist later came accept pro-constitution position cited spooner's arguments explain change mind
publication book until 1861 spooner actively campaigned against slavery
published subsequent pamphlets jury nullification other legal defenses escaped slaves offered legal services often free charge fugitives
late 1850 s copies book distributed members congress sparking debate over their contents
even senator albert gallatin brown mississippi slavery proponent praised argument's intellectual rigor conceded most formidable legal challenge seen abolitionists date
1858 spooner circulated plan abolition slavery calling use guerrilla warfare against slaveholders black slaves non-slaveholding free southerners aid northern abolitionists
spooner also conspir[ed] john brown promote servile insurrection south participated aborted plot free brown after capture following failed raid harper's ferry virginia harper's ferry now part state west virginia
1860 spooner actively courted william seward support fledgling republican party
[citation needed] admitted sympathizer jeffersonian political philosophy spooner adamantly refused request soon became outspoken abolitionist critic party
spooner republicans hypocrites purporting oppose slavery's expansion refusing take strong consistent moral stance against slavery itself
although spooner advocated use violence abolish slavery denounced republicans' use violence prevent southern states seceding during american civil war
published several letters pamphlets war arguing republican objective eradicate slavery rather preserve union force
blamed bloodshed republican political leaders such secretary state william h
seward senator charles sumner often criticized slavery attack constitutional basis pursued military policies seen vengeful abusive
although denounced institution slavery spooner recognized right confederate states america secede manifestation government consent constitutional legal principle fundamental spooner's philosophy northern states contrast trying deny southerners right through military force
vociferously opposed civil war arguing violated right southern states secede union no longer represented them
believed attempting restore southern states union against wishes southerners
argued right states secede derives natural right slaves free
argument unpopular north south after war began conflicted official position both governments
views economics self-employment spooner believed beneficial people self-employed enjoy full benefits their labor rather having share them employer
argued various forms government intervention free market made difficult people start their own businesses
believed laws against high interest rates usury prevented those capital extending credit because compensated high risks being repaid man capital own upon bestow labor necessary allowed obtain credit
order may able obtain credit necessary allowed contract such rate interest will induce man having surplus capital loan capitalist cannot consistently natural law compelled loan capital against will
legislative restraints upon rate interest therefore nothing less arbitrary tyrannical restraints upon man's natural capacity amid natural right hire capital upon bestow labor
effect usury laws then give monopoly right borrowing money those few offer most approved security
spooner also believed government restrictions issuance private money made inordinately difficult individuals obtain capital credit start their own businesses thereby putting them situation very large portion them save themselves starvation no alternative sell their labor others those employ others able afford pay far below laborers produce [than] themselves necessary capital work
spooner there prohibitory tax tax ten per cent
notes issued circulation money other notes united states national banks argued caused artificial shortage credit eliminating tax result making plenty money available lending such great establishments every kind now hands few proprietors employing great number wage labourers broken up few no persons hire capital business themselves consent labour wages another

though approved abolition slavery criticized north failing make purpose their cause
instead fighting abolish slavery fought preserve union according spooner associate business interests union
spooner believed war type hypocritical dishonest especially part radical republicans like sumner then claiming abolitionist heroes ending slavery
spooner also argued war came great cost liberty proved rights expressed declaration independence no longer true people dissolve political bands tie them government becomes destructive consent governed because spooner believed south attempted their obedience former government enforced military action
union government's actions during war caused spooner espouse individualist anarchism
published series political tracts no treason most famous no treason no
vi constitution no authority
lengthy essay spooner argued constitution contract government see social contract theory logically apply anyone other individuals signed thus void
furthermore since government now existing under constitution pursued coercive policies contrary natural law consent governed demonstrated document adequately stop many abuses against liberty prevent tyranny
spooner bolstered argument noting federal government established legal contract legally bind persons living nation since none ever signed their names given their consent consent assumed fails most basic burdens proof valid contract courtroom
