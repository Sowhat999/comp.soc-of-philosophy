ideas arguments views philosophy religion midgley argued philosophy like plumbing something nobody notices until goes wrong
then suddenly become aware bad smells take up floorboards look concepts even most ordinary piece thinking
great philosophers
noticed how badly things going wrong made suggestions how dealt
despite her upbringing she embrace christianity herself because she says couldn't make work
try pray didn't seem get me anywhere stopped after while
think it's perfectly sensible world view
she also argues world's religions should simply ignored turns out evils infested religion confined ones accompany any successful human institution
nor even clear religion itself something human race either should cured
midgley's book wickedness 1984 described coming closest addressing theological theme problem evil
midgley argues need understand human capacity wickedness rather blaming god
midgley argues evil arises aspects human nature external force
she further argues evil absence good good being described positive virtues such generosity courage kindness
therefore evil absence these characteristics leading selfishness cowardice similar
she therefore criticises existentialism other schools thought promote 'rational will' free agent
she also criticises tendency demonise those deemed 'wicked' failing acknowledge also display measure virtues
midgley also expressed her interest paul davies' ideas inherent improbability order found universe
she argues there's sort tendency towards formation order including towards life perceptive life
best way she argues talking using concept life force although she acknowledges vague
she also argues gratitude important part motivation theism
you go out day like you're really grateful
don't know
understanding also links midgley's argument concept gaia both scientific religious aspect
she argues people find hard grasp because our views both science religion narrowed much connections them now obscured
however belief personal god instead responding system life revealed gaia wonder awe gratitude gaia philosophy midgley supporter james lovelock's gaia hypothesis
part her principal passion reviving our reverence earth
midgley also described gaia breakthrough first time theory derived scientific measurements carried implicit moral imperative need act interests living system depend
2001 midgley founded along david midgley tom wakeford gaia network became first chair
their regular meetings implications gaia led 2007 book earthy realism edited midgley sought bring together scientific spiritual aspects gaia theory
midgley's 2001 pamphlet demos gaia next big idea argues importance idea gaia powerful tool science morality psychology politics gain holistic understanding world
instead midgley argues must learn how value various aspects our environment how structure social relationships institutions value social spiritual life well natural world alongside commercial economic aspects
her book science poetry also published 2001 also includes discussion idea gaia she argues gratuitous semi-mystical fantasy instead useful idea cure distortions spoil our current world-view
useful both finding practical solutions environmental problems also giving us realistic view ourselves
gaia midgely argues both scientific moral importance also involves politics
there also religious angle gaia
reductionism materialism midgley's first book beast man published she her late fifties
beast man examination human nature reaction against reductionism sociobiology relativism behaviorism she saw prevalent much social science
she argued human beings similar animals many social scientists then acknowledged while animals many ways sophisticated often accepted
she criticised existentialists argued there no such thing human nature writers such desmond morris she understood arguing human nature brutal nasty
instead she argued human beings their relationship animals better understood using qualitative methods ethology comparative psychology approach showed nature it's much middle
writing 2002 introduction reprint evolution religion 1985 midgley reports she both book later science salvation 1992 counter quasi-scientific speculation certain remarkable prophetic metaphysical passages appeared suddenly scientific books often their last chapters
evolution religion dealt theories evolutionary biologists including dawkins while science salvation dealt theories physicists artificial intelligence researchers
midgley writes she still believes these theories nothing any reputable theory evolution will solve real social moral problems world facing either through genetic engineering use machines
she concludes these schemes still seem me just displacement activities proposed order avoid facing our real difficulties
[i]n exposing these rhetorical attempts turn science comprehensive ideology she myths live am attacking science defending against dangerous misconstructions
midgley argues against reductionism attempt impose any approach understanding world
she suggests there many maps many windows arguing need scientific pluralism—the recognition there many independent forms sources knowledge—rather reductivism conviction fundamental form underlies them settles everything
she writes helpful think world huge aquarium
cannot see whole above peer through number small windows
eventually make quite lot sense habitat patiently put together data different angles
insist our own window worth looking through shall get very far
she argues acknowledging matter somehow akin penetrated mind adding new
becoming aware something doing already
she suggests topic essentially caused einstein often remark really surprising thing science works
simple observation laws thought turn out laws things
midgley her 2014 book you illusion? response francis crick's argument book astonishing hypothesis person's sense personal identity free will no behaviour nerve cells
she attacks understanding inherent argument everything including sense self understood through physical properties
instead she argues there different levels explanation need studied using different methods
means thoughts memories integral part reality both humans animals need studied such

mackie published article entitled law jungle moral alternatives principles evolution praising dawkins's selfish gene discussing how ideas might applied moral philosophy
midgley responded volume 54 1979 gene-juggling arguing selfish gene psychological egoism rather evolution
paper criticised dawkins' concepts judged targets intemperate personal tone having misunderstood dawkins' ideas
midgley disputed view arguing while dawkins purports talking genes—that chemical arrangements—he nonetheless slides over saying born selfish selfish gene p
she she previously attended dawkins thinking unnecessary 'break butterfly upon wheel'
mr mackie's article indication lately met serious attention being paid fantasies
rejoinder 1981 dawkins retorted comment hard match reputable journals patronising condescension toward fellow academic
she raises art misunderstanding dizzy heights
my central point no connection she alleges
am even very directly interested man least emotional nature
my book evolution life ethics particular rather aberrant species
volume 58 1983 midgley replied again selfish genes social darwinism apology due delay impatient tone my article
should lose one's temper doing makes confused argument
[but] [m]y basic objections remain
bad feeling dawkins midgley appeared diminish
note page 55 2 nd edition selfish gene 1989 dawkins refers her highly intemperate vicious paper
midgley continued criticise dawkins' ideas
her books evolution religion 2002 myths live 2003 she writes she sees confused use language—the sleight hand involved using terms such selfish different ways without alerting reader change meaning—and she regards rhetoric genes exert ultimate power over behaviour she argues akin religion science
she letter guardian 2005 [there is] widespread discontent neo-darwinist—or dawkinsist—orthodoxy claims something darwin himself denied namely natural selection sole exclusive cause evolution making world therefore important sense entirely random

april 2009 midgley reiterated her critical interpretation selfish gene part series articles hobbes guardian
her 2010 book solitary self darwin selfish gene she argues simple one-sided accounts human motives such selfish gene tendency recent neo-darwinian thought may illuminating unrealistic
midgley art midgley referred lives animals 1999 unusual fictional work south african novelist j
book likened cross short story philosophical dialogue coetzee's protagonist elizabeth costello often speaks length philosophical ideas
many reviewers expressed bafflement text enigmatic riddling style
reviewer noted reader quite sure whether intended spot confusion contradiction non-sequitur [the protagonist's] arguments
other critics however noted many affinities lives animals midgley's philosophy used midgley's ideas make sense coetzee's famously confusing work
main character also appears coetzee's novel elizabeth costello concerned moral status animals subject midgley addressed animals why matter discusses length idea sympathy ethical concept subject midgley beast man
andy lamey result these other similarities coetzee's work evoke[s] particular conception ethics very similar philosopher mary midgley
such view affords central role sympathy fundamentally opposed long-standing rival view most clearly exemplified social contract tradition prioritizes instrumental conception rationality
coetzee midgley additionally share longstanding fascination robinson crusoe
