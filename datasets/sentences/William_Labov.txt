language use narrative analysis oral versions personal experience labov joshua waletzky takes sociolinguistic approach examining how language works people
significant because contextualizes study structure form connecting purpose method
stated purpose isolate elements narrative
work focuses exclusively oral narratives
labov describes narrative having two functions referential evaluative referential functions orienting grounding story contextual world referencing events sequential order originally occurred evaluative functions describing storyteller’s purpose telling story
formally analyzing data orally-generated texts obtained via observed group interaction interview 600 interviews taken several studies whose participants included ethnically diverse groups children adults various backgrounds labov divides narrative five six sections abstract - gives overview story
orientation - labov describes referential [free clauses which] serve orient listener respect person place time behavioral situation
specifies these contextual clues precede main story
complication main story during narrative unfolds
story may consist multiple complication sections
evaluation - author evinces self-awareness giving explicit implicit purpose retelling story
thus evaluation gives indication significance author attributes his/her story
evaluation done subtly instance lexical intensifiers [are type of] semantically defined evaluation
resolution occurs sequentially following evaluation
resolution may give story sense completion
coda - returns listener present drawing them back out world story world storytelling event
coda essential narrative narratives coda
while every narrative includes these elements purpose subdivision show narratives inherent structural order
labov argues narrative units must retell events order experienced because narrative temporally sequenced
other words events occur random connected another thus “the original semantic interpretation” depends their original order
demonstrate sequence breaks story down basic parts
defines narrative clause basic unit narrative around everything else built
clauses distinguished another temporal junctures indicate shift time separate narrative clauses
temporal junctures mark temporal sequencing because clauses cannot rearranged without disrupting their meaning
labov waletzky’s findings important because derived them actual data rather abstract theorization descriptive rather prescriptive approach
labov waletzky &c
set up interview situations documented speech patterns storytelling keeping ethnographic tradition tape recording oral text referenced exactly
inductive method creates new system through understand story text
scholarly influence criticism labov’s seminal work referenced critically examined number scholars mainly structural rigidity
kristin langellier explains “the purpose labovian analysis relate formal properties narrative their functions” clause-level analysis how text affects transmission message
model several flaws langellier points out examines textual structure exclusion context audience often act shape text real-time it’s relevant specific demographic may difficult extrapolate categorizing text clausal level burdens analysis theoretical distinctions may illuminating practice
anna de fina remarks [within labov’s model] “the defining property narrative temporal sequence since order events presented narrative expected match original events occurred…” differs contemporary notions storytelling naturally time-conscious flow include jumping forward back through time mandated example anxieties felt concerning futures their interplay subsequent decisions
de fina langellier both note though wonderfully descriptive labov’s model nevertheless difficult code thus potentially limited application/practice
de fina also agrees langellier labov’s model ignores complex often quite relevant subject intertextuality narrative
extent labov evinces awareness these concerns saying “it clear these conclusions restricted speech communities examined” “the overall structure narratives we’ve examined uniform”
“rethinking ventriloquism” diane goldstein uses labovian notions tellability—internal coherence narrative—to inform her concept untellability
