liberation theology nash editor liberation theology well contributors
book argues liberation theology consists 3 claims
christians ought become politically active behalf poor oppressed
major cause poverty oppression world capitalism
christians should attack capitalism see replaced socialism
nash agrees first claim argues attacking capitalism seeing replaced socialism will achieve precisely opposite goals sought out liberation theologians arguing socialism means liberation both tragic ironic
liberation theologians rejected system offers real economic hope masses wish assist
instead taken path will deny their people food also deprive them liberty due socialism's central control
such movement should call itself liberation theology truly ironic
socialism nash states majority academics day strong bias against capitalism
people blamed capitalism nearly every evil contemporary society including greed selfishness materialism fraudulent behavior debasement society's tastes pollution environment alienation despair vast disparities wealth
even racism sexism treated effects capitalism
nash argued criticisms capitalism really just slogans unsupported anything resembling evidence
undesirable feature noted alleged capitalistic society market economy supposedly functions
then simply asserted capitalism cause problem
known logic fallacy false cause
mere coincidence does prove casual connection
such critics capitalism conveniently overlook fact features capitalist societies find offensive also exist socialist societies
socialism umbrella term often referring economies centralized control
nash argued main flaw forms socialism recognized 1920 s ludwig von mises
mises argued fully centrally controlled economy never attune people want unless there free market
without markets there no way doing cost accounting
without cost accounting there no way determine whether good's value worth cost production
results chaos economy
way socialist countries able avoid collapse through monitoring pricing information existing free markets then applying information set prices their own economies
great paradox socialism fact socialism needs capitalism order survive
unless socialist economies allow free markets provide pricing information possible socialist economies soon collapse
von mises' claims strengthened fact exactly happened cases such soviet union socialist states attempted abolish markets
result no socialism practice dispense market exchanges
consequently socialism attacks market same time forced utilize market process
mixed economy sometimes called interventionism mixed economy compromise mix capitalism socialism
most countries identify capitalist socialist really different degrees mixed economy
nash argues there never sustainable mixed economy
any economy tries mix socialism capitalism will inevitably collapse two
christian left nash critic christian left particularly jim wallis ron sider tony campolo
argues group good intentions helping poor flawed economic theory
states criticisms generally leveled against capitalism fact criticisms government intrusion market activities
argues economic exchanges come two varieties peaceful means violent means
former stated you something good me will something good you
latter stated you something good me will something bad you
government intervention economy such income taxes part latter system former
states socialism definition cannot voluntary since under socialism capital either owned controlled state
nash states problem system shuts off important signals entrepreneurs might otherwise use making economic decisions
government owns land labor utilities factory other factors production becomes impossible tell how much costs produce good service
soviet union able function because sent spies capitalist nations obtain pricing information
capitalism nash argues economic anarchy
states capitalism system voluntary relationships protect people's rights against force fraud theft violations contract
nash states christian left argues capitalism encourages greed
nash retorts capitalism mechanism neutralizes greed forces people find ways serving needs those whom wish exchange
long greedy people prohibited introducing force fraud theft exchange process long cannot secure special privileges state under interventionist socialist arrangements their greed must channeled discovery products services people willing trade
jim wallis nash criticized jim wallis celebrating wallis called american defeat vietnam war
while wallis identified anti-war wallis criticized those protested against north vietnamese military campaign human rights violations
nash writes wallis's response cambodian communists' slaughter two million men women children deny bloodbath blame whatever else might happen united states
wallis nash argues same soviet union refusing condemn soviet invasion afghanistan instead believing america posed greatest threat world peace
nash argued despite claiming moderate wallis actually holds marxist worldview since wallis argued document road damascus anti-communist christians members forces darkness should convert marxism
ron sider according nash ron sider influenced leadership evangelical christian colleges
college president stated publicly hire any faculty school sympathy sider's position rich christians age hunger
