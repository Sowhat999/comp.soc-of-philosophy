revolution arendt presents comparison two main revolutions eighteenth century american french revolutions
she goes against common view both marxist leftist views she argues france while well studied often emulated disaster largely ignored american revolution success
turning point french revolution occurred leaders rejected their goals freedom order focus compassion masses
america founding fathers never betray goal constitutio libertatis
however arendt believes revolutionary spirit those men lost advocates “council system” appropriate institution regain spirit
violence arendt's essay violence distinguishes violence power
she maintains although theorists both left right regard violence extreme manifestation power two concepts fact antithetical
power comes collective will does need violence achieve any goals since voluntary compliance takes place
governments start losing their legitimacy violence becomes artificial means toward same end therefore found absence power
bureaucracies then become ideal birthplaces violence since defined rule no against whom argue therefore recreate missing links people rule over

arendt's critique human rights origins totalitarianism hannah arendt devotes lengthy chapter critical analysis human rights
arendt isn’t skeptical notion political rights general instead defends national civil conception rights
human rights rights man commonly called universal inalienable possessed simply virtue being human
contrast civil rights possessed virtue belonging political community most commonly being citizen
arendt’s primary criticism human rights ineffectual illusory because their enforcement tension national sovereignty
she argued since there no political authority above sovereign nations state governments little incentive respect human rights such policies conflict national interests
seen most clearly examining treatment refugees other stateless people
since refugee no state secure their civil rights rights fall back human rights
way arendt uses refugee test case examining human rights isolation civil rights
arendt’s analysis draws refugee upheavals first half 20 th century along her own experience refugee fleeing nazi germany
she argued state governments began emphasize national identity prerequisite full legal status number minority resident aliens increased along number stateless persons whom no state willing legally recognize
two potential solutions refugee problem repatriation naturalization both proved incapable solving crisis
arendt argued repatriation failed solve refugee crisis because no government willing take them claim them their own
refugees forcibly deported neighboring countries such immigration deemed illegal receiving country failed change fundamental status migrants stateless
attempts naturalizing assimilating refugees also little success
primarily due resistance both state governments majority citizens since both tended see refugees undesirables threatened their national identity
resistance naturalization also came refugees themselves resisted assimilation attempted maintain their own ethnic national identities
arendt contends neither naturalization nor tradition asylum capable handling sheer amount refugees
instead accepting refugees legal status state often responded denaturalizing minorities shared national ethnic ties stateless refugees
arendt argues consistent mistreatment refugees most whom placed internment camps evidence against existence human rights
notion human rights universal inalienable taken seriously must realizable given features modern liberal state
arendt contends realizable because tension least feature liberal state national sovereignty
primary ways nation exercises sovereignty through control over national borders
state governments consistently grant their citizens free movement traverse national borders
contrast movement refugees often restricted name national interests
presents dilemma liberalism liberal theorists typically committed both human rights existence sovereign nations
legacy intended third volume life mind arendt planning engage faculty judgment appropriating kant's critique judgment however she live write
