epictetus maintains foundation philosophy self-knowledge conviction our ignorance gullibility ought first subject our study
logic provides valid reasoning certainty judgment subordinate practical needs
first most necessary part philosophy concerns application doctrine example people should lie second concerns reasons e
why people should lie while third lastly examines establishes reasons
logical part finds reasons shows reason given reason right
last part necessary account second again rendered necessary first
both discourses enchiridion begin distinguishing those things our power prohairetic things those things our power aprohairetic things
alone our power our own work class our opinions impulses desires aversions
contrary our power our bodies possessions glory power
any delusion point leads greatest errors misfortunes troubles slavery soul
no power over external things good ought object our earnest pursuit found within ourselves
determination good good made capacity choice prohairesis
prohairesis allows us act gives us kind freedom rational animals
determined our reason our faculties sees tests itself everything else
right use impressions phantasia bombard mind our power practise then start say every harsh impression you impression thing you appear
then examine test these rules you firstly chiefly whether impression things up us those things up us ready reply nothing me
will troubled any loss will say ourselves such occasion lost nothing belongs me something mine torn me something my power left me
nothing beyond use our opinion properly ours
every possession rests opinion
cry weep? opinion
misfortune quarrel complaint? these things opinions opinions founded delusion subject our own choice either good evil cannot
rejecting these opinions seeking good evil power choice alone may confidently achieve peace mind every condition life
reason alone good irrational evil irrational intolerable rational
good person should labour chiefly their own reason perfect our power
repel evil opinions good noble contest humans should engage easy task promises true freedom peace mind ataraxia divine command over emotions apatheia
should especially our guard against opinion pleasure because apparent sweetness charms
first object philosophy therefore purify mind
epictetus teaches preconceptions prolepsis good evil common
good alone profitable desired evil hurtful avoided
different opinions arise application these preconceptions particular cases then darkness ignorance blindly maintains correctness own opinion must dispelled
people entertain different conflicting opinions good their judgment particular good people frequently contradict themselves
philosophy should provide standard good evil
process greatly facilitated because mind works mind alone our power whereas external things aid life beyond our control
essence god goodness good given us
gods too gave us soul reason measured breadth depth knowledge sentiments attain greatness may equal even gods
should therefore cultivate mind special care
wish nothing god wills shall truly free will come pass us according our desire shall little subject restraint zeus himself
every individual connected rest world universe fashioned universal harmony
wise people therefore will pursue merely their own will will also subject rightful order world
should conduct ourselves through life fulfilling our duties children siblings parents citizens
our country friends ought ready undergo perform greatest difficulties
good person able foresee future peacefully contentedly help bring their own sickness maiming even death knowing right order universe
certain part play world done enough performed our nature allows
exercise our powers may become aware destiny intended fulfill
like travellers inn guests stranger's table whatever offered take thankfulness sometimes turn comes may refuse former case worthy guest gods latter appear sharer their power
anyone finds life intolerable free quit should abandon our appointed role without sufficient reason
stoic sage will never find life intolerable will complain no either god human
those go wrong should pardon treat compassion since ignorance err being blind
our opinions principles render us unhappy ignorant person finds fault another
every desire degrades us renders us slaves desire
ought forget transitory character external advantages even midst our enjoyment them bear mind our own therefore properly belong us
thus prepared shall never carried away opinions
final entry enchiridion handbook begins upon occasions ought these maxims ready hand conduct me zeus thou o destiny wherever thy decree fixed my lot
follow willingly wicked wretched follow still
