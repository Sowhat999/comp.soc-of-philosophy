evolution culture 1960 touched areas cultural evolution neoevolutionism
divided evolution societies general specific
general evolution tendency cultural social systems increase complexity organization adaptiveness environment

contributions economic anthropology stone age economics 1972 collects sahlins's key essays substantivist economic anthropology
opposed formalists substantivists insist economic life produced through cultural rules govern production distribution goods therefore any understanding economic life start cultural principles assumption economy made up independently acting economically rational individuals

contributions historical anthropology after publication culture practical reason 1976 focus shifted relation history anthropology way different cultures understand make history
central concern work problem historical transformation structuralist approaches adequately account
