first went khwaja muhammad usman damani ba'yah too old take new followers
took oath allegiance sayyad laal shah hamdani khalifa khwaja usman
after death shaikh then second oath allegiance son successor khwaja usman khwaja sirajuddin naqshbandi received ijazah khilafat
tabligh preaching established first spiritual center dargah/khanqah named faqirpur shareef 1892 ah district muzaffargarh punjab
due hard-to-reach location faqirpur established another spiritual center named miskeenpur shareef same district near shahar sultan
lived there rest life buried there
biographers written number days spent traveling preaching greater days spent home
traveled many places sindh punjab also traveled current day india multiple times
followed hanafi school law avoided local schools thought india namely deobandi barelvi rather followed naqshbandi school matters
deobandi school shrine pir fazal ali qureshi miskeenpur there conflicting accounts shaikh's biography following deobandi branch hanafi school thought
many followers follow school claim shaikh himself followed
there others claim shaikh never followed deobandi school rather merely visited deoband islamic school preaching islam naqshbandi tariqah
difference opinion even evident immediate family pir qureshi grandsons follow deobandi school while others follow shaykh himself affiliate deoband
pir qureshi scholars deoband mawlana abdul malik writes tajalliyat once shaykh madrasah deoband time zuhr prayer qari muhammad tayyab came lead congregation
covered head cap
after prayer shaykh lack following great sunnah even center learning? pointing lack following sunnah amama turban during prayer
qari sahib asked someone bring amama put near place imam whoever lead congregation take place head
same book mawlana siddiqi narrates mentioned scholar qari muhammad tayyab indeed too happy see shaykh invited home food
pir qureshi accepted visited
shaykh leaving home qari tayyab out pleasure deep respect helped shaykh put shoes
sign deep esteem respect sufism shows esteem scholars deoband gave shaykh
another famous deobandi scholar syed ata ullah shah bukhari also devoted shaykh
once traveling passed near village shaykh visited
pir qureshi ploughing farm time
syed bukhari met requested praying shaykh taught zikr-e-qalbi remembrance heart first lesson naqshbandi sufi order
syed ata'ullah narrates heart immediately started doing zikr
time syed bukhari deeply devoted shaykh reported met multiple times
beliefs many followers maintain pir qureshi believed plain sunni beliefs follow any offshoots sunni islam india
following points malfuzat pir mitha chief khulafa assert idea
shaykh fazal ali himself built covered room meant final burial place pir mitha mawlana abdul sattar brothers khulafa pir qureshi asked them bury there
time death mawlana abdul sattar there people shaykh's will buried there
contradiction deobandi rulings grave must covered
pir fazal ali attended urs sufi saints india gatherings mawlid
also contradiction deobandi doctrine practice urs bid‘ah
most famous attending urs khwaja moinuddin chishti ajmer india shaykh attended urs also listened qawwali sung music prohibited deobandi doctrine
though shaykh himself never listened music neither allowed followers listened qawwali due love khwaja moinuddin chishti ajmeri
also openly proclaimed call upon holy prophet saying ya-rasulullah also evident biography naat written shaykh qureshi also believed making tombs shrines sufi saints righteous practice also believed covering graves saints embroidered clothes practice common most sufi shrines
deobandi scholars strictly prohibit these practices
