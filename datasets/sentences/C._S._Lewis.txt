trilemma main article lewis's trilemma much-cited passage mere christianity lewis challenged view jesus great moral teacher god
argued jesus made several implicit claims divinity logically exclude claim
am trying here prevent anyone saying really foolish thing people often say 'i'm ready accept jesus great moral teacher don't accept claim god
thing must say
man merely man sort things jesus great moral teacher
either lunatic level man says poached egg else devil hell
you must make your choice
either man son god else madman something worse
you shut up fool you spit kill demon you fall feet call lord god let us come any patronising nonsense being great human teacher
left open us
lewis invent argument developed popularized although sometimes referred lewis's trilemma
used christian apologist josh mc dowell book carpenter mc dowell 2001
widely repeated christian apologetic literature largely ignored professional theologians biblical scholars
lewis's christian apologetics argument particular criticised
philosopher john beversluis described lewis's arguments textually careless theologically unreliable particular argument logically unsound example false dilemma
theologian john hick argues new testament scholars now support view jesus claimed god
new testament scholar n
wright criticises lewis failing recognise significance jesus' jewish identity setting oversight best drastically short-circuits argument lays lewis open criticism argument doesn't work history backfires dangerously historical critics question reading gospels although believes doesn't undermine eventual claim
lewis used similar argument lion witch wardrobe digory kirke advises young heroes their sister's claims magical world must logically taken either lies madness truth
universal morality main theses lewis's apologia there common morality known throughout humanity
first five chapters mere christianity lewis discusses idea people standard behaviour expect people adhere
standard called universal morality natural law
lewis claims people over earth know law break
goes claim there must someone something behind such universal set principles
these then two points wanted make
first human beings over earth curious idea ought behave certain way cannot really get rid
secondly fact behave way
know law nature break
these two facts foundation clear thinking ourselves universe live
lewis also portrays universal morality works fiction
chronicles narnia describes universal morality deep magic everyone knew
second chapter mere christianity lewis recognises many people find difficult understand law human nature
responds first idea moral law simply our herd instinct second idea moral law simply social convention
responding second idea lewis notes people often complain set moral ideas better another actually argues there existing real morality comparing other moralities
finally notes sometimes differences moral codes exaggerated people confuse differences beliefs morality differences beliefs facts met people exaggerate differences because distinguished differences morality differences belief facts
example man me three hundred years ago people england putting witches death
you call rule human nature right conduct? surely reason execute witches believe there such things
really thought there people going sold themselves devil received supernatural powers return using these powers kill their neighbours drive them mad bring bad weather surely agree anyone deserved death penalty then these filthy quislings
there no difference moral principle here difference simply matter fact
may great advance knowledge believe witches there no moral advance executing them you think there
you call man humane ceasing set mousetraps because believed there no mice house
lewis also fairly progressive views topic animal morality particular suffering animals evidenced several essays most notably vivisection pains animals
