direct reference ruth barcan marcus proposed view philosophy language according proper names marcus termed mere tags
modalities intensional languages synthese 1961 elsewhere
these tags used refer object bearer name
meaning name regarded exhausted referential function
view contrasts example late bertrand russell's description theory proper names well john searle's cluster description theory names prevailed time
view proper names presented 1962 quine commentator identified quentin smith theory reference given saul kripke's naming necessity
however recent laudatio ruth barcan marcus professor timothy williamson says ideas them resonates most current philosophy language proper names mere tags without descriptive content
kripke's idea names rigid designators designating same object respect relevant worlds ‘rigidified’ definite descriptions rigid designators still descriptive content
rather idea later developed david kaplan others proper names directly referential sense contribute their bearer propositions expressed sentences occur
philosopher language stephen neale also argued against professor smith's claim times literary supplement
necessity identity marcus formally proved necessity identity 1946 informally argued 1961 thereafter thus rejecting possibility contingent identity
see journal symbolic logic 1947 12 pp 12–15 semantics qml marcus prefers interpretation domain interpretation comprises individual entities actual world
she also suggests uses alternative substitutional semantics warranted see below
she provides arguments against possibilia
see dispensing possibilia proceedings american philosophical association 1975–76 possibilia possible worlds grazer philosophische studien 1985–86
t moral conflict marcus defines consistent set moral principles there possible world obeyable
may conflict actual world mark inconsistency
case necessity identity there resistance interpretation moral conflict
her argument counts against widely received view systems moral rules inevitably inconsistent
belief proposed believing relationship agent possible state affairs under specified internal external circumstances
assenting quoted sentence disquotation account belief behavioral marker believing
betting behavior another
wholly language centered account belief e
davidson rejected
agent traditionally described believing impossibility until impossibility disclosed marcus proposes under those circumstances agent should say she claimed believe impossibility
much same way mathematician discovers conjectures false since mathematically false impossible say claimed conjecture true
odd proposal analogous widely accepted principle knowing claim know p p turns out false say used know say mistaken claiming
essentialism aristotelian essentialism concerned properties marcus defines context modal framework
proposal property essential something everything something then necessarily wholly individuating e
natural kind property
otherwise claimed quine others modal logic semantics committed essentialist truths
marcus argues informally there interpretations modal systems essentialist claims false
terence parsons later formally proved result
substitutional quantification alternative tarskian model theoretic semantics proposed uses truth conditions quantified formuli given purely terms truth no appeal domains interpretation
later called others truth value semantics
she shows claim such semantics leads contradictions false
such semantics may interest mathematics e
hartry field fictional discourse
objectual quantification required interpretation identity other metaphysical categories
