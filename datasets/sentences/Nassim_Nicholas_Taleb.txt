writing career taleb's four volume philosophical essay uncertainty titled incerto covers following books fooled randomness 2001 black swan 2007–2010 bed procrustes 2010 antifragile
first non-technical book fooled randomness underestimation role randomness life published year september attacks selected fortune smartest 75 books known
second non-technical book black swan unpredictable events published 2007 selling close 3 million copies february 2011
spent 36 weeks new york times bestseller list 17 hardcover 19 weeks paperback translated 31 languages
book credited predicting banking economic crisis 2008
book aphorisms bed procrustes philosophical practical aphorisms released december 2010
final book incerto series—antifragile things gain disorder—was published november
introduction book taleb describes follows things benefit shocks thrive grow exposed volatility randomness disorder stressors love adventure risk uncertainty
yet spite ubiquity phenomenon there no word exact opposite fragile
let us call antifragile
antifragility beyond resilience robustness
resilient resists shocks stays same antifragile gets better
3 mathematical parallel version incerto quadrilogy available taleb's website
taleb's non-technical writing style described mixing narrative often semi-autobiographical style short philosophical tales historical scientific commentary
sales taleb's first two books garnered advance $4 million follow-up book anti-fragility
ideas theories taleb's book bed procrustes summarizes central problem humans facing limits knowledge things observe unseen unknown resolve tension squeezing life world crisp commoditized ideas
taleb disagrees platonic
theoretical approaches reality extent lead people wrong map reality rather no map
opposes most economic grand social science theorizing view suffer acutely problem overuse plato's theory forms
based these other constructions advocates calls black swan robust society meaning society withstand difficult-to-predict events
also proposed biological economic other systems exhibit ability benefit grow volatility—including particular types random errors events—a characteristic these systems terms antifragility
relatedly also believes universities better public relations claiming credit generating knowledge
argues knowledge technology usually generated calls stochastic tinkering rather top-down directed research182 proposed option-like experimentation way outperform directed research method scientific discovery approach terms convex tinkering
181 ff 213 ff 236 ff taleb called cancellation nobel memorial prize economics saying damage economic theories devastating
opposes top-down knowledge academic illusion believes price formation obeys organic process
together espen gaarder haug taleb asserts option pricing determined heuristic way operators model models lecturing birds how fly
pablo triana explored topic reference haug taleb says perhaps taleb correct urge banks treated utilities forbidden take potentially lethal risks while hedge funds other unregulated entities should able want
taleb's writings discuss error comparing real-world randomness structured randomness quantum physics probabilities remarkably computable games chance like casinos probabilities artificially built
taleb calls ludic fallacy
argument centers idea predictive models based plato's theory forms gravitating towards mathematical purity failing take key ideas account such impossibility possessing relevant information small unknown variations data huge impact flawed theories/models based empirical data fail consider events taken place taken place
discussing ludic fallacy black swan writes dark side moon harder see beaming light costs energy
same way beaming light unseen costly both computational mental effort
second edition black swan posited foundations quantitative economics faulty highly self-referential
states statistics fundamentally incomplete field cannot predict risk rare events problem acute proportion rarity these events
mathematician raphael douady called problem statistical undecidability douady taleb 2010
taleb sees main challenge mapping ideas robustification anti-fragility how live act world understand build robustness black swan events
taleb introduced idea fourth quadrant exposure domain
applications definition most effective least fragile risk management approach calls 'barbell' strategy based avoiding middle favor linear combination extremes across domains politics economics one's personal life
these deemed taleb robust estimation errors
instance suggests investing money 'medium risk' investments pointless because risk difficult impossible compute
preferred strategy both hyper-conservative hyper-aggressive same time
example investor might put 80 90% their money extremely safe instruments such treasury bills remainder going highly risky diversified speculative bets
alternative suggestion engage highly speculative bets limited downside
taleb asserts adopting these strategies portfolio robust gain positive exposure black swan events while limiting losses suffered such random events
together donald geman hélyette geman modeled maximum entropy barbell consists constrain constrained robust manner maximize entropy elsewhere based insight e
jaynes economic life increases entropy under regulatory other constraints
taleb also applies similar barbell-style approach health exercise
instead doing steady moderate exercise daily suggests better low-effort exercise such walking slowly most time while occasionally expending extreme effort
avers human body evolved live random environment various unexpected intense efforts much rest
[citation needed] praise criticism 2008 article times journalist bryan appleyard described taleb now hottest thinker world
nobel laureate daniel kahneman proposed inclusion taleb's name among world's top intellectuals saying taleb changed way many people think uncertainty particularly financial markets
book black swan original audacious analysis ways humans try make sense unexpected events
taleb treated rock star world economic forum annual meeting davos 2009 event harsh words bankers
[clarification needed] taleb contends statisticians pseudoscientists comes risks rare events risks blowups mask their incompetence complicated equations
stance attracted criticism american statistical association devoted august 2007 issue american statistician black swan
magazine offered mixture praise criticism taleb's main points focus taleb's writing style representation statistical literature
robert lund mathematics professor clemson university writes black swan taleb reckless times subject grandiose overstatements professional statistician will find book ubiquitously naive
aaron brown author quant finance professor yeshiva fordham universities book reads taleb never heard nonparametric methods data analysis visualization tools robust estimation
nonetheless calls book essential reading urges statisticians overlook insults get important philosophic mathematical truths
taleb replied second edition black swan most common useless comments hear solutions come 'robust statistics
wonder how using these techniques create information there none
while praising book westfall hilbe 2007 complained taleb's criticism often unfounded sometimes outrageous
taleb writes john kay describes writers professionals knaves fools mostly fools
writing full irrelevances asides colloquialisms reading like conversation raconteur rather tightly argued thesis
hugely enjoyable compelling easy dip
yet beneath rage mockery serious issues
risk management models use today exclude very events against claim protect businesses employ them
these models import veneer technical sophistication
quantitative analysts lulled corporate executives regulators illusory sense security
taleb felt academics showed bad faith criticizing literary book claimed literary book ignoring empirical evidence provided appendix technical works
[citation needed] however berkeley statistician david freedman efforts statisticians refute taleb's stance unconvincing
taleb nobel laureate myron scholes traded personal attacks particularly after taleb's paper espen haug why nobody used black–scholes–merton formula
taleb scholes responsible financial crises 2008 suggested guy should retirement home doing sudoku
funds blown up twice
shouldn't allowed washington lecture anyone risk
scholes retorted taleb simply popularises ideas making money selling books
scholes claimed taleb does cite previous literature reason taleb taken seriously academia
haug taleb 2011 listed hundreds research documents showing black–scholes formula scholes' argued economics establishment ignored literature practitioners mathematicians such ed thorp developed sophisticated version formula
[citation needed] citing academic works same topics covered black swan taleb academics should comment data there make technical comments literary book
[citation needed] no direct published criticism directed ideas rather person style
you never win argument until attack your person
[citation needed] interview charlie rose taleb pleased none criticism received black swan any substance either unintelligent ad hominem style over substance convinced go jugular huge financial bet breakdown statistical methods finance
[full citation needed] taleb's aggressive clearly directed commentary against parts finance industry—e
stating davos 2009 happy lehman brothers collapsed—has led reports personal attacks possible threats
