debate classicism romanticism january 1816 first issue biblioteca italiana giordani published own translation article madame de stael title manner utility translations de stael invited italians abandon isolationism provincialism their native literary traditions abandon their continued reference worn anachronistic mythology order move closer modern foreign literature
felt powerful provocative accusation backwardness literate italians portrayed bunch erudites words de stael went around continually rummaging ancient ashes order find perhaps grain gold
italian responds de stael title article giordani april edition magazine formulated strong rejection de stael's invitation
possible help bunch foreign authors offer resolution most urgent task any literary italian course return linguistic purity? asked giordani
de stael's article offered opportunity state fundamental principle classicism existence form perfection art once attained either lost decadence reattained going back perfect works already realized discovering them makes them most outstanding creations expressions human imagination creative skill
italian writers already imitating classical poets centuries imitation modern foreign writers resulted obfuscation italianity italian literary expression
sciences capable infinite progress able find new truths every day previously unknown giordani
progress arts finished found beautiful learned how express
perfection giordani reached greek latin writers later italians
admitted there many tastes believed these tastes conformable different characters various populations cultures world
precisely reason italian taste offspring greco-roman taste completely extraneous e
english germans
dispute endlessly whether people admire english german poetry truly beautiful much rather false exaggerated therefore ugly
let's suppose beautiful does follow will beautiful us italians mix other things our own
necessary either cease being italians forget our own language our history transform our climate our imagination maintaining these things unchanged accept our poetry our literature must maintained italian cannot remain italian mixed those northern ideas nothing common incompatible ours
am saying italian cannot reasonably desire learn poetry literature northerners easily personally visiting those countries deny those literatures beautiful laudable those belong those countries enrich embellish ours because essentially incompatible
thing go japan out curiosity order see almost different world ours
another thing come back there desire live like japanese among italians
italians should study their own classics latin greek writers
these ideas later exercise profound influence over leopardi notwithstanding romanticism style tone heart deeply committed classicist holding stating many parts zilbaldone elsewhere arts indeed humanity itself systematically degenerated high-point greco-roman past point modern scientific world true beauty no longer attainable because death primitive illusions associated natural non-scientific non-technological world
year later however giordani read first time tragedies shakespeare end up powerfully impressed
am reading works shakespeare appears me new world drama like any new world am finding sorts things enormous beauty substantial misery
must confessed delightful creations great new
contradiction many previous affermations writings added think these works enormous profit italian poets
!! conclusions writings pietro giordani demonstrated strict adherence linguistic classicism eloquence balanced controlled form
rhetoric rarely hollow empty there rigor participation cultural educational problems there strong argument against prejudice obscurantism there aggressive thoughtless banal anti-clericalism there invitation participate comprehend one's own times through study history economics
reason idea literature giordani spite common classicist roots very different monti literary enterprise must consist affermation virtue search truth civil education
poetry must otiose pastime science must studied before latin teaching must integrate both manual intellectual work study contemporary history must come before antiquity
faith happiness humanity once liberated prejudices oppression alternates desolate vision inevitable human unhappiness without conceding anything transcendental illusions
vision solicited leopardi toward necessity dedicating himself practical theoretical overcoming pessimism letting himself dominated philosophy inhibits will
there giordani contradiction rhetorical education urgence renewal there conviction way achieve cultural progress italian society through finding stimulus lessons ancients
contradiction italian history itself expressed finding any elements progress within economically backward social stagnant society alluded himself indisputable value italian literary tradition itself progressive factor
explains perhaps certain restrictedness horizons provincialism never overcome
himself seems conscious certain insuffiency work respect capabilities intellect wish put stone over these poor bones recommend write pietro giordani never known
