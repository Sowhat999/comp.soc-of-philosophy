most years kaplan teaches upper division course philosophy language focusing work either gottlob frege bertrand russell p
also teaches related course kripke's naming necessity
lively[opinion] lectures often focus selected paragraphs russell's denoting well frege's sense reference
work kaplan's work primarily focused issues philosophy language logic
these ventures however sometimes take related issues other fields such philosophy mind
semantics indexicals demonstratives kaplan's most influential contribution philosophy language semantic analysis indexicals demonstratives outlined progressively greater detail series articles dthat logic demonstratives demonstratives afterthoughts
kaplan's insights center two key distinctions may seen responses inability frege's semantics deal context-sensitivity language
first place frege's categories sinn bedeutung typically translated sense reference kaplan introduces notions character content
former linguistic meaning expression latter proposition propositional component expressed expression context
second kaplan makes explicit distinction context utterance circumstances evaluation proposition expressed utterance
context formalized set composed speaker place time possible world depending analysis demonstratives perhaps set either demonstrations directing intentions
circumstances evaluation play role very similar possible worlds modal semantics
these rough distinctions kaplan then defines character content precisely
character defines function associated convention expression takes contextual elements arguments yields content values
content other hand defines function taking arguments those elements circumstances evaluation relevant determining extension yielding extension referent truth-value value
two important notions thus defined
say expression context-sensitive character defines non-constant function
yields different content-values given different context-element-arguments
expression context-insensitive character defines constant function
also distinction character content breaks down case context-insensitive expressions convention associates each such expression directly content
other hand expression directly referential content defines constant function circumstances evaluation extension
kaplan also characterizes directly referential expressions those refer without mediation fregean sinn those whose contribution content their referents
thus case directly referential expressions say distinction content referent breaks down
any singular term directly referential according kaplan
following intuitive picture emerges meaning indexical rule taking us part context expression meaning expression bit propositional content determines extension each possible world
kaplan goes use semantic scheme explain phenomena concerning relationship necessary priori truth
utterance necessarily true content expresses true every possible circumstance while utterance true priori expresses each context content true circumstances context part
am here now true priori because each indexical expressions used 'i' 'here' 'now' directly refer speaker location time utterance
utterance necessarily true because any given speaker might different place time given different circumstances evaluation
other hand am david kaplan spoken david kaplan necessarily true since david kaplan both directly referential expressions refer same object every circumstance evaluation
same statement true priori however because spoken different context e
speaker other kaplan might false
another result kaplan's theory solves frege's puzzle indexicals
roughly puzzle here arises indexicals thought directly referential
refer means fregean sinn
however frege explains cognitive value terms sinn
thus following problem emerges sentences am david kaplan spoken david kaplan david kaplan spoken someone pointing david kaplan david kaplan david kaplan spoken anyone express same content refer same individuals
yet each three different cognitive value possible rationally believe while denying another
kaplan explains associating cognitive value character rather content thus remedying problem
there problems approach kaplan explores afterthoughts
kaplan's semantic theory faces problem however proper names seem both directly referential context-insensitive
kaplan's account means constant functions defined both proper name's character content imply proper names no meaning other their reference
while approach proper names novel john stuart mill being early advocate frege's puzzle thought cast doubt any such account
many philosophers attempted deal issue notably joseph almog david braun michael devitt john perry nathan salmon scott soames howard wettstein no solution widely accepted
quantifying article quantifying 1968 kaplan discusses issues intensional indirect ungerade oblique discourse such substitution failure existential generalization failure distinction de re / de dicto propositional attitude attributions
such issues made salient primarily w
quine quantifiers propositional attitudes 1956
phrase quantifying comes quine's discussion calls relational constructions existential statement
such cases variable bound anterior variable-binding operator occurs within non-extensional context such created 'that' clause alternatively propositional attitude modal operators
quantifying idiom captures notion variable-binding operator example existential quantifier 'something' reaches speak non-extensional context bind variable occurring within scope
example using propositional attitude clause quantifies statement ralph believes ortcutt spy result partly formalized «ùx ralph believes x spy [there someone ralph believes spy] short kaplan attempts among other things provide apparatus fregean vein allows quantify such intensional contexts even exhibit kind substitution failure quine discusses
successful shows quine wrong thinking substitution failure implies existential generalization failure inability quantify clauses exhibit such substitution failure
logic pedagogy & logic 2000 program recent years kaplan devoted much effort teaching introductory logic
main contribution work create computer program logic 2000 students their assignments
logic 2000 currently available use free charge
program many parts including derivations module symbolizations module models module much
program initially developed complement logic text donald kalish richard montague derivations module therefore uses their distinctive natural deduction system
perhaps most significant features program feedback error-checking capacities
program provide student immediate extensive error messages detailing any errors student may made problem she currently working
