thought see also being nothingness sartre's primary idea people humans condemned free
theory relies upon position there no creator illustrated using example paper cutter
sartre says considered paper cutter assume creator plan essence
sartre human beings no essence before their existence because there no creator
thus existence precedes essence
forms basis assertion since cannot explain one's own actions behaviour referencing any specific human nature necessarily fully responsible those actions
left alone without excuse
act without being determined our past separated us
sartre maintained concepts authenticity individuality earned learned
need experience death consciousness wake up ourselves really important authentic our lives life experience knowledge
death draws final point beings cease live ourselves permanently become objects exist outside world
way death emphasizes burden our free individual existence
junior lecturer lycée du havre 1938 sartre novel nausée nausea serves ways manifesto existentialism remains most famous books
taking page german phenomenological movement believed our ideas product experiences real-life situations novels plays well describe such fundamental experiences having equal value discursive essays elaboration philosophical theories such existentialism
such purpose novel concerns dejected researcher roquentin town similar le havre becomes starkly conscious fact inanimate objects situations remain absolutely indifferent existence
such show themselves resistant whatever significance human consciousness might perceive them
also took inspiration phenomenologist epistemology explained franz adler way man chooses makes himself acting
any action implies judgment right under circumstances actor also everybody else similar circumstances
indifference things themselves closely linked later notion being-in-itself being nothingness effect highlighting freedom roquentin perceive act world everywhere looks finds situations imbued meanings bear stamp existence
hence nausea referred title book encounters everyday life suffused pervasive even horrible taste—specifically freedom
book takes term friedrich nietzsche's thus spoke zarathustra used context often nauseating quality existence
no matter how much roquentin longs something else something different cannot get away harrowing evidence engagement world
novel also acts terrifying realization immanuel kant's fundamental ideas freedom sartre uses idea autonomy will morality derived our ability choose reality ability choose being derived human freedom embodied famous saying condemned free way show world's indifference individual
freedom kant exposed here strong burden freedom act towards objects ultimately useless practical application kant's ideas proves bitterly rejected

sartre lifelong companion de beauvoir existed her words world us mere backdrop against our private lives played out
sartre portrayed own pre-war situation character mathieu chief protagonist age reason completed during sartre's first year soldier second world war

mathieu's commitment himself never outside world
mathieu restrained action each time because no reasons acting
sartre then these reasons compelled participate spanish civil war took invasion own country motivate action provide crystallization these ideas
war gave purpose beyond himself atrocities war seen turning point public stance
war opened sartre's eyes political reality yet understood until forced continual engagement world itself destroyed sartre's illusions isolated self-determining individuals made clear own personal stake events time
returning paris 1941 formed socialisme et liberté resistance group
1943 after group disbanded sartre joined writers' resistance group remained active participant until end war
continued write ferociously due crucial experience war captivity sartre began try build up positive moral system express through literature
symbolic initiation new phase sartre’s work packaged introduction new journal les temps modernes october 1945
here aligned journal thus himself left called writers express their political commitment
yet alignment indefinite directed concept left specific party left
sartre's philosophy lent itself being public intellectual
envisaged culture very fluid concept neither pre-determined nor definitely finished instead true existential fashion culture conceived process continual invention re-invention
marks sartre intellectual pragmatist willing move shift stance along events
dogmatically follow cause other belief human freedom preferring retain pacifist's objectivity
overarching theme freedom means work subverts bases distinctions among disciplines
therefore able hold knowledge across vast array subjects international world order political economic organisation contemporary society especially france institutional legal frameworks regulate lives ordinary citizens educational system media networks control disseminate information
sartre systematically refused keep quiet saw inequalities injustices world
sartre sympathized left supported french communist party pcf until 1956 soviet invasion hungary

1956 onwards sartre rejected claims pcf represent french working classes objecting authoritarian tendencies
late 1960 s sartre supported maoists movement rejected authority established communist parties
however despite aligning maoists sartre after may events rereads my books will realize changed profoundly remained anarchist
later explicitly allow himself called anarchist
aftermath war first time properly engaged sartre political matters set forth body work reflected virtually every important theme early thought began explore alternative solutions problems posed there
greatest difficulties public intellectuals time faced increasing technological aspects world outdating printed word form expression
sartre's opinion traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior there recognition new technological 'mass media' forms must embraced sartre's ethical political goals authentic committed intellectual achieved demystification bourgeois political practices raising consciousness both political cultural working class
struggle sartre against monopolising moguls beginning take over media destroy role intellectual
attempts reach public mediated these powers often these powers campaign against
skilled enough however circumvent these issues interactive approach various forms media advertising radio interviews newspaper column example vice versa
role public intellectual lead individual placing himself danger engages disputed topics
sartre's case witnessed june 1961 plastic bomb exploded entrance apartment building
public support algerian self-determination time led sartre become target campaign terror mounted colonists' position deteriorated
similar occurrence took place next year begun receive threatening letters oran algeria
literature sartre successfully number literary modes made major contributions literary criticism literary biography
plays richly symbolic serve means conveying philosophy
best-known huis-clos no exit contains famous line l'enfer c'est les autres usually translated hell other people
aside impact nausea sartre's major work fiction roads freedom trilogy charts progression how world war ii affected sartre's ideas
way roads freedom presents less theoretical practical approach existentialism
despite their similarities polemicists novelists adapters playwrights sartre's literary work counterposed often pejoratively camus popular imagination
1948 roman catholic church placed sartre's oeuvre index librorum prohibitorum list prohibited books
criticism philosophers argue sartre's thought contradictory
specifically believe sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite claim philosophical views ignore metaphysics
herbert marcuse criticized being nothingness projecting anxiety meaninglessness onto nature existence itself insofar existentialism philosophical doctrine remains idealistic doctrine hypostatizes specific historical conditions human existence ontological metaphysical characteristics
existentialism thus becomes part very ideology attacks radicalism illusory
letter humanism heidegger criticized sartre's existentialism existentialism says existence precedes essence
statement taking existentia essentia according their metaphysical meaning plato's time essentia precedes existentia
sartre reverses statement
reversal metaphysical statement remains metaphysical statement
stays metaphysics oblivion truth being
