contributions economics although there evidence richard cantillon wide variety manuscripts essai sur nature du commerce en général abbreviated essai survives
written 1730 published french 1755 translated english henry higgs 1932
although there evidence suggests essai tremendous influence early development economic science cantillon's treatise largely neglected during 19 th century
late 19 th century rediscovered william stanley jevons considered cradle political economy
since then cantillon's essai received growing attention
essai considered first complete treatise economic theory cantillon called father enterprise economics
william petty considered richard cantillon's greatest influences
greatest influences cantillon's writing english economist william petty 1662 tract treatise taxes
although petty provided much groundwork cantillon's essai anthony brewer argues petty's influence overstated
apart petty other possible influences cantillon include john locke cicero livy pliny elder pliny younger charles davenant edmond halley isaac newton sébastien le prestre de vauban jean boisard
cantillon's involvement john law's speculative bubble proved invaluable likely heavily influenced insight relationship increases supply money price production
methodology cantillon's essai written using distinctive causal methodology separating cantillon mercantilist predecessors
essai peppered word natural case cantillon's treatise meant imply cause effect relationship economic actions phenomena
economist murray rothbard credits cantillon being first theorists isolate economic phenomena simple models otherwise uncontrollable variables fixed
cantillon made frequent use concept ceteris paribus throughout essai attempt neutralise independent variables
furthermore credited employing methodology similar carl menger's methodological individualism deducing complex phenomena simple observations
cause effect methodology led relatively value-free approach economic science cantillon uninterested merit any particular economic action phenomenon focusing rather explanation relationships
led cantillon separate economic science politics ethics greater degree previous mercantilist writers
led disputes whether cantillon justly considered mercantilist first anti-mercantilists given cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses specie accumulation positive economic stimuli
others argue instances cantillon thought supported certain mercantilist policies actually provided neutral analysis explicitly stating possible limitations mercantilist policies
monetary theory differences prior mercantilists cantillon arise early essai regarding origins wealth price formation market
cantillon distinguishes wealth money considering wealth itself nothing food conveniences pleasures life
while cantillon advocated intrinsic theory value based input land labour cost production considered touched upon subjective theory value
cantillon held market prices immediately decided intrinsic value derived supply demand
considered market prices derived comparing supply quantity particular good particular market demand quantity money brought exchanged
believing market prices tend towards intrinsic value good cantillon may also originated uniformity-of-profit principle—changes market price good may lead changes supply reflecting rise fall profit
rendition cantillon's primitive circular flow model essai cantillon provided advanced version john locke's quantity theory money focusing relative inflation velocity money
cantillon suggested inflation occurs gradually new supply money localised effect inflation effectively originating concept non-neutral money
furthermore posited original recipients new money enjoy higher standards living expense later recipients
concept relative inflation disproportionate rise prices among different goods economy now known cantillon effect
cantillon also considered changes velocity money quantity exchanges made within specific amount time influential prices although same degree changes quantity money
while believed money supply consisted specie conceded increases money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices effectively increasing velocity circulating deposited specie
apart distinguishing money money substitute also distinguished bank notes offered receipts specie deposits bank notes circulating beyond quantity specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting volume fiduciary media strictly limited people's confidence redeemability
considered fiduciary media useful tool abate downward pressure hoarding specie velocity money
addressing mercantilist belief monetary intervention cause perpetually favourable balance trade cantillon developed specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories
suggested countries high quantity money circulation prices will increase therefore become less competitive relation countries there relative scarcity money
thus cantillon also held increases supply money regardless source cause increases price level therefore reduce competitiveness particular nation's industry relation nation lower prices
however cantillon believe international markets tended toward equilibrium instead suggested government hoard specie avoid rising prices falling competitiveness
furthermore suggested favourable balance trade maintained offering better product retaining qualitative competitiveness
cantillon's preference towards favourable balance trade possibly stemmed mercantilist belief exchange being zero-sum game party gains expense another
relatively advanced theory interest also presented
cantillon believed interest originates need borrowers capital fear loss lenders meaning borrowers recompense lenders risk possible insolvency debtor
turn interest paid out earned profits originating return invested capital
while previously believed rate interest varied inversely quantity money cantillon posited rate interest determined supply demand loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed scottish philosopher david hume
such while saved money impacts rate interest new money instead used consumption does cantillon's theory interest therefore similar john maynard keynes's liquidity preference theory
other contributions traditionally jean-baptiste say credited coining word advancing concept entrepreneur fact cantillon first introduced term essai
cantillon divided society two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners non-fixed income earners
entrepreneurs according cantillon non-fixed income earners pay known costs production earn uncertain incomes due speculative nature pandering unknown demand their product
cantillon while providing foundations develop dedicated theory uncertainty—the topic revisited until 20 th century ludwig von mises frank knight john maynard keynes among others
furthermore unlike later theories entrepreneurship saw entrepreneur disruptive force cantillon anticipated belief entrepreneur brought equilibrium market correctly predicting consumer preferences
spatial economics deal distance area how these may affect market through transportation costs geographical limitations
development spatial economics usually ascribed german economist johann heinrich von thünen however cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly century earlier
cantillon integrated advancements spatial economic theory microeconomic analysis market describing how transportation costs influence location factories markets population centres—that individuals strive lower transportation costs
conclusions spatial economics derived three premises cost raw materials equal quality will higher near capital due transportation costs transportation costs vary transportation type example water transportation considered cheaper land-based transportation larger goods difficult transport will cheaper closer their area production
example cantillon believed markets designed decrease costs both merchants villagers terms time transportation
similarly cantillon posited locations cities result large part wealth inhabiting property owners their ability afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended live farther their property because afford transportation costs
essai spatial economic theory used derive why markets occupied geographical area why costs varied across different markets
cover ludwig von mises institute's edition cantillon's essai apart originating theories entrepreneur spatial economics cantillon also provided dedicated theory population growth
unlike william petty believed there existed considerable amount unused land economic opportunity support economic growth cantillon theorised population grows long there economic opportunities present
specifically cantillon cited three determining variables population size natural resources technology culture
therefore populations grow far three aforementioned variables allowed
furthermore cantillon's population theory modern malthus sense cantillon recognised much broader category factors affect population growth including tendency population growth fall zero society becomes industrialised
influence while essai published until 1755 result heavy censorship france widely circulate form unpublished manuscript completion publication
notably influenced many direct forerunners classical school thought including turgot other physiocrats
cantillon major influence physiocrat françois quesnay may learned cantillon's work through marquis mirabeau
while evident essai influenced quesnay degree remains controversial
there evidence quesnay fully understand completely aware cantillon's theories
many quesnay's economic beliefs elucidated previously essai quesnay reject number cantillon's premises including scarcity land cantillon's population theory
also quesnay recognised scarcity capital capital accumulation prerequisite investment
nevertheless cantillon considered father physiocracy henry higgs due influence quesnay
also possible cantillon influenced scottish economist james steuart both directly indirectly
cantillon few economists cited adam smith directly borrows cantillon's sustenance theory wages
large sections smith's economic theory possibly directly influenced cantillon although many respects adam smith advanced well beyond scope cantillon
economic historians stated adam smith provided little value own intellect notably schumpeter rothbard
any case through influence adam smith physiocrats cantillon quite possibly pre-classical economist contributed most ideas classical school
illustrative cantillon's influence say noticeable methodology employed latter's treatise political economy
