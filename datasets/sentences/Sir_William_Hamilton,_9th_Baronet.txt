place thought hamilton's positive contribution progress thought comparatively slight stimulated spirit criticism pupils insisting great importance psychology opposed older metaphysical method recognition importance german philosophy especially immanuel kant
far most important work philosophy unconditioned development principle human finite mind there no knowledge infinite
basis argument thesis think condition
deeply impressed kant's antithesis subject object knowing known hamilton laid down principle every object known virtue relations other objects
follows limitless time space power etc
fact however thought seems demand idea infinite absolute provides sphere faith thus specific faculty theology
weakness characteristic human mind cannot conceive any phenomenon without beginning hence conception causal relation according every phenomenon cause preceding phenomena effect subsequent phenomena
causal concept therefore ordinary necessary forms cognitive consciousness limited seen being confined relative
regards problem nature objectivity hamilton simply accepts evidence consciousness separate existence object root our nature cannot lie
virtue assumption hamilton's philosophy becomes natural realism
fact whole position strange compound kant reid
chief practical corollary denial philosophy method attaining absolute knowledge relegation academic sphere mental training
transition philosophy theology
sphere faith presented hamilton under analogous relation mind body
mind body unconditioned absolute god world conditioned
consciousness itself conditioned phenomenon must derive depend different thing prior behind material phenomena
curiously enough however hamilton does explain how comes god terms analogy bears conditioned mind relation conditioned mind bears objects himself unconditioned
regarded related consciousness insofar therefore absolute unconditioned
thus very principles hamilton's philosophy apparently violated theological argument
hamilton regarded logic purely formal science seemed unscientific mixing together heterogeneous elements treat parts same science formal material conditions knowledge
quite ready allow view logic cannot used means discovering guaranteeing facts even most general expressly asserted objective validity mutual relations judgments
further held induction deduction correlative processes formal logic each resting necessities thought deriving thence several laws
logical laws recognised three axioms identity noncontradiction excluded middle regarded severally phases general condition possibility existence therefore thought
law reason consequent considered different merely expressing metaphysically these express logically
added postulate—which theory importance--that logic allowed state explicitly thought implicitly
logic hamilton known chiefly inventor doctrine quantification predicate
judgment should really mean whereas ordinary universal proposition should stated
