upon landing antwerp 28 march immediately went german consulate turned passport formally renouncing german citizenship
few years later nazis sold boat turned cottage hitler youth camp
refugee status april 1933 einstein discovered new german government passed laws barring jews holding any official positions including teaching universities
historian gerald holton describes how virtually no audible protest being raised their colleagues thousands jewish scientists suddenly forced give up their university positions their names removed rolls institutions employed
month later einstein's works among those targeted nazi book burnings nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming jewish intellectualism dead

einstein asked them help bring jewish scientists out germany
british historian martin gilbert notes churchill responded immediately sent friend physicist frederick lindemann germany seek out jewish scientists place them british universities
churchill later observed result germany having driven jews out lowered their technical standards put allies' technology ahead theirs
einstein later contacted leaders other nations including turkey's prime minister ismet inönü whom september 1933 requesting placement unemployed german-jewish scientists
result einstein's letter jewish invitees turkey eventually totaled over 1000 saved individuals

mother played piano reasonably well wanted her son learn violin instill love music also help assimilate german culture
according conductor leon botstein einstein begun playing 5 although enjoy age
albert einstein playing violin einstein writer musician nobel laureate rabindranath tagore 1930 turned 13 discovered violin sonatas mozart whereupon einstein fell love mozart's music studied music willingly
taught himself play without ever practicing systematically deciding love better teacher sense duty
age 17 heard school examiner aarau played beethoven's violin sonatas examiner stating afterward playing remarkable revealing 'great insight'
struck examiner writes botstein einstein displayed deep love music quality remains short supply
music possessed unusual meaning student
music took pivotal permanent role einstein's life period
although idea becoming professional himself mind any time among those whom einstein played chamber music few professionals performed private audiences friends
chamber music also become regular part social life while living bern zürich berlin played max planck son among others
sometimes erroneously credited editor 1937 edition köchel catalogue mozart's work edition actually prepared alfred einstein[citation needed] may distant relation

scientific career throughout life einstein published hundreds books articles
published 300 scientific papers 150 non-scientific ones
5 december 2014 universities archives announced release einstein's papers comprising 30000 unique documents
einstein's intellectual achievements originality made word einstein synonymous genius
addition work himself also collaborated other scientists additional projects including bose–einstein statistics einstein refrigerator others
1905 annus mirabilis papers main articles annus mirabilis papers photoelectric effect special theory relativity mass–energy equivalence brownian motion annus mirabilis papers four articles pertaining photoelectric effect gave rise quantum theory brownian motion special theory relativity e = mc2 albert einstein published annalen physik scientific journal 1905
these four works contributed substantially foundation modern physics changed views space time matter
four papers title translated area focus received published significance heuristic viewpoint concerning production transformation light photoelectric effect 18 march 9 june resolved unsolved puzzle suggesting energy exchanged discrete amounts quanta
idea pivotal early development quantum theory
motion small particles suspended stationary liquid required molecular kinetic theory heat brownian motion may 18 july explained empirical evidence atomic theory supporting application statistical physics
electrodynamics moving bodies special relativity 30 june september reconciled maxwell's equations electricity magnetism laws mechanics introducing major changes mechanics close speed light resulting analysis based empirical evidence speed light independent motion observer
discredited concept luminiferous ether
does inertia body depend upon energy content? matter–energy equivalence 27 september 21 november equivalence matter energy e = mc2 implication ability gravity bend light existence rest energy basis nuclear energy
thermodynamic fluctuations statistical physics main articles statistical mechanics thermal fluctuations statistical physics albert einstein's first paper submitted 1900 annalen physik capillary attraction
published 1901 title folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen translates conclusions capillarity phenomena
two papers published 1902–1903 thermodynamics attempted interpret atomic phenomena statistical point view
these papers foundation 1905 paper brownian motion showed brownian movement construed firm evidence molecules exist
research 1903 1904 mainly concerned effect finite atomic size diffusion phenomena
general principles articulated principle relativity
understood hermann minkowski generalization rotational invariance space space-time
other principles postulated einstein later vindicated principle equivalence principle adiabatic invariance quantum number
theory relativity e = mc² main article history special relativity einstein's zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper electrodynamics moving bodies received 30 june 1905 published september same year
reconciles maxwell's equations electricity magnetism laws mechanics introducing major changes mechanics close speed light
later became known einstein's special theory relativity
consequences include time-space frame moving body appearing slow down contract direction motion measured frame observer
paper also argued idea luminiferous aether—one leading theoretical entities physics time—was superfluous
paper mass–energy equivalence einstein produced e = mc2 special relativity equations
einstein's 1905 work relativity remained controversial many years accepted leading physicists starting max planck
photons energy quanta photoelectric effect
incoming photons left strike metal plate bottom eject electrons depicted flying off right
main articles photon quantum 1905 paper einstein postulated light itself consists localized particles quanta
einstein's light quanta nearly universally rejected physicists including max planck niels bohr
idea became universally accepted 1919 robert millikan's detailed experiments photoelectric effect measurement compton scattering
einstein concluded each wave frequency f associated collection photons energy hf each h planck's constant
does say much because sure how particles related wave
does suggest idea explain certain experimental results notably photoelectric effect
quantized atomic vibrations main article einstein solid 1907 einstein proposed model matter each atom lattice structure independent harmonic oscillator
einstein model each atom oscillates independently—a series equally spaced quantized states each oscillator
einstein aware getting frequency actual oscillations different nevertheless proposed theory because particularly clear demonstration quantum mechanics solve specific heat problem classical mechanics
peter debye refined model
adiabatic principle action-angle variables main article old quantum theory throughout 1910 s quantum mechanics expanded scope cover many different systems
after ernest rutherford discovered nucleus proposed electrons orbit like planets niels bohr able show same quantum mechanical postulates introduced planck developed einstein explain discrete motion electrons atoms periodic table elements
einstein contributed these developments linking them 1898 arguments wilhelm wien made
wien shown hypothesis adiabatic invariance thermal equilibrium state allows blackbody curves different temperature derived another simple shifting process
einstein noted 1911 same adiabatic principle shows quantity quantized any mechanical motion must adiabatic invariant
arnold sommerfeld identified adiabatic invariant action variable classical mechanics
wave–particle duality einstein during visit united states main article wave–particle duality although patent office promoted einstein technical examiner second class 1906 given up academia
1908 became privatdozent university bern
über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution strahlung development our views composition essence radiation quantization light earlier 1909 paper einstein showed max planck's energy quanta must well-defined momenta act respects independent point-like particles
paper introduced photon concept although name photon introduced later gilbert n
lewis 1926 inspired notion wave–particle duality quantum mechanics
einstein saw wave-particle duality radiation concrete evidence conviction physics needed new unified foundation
theory critical opalescence main article critical opalescence einstein returned problem thermodynamic fluctuations giving treatment density variations fluid critical point
ordinarily density fluctuations controlled second derivative free energy respect density
critical point derivative zero leading large fluctuations
effect density fluctuations light wavelengths scattered making fluid look milky white
einstein relates rayleigh scattering happens fluctuation size much smaller wavelength explains why sky blue
einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence treatment density fluctuations demonstrated how both effect rayleigh scattering originate atomistic constitution matter
zero-point energy main article zero-point energy series works completed 1911 1913 planck reformulated 1900 quantum theory introduced idea zero-point energy second quantum theory
soon idea attracted attention albert einstein assistant otto stern
assuming energy rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy then compared theoretical specific heat hydrogen gas experimental data
numbers matched nicely
however after publishing findings promptly withdrew their support because no longer confidence correctness idea zero-point energy
general relativity equivalence principle main article history general relativity see also principle equivalence theory relativity einstein field equations eddington's photograph solar eclipse general relativity gr theory gravitation developed albert einstein 1907 1915
according general relativity observed gravitational attraction masses results warping space time those masses
general relativity developed essential tool modern astrophysics
provides foundation current understanding black holes regions space gravitational attraction strong even light escape
albert einstein later reason development general relativity preference inertial motions within special relativity unsatisfactory while theory outset prefers no state motion even accelerated ones should appear satisfactory
consequently 1907 published article acceleration under special relativity
article titled relativity principle conclusions drawn argued free fall really inertial motion free-falling observer rules special relativity must apply
argument called equivalence principle
same article einstein also predicted phenomena gravitational time dilation gravitational red shift deflection light
1911 einstein published another article influence gravitation propagation light expanding 1907 article estimated amount deflection light massive bodies
thus theoretical prediction general relativity first time tested experimentally
gravitational waves 1916 einstein predicted gravitational waves ripples curvature spacetime propagate waves traveling outward source transporting energy gravitational radiation
existence gravitational waves possible under general relativity due lorentz invariance brings concept finite speed propagation physical interactions gravity
contrast gravitational waves cannot exist newtonian theory gravitation postulates physical interactions gravity propagate infinite speed
first indirect detection gravitational waves came 1970 s through observation pair closely orbiting neutron stars psr b1913+16
explanation decay their orbital period emitting gravitational waves
einstein's prediction confirmed february 2016 researchers ligo published direct observation earth gravitational waves exactly hundred years after prediction
hole argument entwurf theory main article hole argument while developing general relativity einstein became confused gauge invariance theory
formulated argument led conclude general relativistic field theory impossible
gave up looking fully generally covariant tensor equations searched equations invariant under general linear transformations
june 1913 entwurf draft theory result these investigations

discovered general field equations predicted universe dynamic either contracting expanding
observational evidence dynamic universe known time einstein introduced new term cosmological constant field equations order allow theory predict static universe
modified field equations predicted static universe closed curvature accordance einstein's understanding mach's principle these years
following discovery recession nebulae edwin hubble 1929 einstein abandoned static model universe proposed two dynamic models cosmos friedman-einstein model 1931 einstein-de sitter model 1932
each these models einstein discarded cosmological constant claiming any case theoretically unsatisfactory
many einstein biographies claimed einstein referred cosmological constant later years biggest blunder
astrophysicist mario livio recently cast doubt claim suggesting may exaggerated
late 2013 team led irish physicist cormac o'raifeartaigh discovered evidence shortly after learning hubble's observations recession nebulae einstein considered steady-state model universe
hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written early 1931 einstein explored model expanding universe density matter remains constant due continuous creation matter process associated cosmological constant
stated paper follows like draw attention solution equation account hubbel's [sic] facts density constant over time
considers physically bounded volume particles matter will continually leaving
density remain constant new particles matter must continually formed volume space
thus appears einstein considered steady state model expanding universe many years before hoyle bondi gold
however einstein's steady-state model contained fundamental flaw quickly abandoned idea
modern quantum theory main article schrödinger equation newspaper headline may 4 1935 einstein displeased quantum theory quantum mechanics very theory helped create despite acceptance other physicists stating god playing dice
einstein continued maintain disbelief theory attempted unsuccessfully disprove until died age 76
1917 height work relativity einstein published article physikalische zeitschrift proposed possibility stimulated emission physical process makes possible maser laser
article showed statistics absorption emission light consistent planck's distribution law emission light mode n photons enhanced statistically compared emission light empty mode
paper enormously influential later development quantum mechanics because first paper show statistics atomic transitions simple laws
einstein discovered louis de broglie's work supported ideas received skeptically first
another major paper era einstein gave wave equation de broglie waves einstein suggested hamilton–jacobi equation mechanics
paper inspire schrödinger's work 1926
bose–einstein statistics main article bose–einstein statistics 1924 einstein received description statistical model indian physicist satyendra nath bose based counting method assumed light understood gas indistinguishable particles
einstein noted bose's statistics applied atoms well proposed light particles submitted translation bose's paper zeitschrift für physik
einstein also published own articles describing model implications among them bose–einstein condensate phenomenon particulates should appear very low temperatures
until 1995 first such condensate produced experimentally eric allin cornell carl wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built nist–jila laboratory university colorado boulder
bose–einstein statistics now used describe behaviors any assembly bosons
einstein's sketches project may seen einstein archive library leiden university
energy momentum pseudotensor main article stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor general relativity includes dynamical spacetime difficult see how identify conserved energy momentum
noether's theorem allows these quantities determined lagrangian translation invariance general covariance makes translation invariance something gauge symmetry
energy momentum derived within general relativity noether's presecriptions make real tensor reason
einstein argued true fundamental reasons because gravitational field made vanish choice coordinates
maintained non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor fact best description energy momentum distribution gravitational field
approach echoed lev landau evgeny lifshitz others become standard
use non-covariant objects like pseudotensors heavily criticized 1917 erwin schrödinger others
unified field theory main article classical unified field theories following research general relativity einstein entered series attempts generalize geometric theory gravitation include electromagnetism another aspect single entity
1950 described unified field theory scientific american article entitled generalized theory gravitation
although continued lauded work einstein became increasingly isolated research efforts ultimately unsuccessful
pursuit unification fundamental forces einstein ignored mainstream developments physics most notably strong weak nuclear forces well understood until many years after death
mainstream physics turn largely ignored einstein's approaches unification
einstein's dream unifying other laws physics gravity motivates modern quests theory everything particular string theory geometrical fields emerge unified quantum-mechanical setting
wormholes main article wormhole einstein collaborated others produce model wormhole
motivation model elementary particles charge solution gravitational field equations line program outlined paper gravitational fields play important role constitution elementary particles?
these solutions cut pasted schwarzschild black holes make bridge two patches
end wormhole positively charged other end negatively charged
these properties led einstein believe pairs particles antiparticles described way
einstein–cartan theory main article einstein–cartan theory einstein office university berlin 1920 order incorporate spinning point particles general relativity affine connection needed generalized include antisymmetric part called torsion
modification made einstein cartan 1920 s
equations motion main article einstein–infeld–hoffmann equations theory general relativity fundamental law—the einstein equations describe how space curves geodesic equation describes how particles move may derived einstein equations
since equations general relativity non-linear lump energy made out pure gravitational fields like black hole move trajectory determined einstein equations themselves new law
einstein proposed path singular solution like black hole determined geodesic general relativity itself
established einstein infeld hoffmann pointlike objects without angular momentum roy kerr spinning objects
other investigations main article einstein's unsuccessful investigations einstein conducted other investigations unsuccessful abandoned
these pertain force superconductivity gravitational waves other research
collaboration other scientists 1927 solvay conference brussels gathering world's top physicists
einstein center
addition longtime collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann others einstein also one-shot collaborations various scientists
einstein–de haas experiment main article einstein–de haas effect einstein de haas demonstrated magnetization due motion electrons nowadays known spin
order show reversed magnetization iron bar suspended torsion pendulum
confirmed leads bar rotate because electron's angular momentum changes magnetization changes
experiment needed sensitive because angular momentum associated electrons small definitively established electron motion kind responsible magnetization
schrödinger gas model einstein suggested erwin schrödinger might able reproduce statistics bose–einstein gas considering box
then each possible quantum motion particle box associate independent harmonic oscillator
quantizing these oscillators each level will integer occupation number will number particles
formulation form second quantization predates modern quantum mechanics
erwin schrödinger applied derive thermodynamic properties semiclassical ideal gas
schrödinger urged einstein add name co-author although einstein declined invitation

bohr versus einstein main article bohr–einstein debates einstein niels bohr 1925 bohr–einstein debates series public disputes quantum mechanics albert einstein niels bohr two founders
their debates remembered because their importance philosophy science
their debates influence later interpretations quantum mechanics
einstein–podolsky–rosen paradox main article epr paradox 1935 einstein returned question quantum mechanics
considered how measurement two entangled particles affect other
noted along collaborators performing different measurements distant particle either position momentum different properties entangled partner discovered without disturbing any way
then used hypothesis local realism conclude other particle these properties already determined
principle proposed possible determine answer position momentum measurement without any way disturbing particle then particle actually values position momentum
principle distilled essence einstein's objection quantum mechanics
physical principle shown incorrect aspect experiment 1982 confirmed bell's theorem promulgated 1964
