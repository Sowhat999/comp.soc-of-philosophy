march 2014 1982's disappearance childhood postman argues define childhood modern phenomenon
defines childhood period around age 7 spoken language usually mastered around age 17 written language mastered
coincidentally these ages correspond typical school years
word child originally meant son daughter modern times gain second meaning person birth full growth
prior modern times children considered little adults rather today's conception them unformed adults
medieval times children adults lived same social intellectual world p
children dressed same adults shared same labor pastimes gambling considered normal childhood pursuit literacy confined special classes monks example similar intellectual levels
few children attended school
children shielded harsh realities shameful secrets adult world
adults conceal their sexual drives nor there high level civilized mores defining certain behavior body functions characteristics distasteful
without well-developed idea shame childhood cannot exist 9
postman middle age's absence literacy education shame explains their absence our conception childhood
postman credits invention movable type printing idea childhood
literacy came adult secrets information available adults read
literacy required schools teach people how read
because school designed preparation literate adult young became perceived miniature adults
unformed adults p

evidence disappearance childhood rise crime perpetrated against children increase sexual activity drug/alcohol abuse children children adults sharing musical tastes language literature movies many big budget movies comic books marketed solely children years ago lack differentiated clothing styles little girls high heels grown men sneakers
even childhood games replaced organized sports little league pee wee etc
like adult sports
adulthood lost much authority aura idea deference older become ridiculous p
makes point civilized behavior acknowledges our animal urges sex violence etc
makes them secrets kept hidden children
since no longer secrets our society may become barbarian
case point foul language no longer kept hidden children become predominant everywhere
while positing theory postman offers no solution society whole
even times before widespread availability internet acknowledged there probably no turning back our visual electronic age
thus writes resistance entails conceiving parenting act rebellion against american culture p
