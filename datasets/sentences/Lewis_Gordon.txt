philosophy work theory black existentialism gordon considered[by whom?] leading scholar several areas thought
first came prominence area black existentialism because first book bad faith antiblack racism 1995 existential phenomenological study antiblack racism anthology existence black anthology black existential philosophy 1997
book written four parts series short chapters times take form phenomenological vignettes
bad faith gordon reads coextensive phenomenon reflective metastability human condition
denial human reality effort evade freedom flight responsibility choice against choice assertion being point view world assertion being world effort deny having point view flight displeasing truths pleasing falsehoods form misanthropy act believing does believe form spirit seriousness sincerity effort disarm evidence gordon innovation form sedimented institutional version these another gordon innovation flight war against social reality
gordon rejects notions disembodied consciousness argues forms bad faith articulates theory body-in-bad-faith
gordon also rejects authenticity discourses
sees them trapped expectations sincerity also form bad faith
proposes instead critical good faith argues requires respect evidence accountability social world world intersubjective relations
question racism racism gordon argues[citation needed] requires rejection another human being’s humanity
since other human being human being such rejection contradiction reality
racist must then deny reality since communication possible racist people object racial hatred then social reality also denied racist assertions
racist then attempts avoid social reality
gordon argues since people “appear” embodied then racism attack embodied realities
effort make embodied realities bodies without points view make points views without bodies
racism also form spirit seriousness gordon means treatment values material features world instead expressions human freedom responsibility
racism ascribes so-called racially inferior people intrinsic values emanate their flesh
result spirit seriousness racist rationality
here gordon agreement frantz fanon argues racists irrational people instead hyper-rational expressions racist rationality
rejects other words theories regard racism function bad emotions passions
such phenomena suggests emerge consequence racist thinking cause
affect emerges other words affect how negotiates reality
willing deal time highly emotional response squeezes time single moment leads overflow prefers believe over afraid facing
gordon analyzes variety issues study antiblack racism such black antiblack racists exoticism racial “qualities” theological-ethical dimensions racism
prefers focus antiblack racism instead “white supremacy” because points out antiblack racism exist without white supremacy
there many people reject white supremacy affirm notions black inferiority
prime example there black antiblack racists
gordon analyzes phenomenon through discussion black use word “nigger” argues bad faith effort black self-exceptionalism—of case user term being object
exoticism other extreme
rejection humanity black people under pretense loving black people
exoticist valorizes black people because she regards black people like animals incapable valid judgment
theology historio-ethics gordon argues[citation needed] theological form studies antiblack racism reveal particular assumption western ethical thought must rejected notion similarity condition ethical obligation
black women worship god whom neither similar nor ever identical demonstrates love does require similarity
gordon argues ethical issue against antiblack racism seeing similarity blacks whites being able simply respect see ethical importance blacks blacks
fight against racism other words does require elimination race noticing racial difference instead demands respecting humanity people exemplify racial difference
existence black gordon outlines themes black existentialism text’s introduction
argues black existentialism addresses many same themes european existentialism key differences
instance although both sets argue notion human being makes no sense outside human communities individuals make no sense without society societies make no sense without individuals european existentialists defend individuality because normative their societies whereas black existentialists focus community order demonstrate their membership human community
question individuality black existentialists becomes showing black people same
themes anguish dread freedom absurdity death examined well through historical reality antiblack racism colonialism along meaning black suffering legitimacy black existence
logic antiblack racism demands blacks offering justifications their existence posed whites
gordon points[citation needed] these dynamics out through discussions w
du bois’s observation black people often treated problems instead people face problems world frantz fanon’s call black people become actional through transcending dialectics seeking white recognition
gordon also argues black existential philosophy area thought means contributions development come anyone understands problematics
other words does black contribute area thought
existence black reflects point since articles other authors variety racial ethnic backgrounds discussing themes ranging african afro-caribbean existential struggles beliefs predestination black feminist struggles postmodern anti-essentialist thought
gordon’s chapter book focuses problem black invisibility points out paradoxical since function black people being hyper-visible
gordon’s place area thought solidified 2000 publication book existentia africana understanding africana existential thought
book explores themes existence—which points out latin etymology means stand out appear—over course examining set new philosophical themes emerge their convergence realities faced african diasporic peoples
gordon argues traditional philosophical questions ones philosophers should look
gordon examines matter philosophical interest topics ranging stratification blacks biographical discourses difficulty studying black people human beings
rejects notion existential philosophy incompatible religious thought
support position examines how religion poses unique questions paths taken struggles liberation also conditions make religious practices such worship possible
ends work reflection writing advances own commitment transcendental philosophical approaches those other words explore conditions through certain phenomena able manifest themselves become possible
crucial here gordon does pit existential philosophy against transcendental philosophy instead argues both
phenomenology colonialism gordon also known[by whom?] founder postcolonial phenomenology leading proponent africana phenomenology enabled make mark fanon studies
gordon able develop postcolonial phenomenology sometimes refers africana phenomenology de-colonial phenomenology through making series important innovations husserlian sartrian phenomenologies
first perhaps most important transformation parenthesizing bracketing natural attitude calls “ontological suspension
although husserl called suspension natural attitude goal primarily epistemological
gordon’s interest however primarily concerned errors occur inappropriate ontological assertions
also concerned metaphysics unlike many contemporary thinkers does reject
instead sees continuation aristotelian metaphysics advances notion substance governed essence leads definition form essential being problem
gordon wants talk social world meanings constructed without reducing physicalist ontology
notion ontological suspension claims compatible husserlian phenomenology advances effort
also advances phenomenology form radically self-reflective thought means must question even methodological assumptions
because must resist epistemological colonization sense phenomenology itself postcolonial decolonizing
because gordon refused time career refer work “philosophy” mean colonizing disciplinary set assumptions
preferred call work “radical thought” meant being willing go roots reality critical way
these moves gordon able generate set theoretical concepts become useful those adopted theoretical lexicon unique formulation crisis theory epistemic closure theory disciplinary decadence teleological suspension disciplinarity analysis maturation tragedy
most these ideas first emerged work gave gordon reputation fanon studies—namely fanon crisis european man essay philosophy human sciences 1995
gordon introduced new stage fanon studies announcing interested writing fanon instead working fanon advancement gordon’s own intellectual project
fanon thus occasion point departure main object study
work then statement gordon’s philosophy fanon text major influence
book offers several innovations question colonialism human sciences
first gordon argues crises really human communities refusing make choices necessary transformation realities created human agency
short forms choices against choice choosing choose amounts bad faith
history argued must transcend imposition world history thus become structured crisis move toward existential-historical understanding human communities basis critical good faith
phenomena such racism colonialism because attempt erase humanity colonized object racism place challenges whether possible study human communities without collapsing acts discursive imperial practices
gordon also made important contribution understanding around work steve biko way new introduction biko's classic text write like
essentialism race scholars[who?] essentialism means cannot study race racism colonialism properly because effect lack essences
gordon argues although human beings incomplete without laws nature does follow cannot studied understood reasonable accuracy
drawing upon thought max weber edmund husserl alfred schutz frantz fanon gordon argued task develop accurate portrayals thematize everyday life
argues racism colonialism everyday phenomena such lived “normal” aspects modern life
even under severe conditions human beings find ways live though under ordinary conditions
ordinariness get point distorting reality
case racism group people allowed live ordinary life under ordinary conditions while another group other groups expected under extraordinary conditions
institutional bad faith renders those extraordinary conditions invisible advances norm false notion shared ordinary set conditions
meaning behind colloquial notion “double standards
gordon here also advances theory provides answer social constructivists study race
fail understand gordon agues sociality also constructed makes social constructivism redundant
many social constructivists[who?] also treat identification constructivity conclusion argument instead beginning
gordon identifying something constructed does mean showing phenomenon false fictional
human beings construct many “real” things such language meaning forms life generated such activities concepts
many people able instance act race concepts racist ones fair degree accuracy
means simply know how read social world bodies through world manifested
error many critics make demand false criterion universality infallibility practice racial identification
gordon argues such demand work identification most social phenomena
required universality nor infallibility generality
gordon defends claim through making distinction law principle
law absolute without exceptions categorical
principle general exceptions
things human principles appropriate ascriptions laws
gordon argues these ideas emerged through reading fanon’s notions sociogenesis
other ideas borrows fanon rejection dialectics recognition unique view racism’s impact ethics concept other
like fanon gordon argues seek white recognition leads dependency whites
also means make whites standard value
yet gordon rejects thesis racism self–other dialectic
antiblack racists see blacks other others gordon’s view
such relations exist whites whomever else see human beings genuine others
thus struggle against antiblack racism ironically blacks become others
displacement otherness means fight against racism governed moral laws tragic ones innocence becomes irrelevant
gordon concludes work look how two scholars read fanon’s importance henry louis gates jr
argued fanon’s biography any contemporary interest good literature
cedric robinson argued gates failed see political dimensions fanon’s thought should read marxist-oriented revolutionary
gordon points out both scholars committing acts disciplinary decadence effect condemning other disciplines being theirs
end book concept disciplinary decadence introduced
returned concept most recently book disciplinary decadence 2006
gordon’s reputation fanon studies grew through co-edited anthology fanon critical reader 1996 many articles over past decade various dimensions fanon’s thought
those works introduced calls “five stages fanon’s studies” offers variety unique readings fanon’s work
shown connections du bois fanon double consciousness written how fanon’s critique white normativity leads question whether modern society any notion normal black person fanon argues seeks coherent notion how possible
gordon’s writings continued expansion related philosophical approaches lexicon
book social criticism her majesty’s other children sketches racism neocolonial age 1997 explored problems critical race theory philosophy introduced most famous thought experiments
chapter “sex race matrices desire” gordon purports created racial-gender-sex-sexuality matrix used challenge our assumptions mixture
white woman matrix instance mixed because her whiteness makes her masculine her womanness makes her black
certain relationships transformed same-sex interracial relationships necessarily homosexual lesbian ones
striking book theme critics noticed earlier books role music prose analysis
gordon here builds argument everyday earlier work argue danger most theories social transformation fail take seriously aesthetic dimensions everyday life
moral political thought economy good constructing contexts people sustain biological social life terrible articulating means live livable world
gordon argues genuinely emancipatory society creates spaces ordinary celebration everyday pleasure
recent work gordon arguing geography reason importance contingency social life
however needs noted legitimacy mixture-matrix largely dependent upon controversial applications semiotics race gender
reason rationality problem western thought gordon argues yoked reason instrumental rationality created antiblack notion reason’s geographical landscape
shifting geography reason argues entail war kinds decadence treat any human community incapable manifesting reason
gordon argues reason broader rationality since must used assess rationality
rationality attempt impose consistency reason reason point out maximum consistency although rational may unreasonable
