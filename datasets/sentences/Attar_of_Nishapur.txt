people helped pharmacy used confide their troubles `attar affected deeply
eventually abandoned pharmacy store traveled widely - baghdad basra kufa mecca medina damascus khwarizm turkistan india meeting sufi shaykhs - returned promoting sufi ideas
`attar's initiation sufi practices subject much speculation
famous sufi shaykhs supposed teachers - majd ud-din baghdadi disciple najmuddin kubra- comes within bounds possibility
certainty regard `attar's own statement once met
any case taken granted childhood onward `attar encouraged father interested sufis their sayings way life regarded their saints spiritual guides

thoughts depicted `attar's works reflects whole evolution sufi movement
starting point idea body-bound soul's awaited release return source other world experienced during present life mystic union attainable through inward purification
explaining thoughts 'attar uses material specifically sufi sources also older ascetic legacies
although heroes most part sufis ascetics also introduces stories historical chronicles collections anecdotes types high-esteemed literature
talent perception deeper meanings behind outward appearances enables turn details everyday life illustrations thoughts
idiosyncrasy `attar's presentations invalidates works sources study historical persons whom introduces
sources hagiology phenomenology sufism however works immense value
judging `attar's writings approached available aristotelian heritage skepticism dislike
interestingly seem want reveal secrets nature
particularly remarkable case medicine fell well within scope professional expertise pharmacist
obviously no motive sharing expert knowledge manner customary among court panegyrists whose type poetry despised never practiced
such knowledge brought works contexts theme story touches branch natural sciences

manṭiq-uṭ-ṭayr main article conference birds led hoopoe birds world set forth search their king simurgh
their quest takes them through seven valleys first hundred difficulties assail them
undergo many trials try free themselves precious them change their state
once successful filled longing ask wine dull effects dogma belief unbelief their lives
second valley birds give up reason love thousand hearts sacrifice continue their quest discovering simurgh
third valley confounds birds especially discover their worldly knowledge become completely useless their understanding become ambivalent
there different ways crossing valley birds fly alike
understanding arrived variously—some found mihrab others idol
fourth valley introduced valley detachment
detachment desire possess wish discover
birds begin feel become part universe detached their physical recognizable reality
their new world planets minute sparks dust elephants distinguishable ants
until enter fifth valley realize unity multiplicity same
become entities vacuum no sense eternity
importantly realize god beyond unity multiplicity eternity
stepping sixth valley birds become astonished beauty beloved
experiencing extreme sadness dejection feel know nothing understand nothing
even aware themselves
thirty birds reach abode simurgh
there no simurgh anywhere see
simurgh's chamberlain keeps them waiting simurgh long enough birds figure out themselves si-murgh — si سی thirty + murgh مرغ bird
seventh valley valley deprivation forgetfulness dumbness deafness death
present future lives thirty successful birds become shadows chased celestial sun
themselves lost sea existence simurgh
