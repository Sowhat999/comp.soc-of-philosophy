interest turned general brain theory visual processing
doctoral dissertation submitted 1969 described model function cerebellum based mainly anatomical physiological data garnered book j
subsequently worked massachusetts institute technology took faculty appointment department psychology 1977 subsequently made tenured full professor 1980
marr proposed understanding brain requires understanding problems faces solutions finds
emphasised need avoid general theoretical debates instead focus understanding specific problems

marr prize most prestigious awards computer vision named honour
cognitive science society also awards marr prize best student paper annual conference
work theories cerebellum hippocampus neocortex marr best known work vision before began work topic published three seminal papers proposing computational theories cerebellum 1969 neocortex 1970 hippocampus 1971
each those papers presented important new ideas continue influence modern theoretical thinking
cerebellum theory motivated two unique features cerebellar anatomy cerebellum contains vast numbers tiny granule cells each receiving few inputs mossy fibers 2 purkinje cells cerebellar cortex each receive tens thousands inputs parallel fibers input single climbing fiber however extremely strong
marr proposed granule cells encode combinations mossy fibre inputs climbing fibres carry teaching signal instructs their purkinje cell targets modify strength synaptic connections parallel fibres
neither those ideas universally accepted both form essential elements viable modern theories
theory neocortex primarily motivated discoveries david hubel torsten wiesel found several types feature detectors primary visual area cortex
marr proposed generalising observation cells neocortex flexible categorizers—that learn statistical structure their input patterns become sensitive combinations frequently repeated
theory hippocampus marr called archicortex motivated discovery william scoville brenda milner destruction hippocampus produced amnesia memories new recent events left intact memories events occurred years earlier
marr called theory simple memory basic idea hippocampus rapidly form memory traces simple type strengthening connections neurons
remarkably marr's paper preceded two years paper tim bliss terje lømo provided first clear report long-term potentiation hippocampus type synaptic plasticity very similar marr hypothesized
marr's paper contains footnote mentioning preliminary report discovery
details marr's theory no longer great value because errors understanding hippocampal anatomy basic concept hippocampus temporary memory system remains number modern theories
end paper marr promised follow-up paper relations hippocampus neocortex no such paper ever appeared
levels analysis marr treated vision information processing system
put forth concert tomaso poggio idea must understand information processing systems three distinct complementary levels analysis
idea known cognitive science marr's tri-level hypothesis computational level does system e
problems does solve overcome similarly why does these things algorithmic/representational level how does system does specifically representations does use processes does employ build manipulate representations implementational/physical level how system physically realised case biological vision neural structures neuronal activities implement visual system after thirty years vision 1982 w
freeman company tomaso poggio adds higher level beyond computational level learning
am sure marr agree am tempted add learning very top level understanding above computational level
then may able build intelligent machines learn see—and think—without need programmed

stages vision include primal sketch scene based feature extraction fundamental components scene including edges regions etc
note similarity concept pencil sketch drawn quickly artist impression
5 sketch scene textures acknowledged etc
note similarity concept stage drawing artist highlights shades areas scene provide depth
3 model scene visualised continuous 3-dimensional map
5 sketch related stereopsis optic flow motion parallax
5 sketch represents reality see our surroundings construct viewer-centered three dimensional view our environment
