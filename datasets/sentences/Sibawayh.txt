arabic does need use any verb-form like such situations
other side al-kisa'i argued
fa-'ida huwa 'iyyahaفإذا هو إياها literally
sure-enough her meaning her
[a] sibawayh justified position theoretical grammatical grounds arguing accusative form cannot predicate dismay al-kisa'i ushered four bedouin pretending just happened waiting door al-kisa'i bribed them support answer prior debate
them testified huwa 'iyyaha way therefore sibawayh wrong left court

legacy sibawayh's tomb shiraz
sibawayh non-arab first write arabic grammar passing first explain arabic grammar non-arab perspective
both sibawayh teacher al-farahidi historically earliest most significant figures respect formal recording arabic language
much impetus work came desire non-arab muslims understand qur'an properly thoroughly qur'an composed poetic language even native arabic speakers must study great care order comprehend thoroughly even difficult those like sibawayh grow up speaking arabic
additionally because arabic does necessarily mark pronounced vowel sounds erroneous arab misreading sibawayh obviously should interpreted sibuyeh illustrates possible misread text aloud see short vowels arabic such difficulty particularly troublesome muslims regard qur'an literal word god man such should never mispronounced misread
since sibawayh's death subsequent scholars arabic grammar often compared
niftawayh received name combination nift asphalt due dark complexion wayh because love sibawayh's works
abu turab al-zahiri referred sibawayh modern era due fact although arab descent arabic language mother tongue
al-kitab sibawayh's al-kitab first book arabic grammar ever written
kitab likely first published book arabic form prose rather poetry set standard explaining rather merely describing grammar subsequent grammarians arabic followed
formula begins syntax then finishes morphology phonetics included appendix
each chapter started definitions new concepts introduced
sibawayh defined arabic verbs belonging either three tenses past present future being represented two forms defined past past tense resembling present future tenses
sibawayh most often support claims points verses arabic poetry
while great deal quotes poems pre-islamic arabia bedouins also quote poets up era early umayyad caliphate
while predominantly book grammar sibawayh touch topic arabic phonology prohibiting deviations standard pronunciation arabic alphabet
even disagrees al-farahidi teachers author first arabic dictionary kitab al-'ayn contradicting latter's classification arabic letters groups
also touched topic ethics
sibawayh's view speech like other human behaviors thus governed right wrong correct incorrect grammatical forms described same terms right wrong used morality
kitab held high esteem linguists earliest written source arabic grammar well very long detailed
