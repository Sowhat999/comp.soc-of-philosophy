weierstrass son wilhelm weierstrass government official theodora vonderforst
interest mathematics began while gymnasium student theodorianum paderborn
sent university bonn upon graduation prepare government position
because studies fields law economics finance immediately conflict hopes study mathematics
resolved conflict paying little heed planned course study continued private study mathematics
outcome leave university without degree
after studied mathematics university münster even time very famous mathematics father able obtain place teacher training school münster
later certified teacher city
during period study weierstrass attended lectures christoph gudermann became interested elliptic functions
1843 taught deutsch krone west prussia since 1848 taught lyceum hosianum braunsberg
besides mathematics also taught physics botanics gymnastics
weierstrass may illegitimate child named franz widow friend carl wilhelm borchardt
after 1850 weierstrass suffered long period illness able publish papers brought fame distinction
university königsberg conferred honorary doctor's degree 31 march 1854
1856 took chair gewerbeinstitut later became technical university berlin
1864 became professor friedrich-wilhelms-universität berlin later became humboldt universität zu berlin
immobile last three years life died berlin pneumonia
mathematical contributions soundness calculus weierstrass interested soundness calculus time there somewhat ambiguous definitions regarding foundations calculus hence important theorems proven sufficient rigour
while bolzano developed reasonably rigorous definition limit early 1817 possibly even earlier work remained unknown most mathematical community until years later many mathematicians vague definitions limits continuity functions
delta-epsilon proofs first found works cauchy 1820 s
cauchy clearly distinguish continuity uniform continuity interval
notably 1821 cours d'analyse cauchy argued pointwise limit pointwise continuous functions itself pointwise continuous statement interpreted being incorrect many scholars
correct statement rather uniform limit continuous functions continuous also uniform limit uniformly continuous functions uniformly continuous
required concept uniform convergence first observed weierstrass's advisor christoph gudermann 1838 paper gudermann noted phenomenon define elaborate
weierstrass saw importance concept both formalized applied widely throughout foundations calculus
formal definition continuity function formulated weierstrass follows continuous such every domain simple english continuous point each there exists such function lies
using definition proved intermediate value theorem
also proved bolzano-weierstrass theorem used study properties continuous functions closed bounded intervals
calculus variations weierstrass also made significant advancements field calculus variations
using apparatus analysis helped develop weierstrass able give complete reformulation theory paved way modern study calculus variations
among several significant axioms weierstrass established necessary condition existence strong extrema variational problems
also helped devise weierstrass–erdmann condition gives sufficient conditions extremal corner along given extrema allows find minimizing curve given integral
