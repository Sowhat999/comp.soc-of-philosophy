applicative universal grammar aug core shaumyan's linguistic theory applicative universal grammar aug
theory first introduced book strukturnaja lingvistika structural linguistics published moscow 1965
aug based combinatorial logic grammatical categories built two primitive universal types called term t sentence s exist every language
term represents noun noun phrase example dog dog big dog considered terms
dog runs complete sentence
verb runs operator acts upon operand term dog transforms complete sentence dog runs
shaumyan's operator notation verb runs represented symbolically ots
recently aug used computational linguistics development natural language parsing program using programming language haskell
natural language parsing important applications machine translation sentences language another
paper entitled using types parse natural language proceedings glasgow functional programming workshop ifip springer verlag 1995 mark p
jones paul hudak shaumyan give brief introduction aug understand way aug works useful think words phrases atoms expressions respectively typed language combinators
our simplified version aug there just two primitive types t representing terms example nouns such friend noun phrases such my friend s representing complete sentences such my friend runs
non-primitive type form oxy denoting phrases transform phrases type x modified phrases type most important concept behind aug formalism
example word my treated having type ott since applied term type t obtain modified term also type t every word pre-assigned types way
thus construction noun phrase my friend described inference generally use following rule describe application phrase p type oxy another q type x clearly types form oxy correspond function types written x --> conventional notation while typing rule above standard method typing application function p argument value q
o function types used descriptions aug cited above most part will continue use same notation here avoid any confusion type expressions haskell our program types natural language phrases represented data values haskell types
another advantage prefix o notation avoids need parentheses allows compact notation types
results parsing complete sentence described tree structure labelled types words phrases used construction
following example produced directly program described later input string my friend lives boston
results parsing complete sentence described tree structure labelled types words phrases used construction
following example produced directly program described later input string my friend lives boston
notice maintain original word order allowed both forward backward application functions arguments
first these described rule above while second just example tree above used rule apply phrase boston intransitive verb lives function acts modifier turning action living specific action living boston
sometimes useful rearrange trees produced parsing phrase functions written left arguments applied
reveals applicative structure particular phrase helps us concentrate underlying grammatical structure without being distracted concerns word order -- vary considerably language another
rewriting parse tree above way obtain situations types subphrases required use flattened curried form these trees such boston lives my friend describe result parsing phrase
two different ways arranging parse tree shown here correspond concepts phenotype genotype grammar respectively aug will discussed any further detail here
most important tasks application aug assign suitable types each word given lexicon dictionary
type t obvious choice simple nouns like friend boston example above
possessive pronouns like my treated same way adjectives using type ott
similar way intransitive verbs like lives described type ots transforming subject term type t sentence phrase type s
word type otootsots example above deserves special attention
motivated diagram above think function combines place type t where? action type ots what? subject type t who? obtain sentence phrase type s
