ross's ethical theory w
ross moral realist non-naturalist intuitionist
argued there moral truths
moral order
just much part fundamental nature universe
any possible universe there moral agents spatial numerical structure expressed axioms geometry arithmetic
thus according ross claim something good true thing really good
ross also agreed g
moore's claim any attempt define ethical statements solely terms statements natural world commits naturalistic fallacy
ross rejected moore's consequentialist ethics
according consequentialist theories people ought determined whether their actions will bring most good
contrast ross argues maximising good several prima facie duties prima facie obligations play role determining person ought any given case
ross gives list seven prima facie duties does claim all-inclusive fidelity reparation gratitude non-maleficence justice beneficence self-improvement
any given situation any number these prima facie duties may apply
case ethical dilemmas may even contradict another
someone prima facie duty reparation say duty help people helped you shift house shift house themselves prima facie duty fidelity say taking your children promised trip park these conflict
nonetheless there never true ethical dilemma ross argue because prima facie duties given situation weightiest over-rules others
thus absolute obligation absolute duty action person ought perform
frequently argued however ross should used term pro tanto rather prima facie
shelly kagan example may helpful note explicitly distinguishing pro tanto prima facie reasons depart unfortunate terminology proposed ross invited confusion misunderstanding
take despite misleading label actually pro tanto reasons ross mind discussion calls prima facie duties
explaining difference pro tanto prima facie kagan pro tanto reason genuine weight nonetheless may outweighed other considerations
thus calling reason pro tanto reason distinguished calling prima facie reason take involve epistemological qualification prima facie reason appears reason may actually reason
ironically ross' prima facie duties neither prima facie nor duties
prima facie means something like appears first glance since ross' prima facie duties everywhere pro tanto reasons favour something's being moral reason
duties since duties obligations must performed under any circumstances
duties obligations strictly speaking never outweighed ross' prima facie duties often outweighed other factors
why kagan says ross actually talking pro tanto moral reasons strictly speaking prima facie duties
