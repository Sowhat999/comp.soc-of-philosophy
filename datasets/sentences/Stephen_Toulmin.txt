meta-philosophy objection absolutism relativism throughout many works toulmin pointed out absolutism represented theoretical analytic arguments limited practical value
absolutism derived plato's idealized formal logic advocates universal truth accordingly absolutists believe moral issues resolved adhering standard set moral principles regardless context
contrast toulmin contends many these so-called standard principles irrelevant real situations encountered human beings daily life
develop contention toulmin introduced concept argument fields
uses argument 1958 toulmin claims aspects arguments vary field field hence called field-dependent while other aspects argument same throughout fields hence called field-invariant
flaw absolutism toulmin believes lies unawareness field-dependent aspect argument absolutism assumes aspects argument field invariant
human understanding 1972 toulmin suggests anthropologists tempted side relativists because noticed influence cultural variations rational arguments
other words anthropologist relativist overemphasizes importance field-dependent aspect arguments neglects unaware field-invariant elements
order provide solutions problems absolutism relativism toulmin attempts throughout work develop standards neither absolutist nor relativist assessing worth ideas
cosmopolis 1990 traces philosophers' quest certainty back rené descartes thomas hobbes lauds john dewey wittgenstein martin heidegger richard rorty abandoning tradition
humanizing modernity cosmopolis toulmin seeks origins modern emphasis universality philosophers' quest certainty criticizes both modern science philosophers having ignored practical issues preference abstract theoretical issues
pursuit absolutism theoretical arguments lacking practicality example view main defects modern philosophy
similarly toulmin sensed thinning morality field sciences diverted attention practical issues concerning ecology production atomic bomb
solve problem toulmin advocated return humanism consisting four returns return oral communication discourse plea rejected modern philosophers whose scholarly focus printed page return particular individual cases deal practical moral issues occurring daily life opposed theoretical principles limited practicality return local concrete cultural historical contexts finally return timely timeless problems things whose rational significance depends time lines our solutions
follows up critique return reason 2001 seeks illuminate ills view universalism caused social sphere discussing among other things discrepancy mainstream ethical theory real-life ethical quandaries
argumentation toulmin model argument toulmin's influential uses argument 1958
cover 1999 paperback 15 th reprinting form
book remains print toulmin argumentation diagrammed conclusion established less basis fact supported warrant backing possible rebuttal
arguing absolutism lacks practical value toulmin aimed develop different type argument called practical arguments also known substantial arguments
contrast absolutists' theoretical arguments toulmin's practical argument intended focus justificatory function argumentation opposed inferential function theoretical arguments
whereas theoretical arguments make inferences based set principles arrive claim practical arguments first find claim interest then provide justification
toulmin believed reasoning less activity inference involving discovering new ideas process testing sifting already existing ideas—an act achievable through process justification
toulmin believed good argument succeed needs provide good justification claim
believed will ensure stands up criticism earns favourable verdict
uses argument 1958 toulmin proposed layout containing six interrelated components analyzing arguments claim conclusion conclusion whose merit must established
argumentative essays may called thesis
example person tries convince listener british citizen claim am british citizen
ground fact evidence data fact appeals foundation claim
example person introduced support claim supporting data born bermuda
2 warrant statement authorizing movement ground claim
order move ground established 2 born bermuda claim am british citizen person must supply warrant bridge gap 2 statement man born bermuda will legally british citizen
3 backing credentials designed certify statement expressed warrant backing must introduced warrant itself convincing enough readers listeners
example listener does deem warrant 3 credible speaker will supply legal provisions trained barrister london specialising citizenship know man born bermuda will legally british citizen
rebuttal statements recognizing restrictions may legitimately applied claim
rebuttal exemplified follows man born bermuda will legally british citizen unless betrayed britain become spy another country
qualifier words phrases expressing speaker's degree force certainty concerning claim
such words phrases include probably possible impossible certainly presumably far evidence goes necessarily
claim am definitely british citizen greater degree force claim am british citizen presumably
first three elements claim data warrant considered essential components practical arguments while second triad qualifier backing rebuttal may needed arguments
toulmin first proposed layout argumentation based legal arguments intended used analyze rationality arguments typically found courtroom
toulmin realize layout applicable field rhetoric communication until works introduced rhetoricians wayne brockriede douglas ehninger
after toulmin published introduction reasoning 1979 rhetorical applications layout mentioned works
toulmin's argument model inspired research example goal structuring notation gsn see goal modelling widely used developing safety cases argument maps associated software
ethics good reasons approach reason ethics 1950 doctoral dissertation toulmin sets out good reasons approach ethics criticizes considers subjectivism emotivism philosophers such
ayer because view fail justice ethical reasoning
revival casuistry reviving casuistry also known case ethics toulmin sought find middle ground extremes absolutism relativism
casuistry practiced widely during middle ages renaissance resolve moral issues
although casuistry largely fell silent during modern period abuse casuistry history moral reasoning 1988 toulmin collaborated albert r
jonsen demonstrate effectiveness casuistry practical argumentation during middle ages renaissance effectively reviving permissible method argument
casuistry employs absolutist principles called type cases paradigm cases without resorting absolutism
uses standard principles example sanctity life referential markers moral arguments
individual case then compared contrasted type case
given individual case completely identical type case moral judgments made immediately using standard moral principles advocated type case
individual case differs type case differences will critically assessed order arrive rational claim
through procedure casuistry toulmin jonsen identified three problematic situations moral reasoning first type case fits individual case ambiguously second two type cases apply same individual case conflicting ways third unprecedented individual case occurs cannot compared contrasted any type case
through use casuistry toulmin demonstrated reinforced previous emphasis significance comparison moral arguments significance addressed theories absolutism relativism
philosophy science evolutionary model 1972 toulmin published human understanding asserts conceptual change evolutionary process
book toulmin attacks thomas kuhn's account conceptual change seminal work structure scientific revolutions
kuhn believed conceptual change revolutionary process opposed evolutionary process during mutually exclusive paradigms compete replace another
toulmin criticized relativist elements kuhn's thesis arguing mutually exclusive paradigms provide no ground comparison kuhn' made relativists' error overemphasizing field variant while ignoring field invariant commonality shared argumentation scientific paradigms
contrast kuhn's revolutionary model toulmin proposed evolutionary model conceptual change comparable darwin's model biological evolution
toulmin states conceptual change involves process innovation selection
innovation accounts appearance conceptual variations while selection accounts survival perpetuation soundest conceptions
innovation occurs professionals particular discipline come view things differently their predecessors selection subjects innovative concepts process debate inquiry toulmin considers forum competitions
soundest concepts will survive forum competition replacements revisions traditional conceptions
absolutists' point view concepts either valid invalid regardless contexts
relativists' perspective concept neither better nor worse rival concept different cultural context
toulmin's perspective evaluation depends process comparison determines whether concept will improve explanatory power rival concepts
