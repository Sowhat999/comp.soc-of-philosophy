distribution eigenvalues further information weyl law weyl conjecture 1911 weyl published über die asymptotische verteilung eigenwerte asymptotic distribution eigenvalues proved eigenvalues laplacian compact domain distributed according so-called weyl law
1912 suggested new proof based variational principles
weyl returned topic several times considered elasticity system formulated weyl conjecture
these works started important domain—asymptotic distribution eigenvalues—of modern analysis
geometric foundations manifolds physics further information weyl transformation weyl tensor 1913 weyl published die idee riemannschen fläche concept riemann surface gave unified treatment riemann surfaces
weyl utilized point set topology order make riemann surface theory rigorous model followed later work manifolds

weyl major figure göttingen school fully apprised einstein's work early days
tracked development relativity physics raum zeit materie space time matter 1918 reaching 4 th edition 1922
1918 introduced notion gauge gave first example now known gauge theory
weyl's gauge theory unsuccessful attempt model electromagnetic field gravitational field geometrical properties spacetime
weyl tensor riemannian geometry major importance understanding nature conformal geometry
1929 weyl introduced concept vierbein general relativity
overall approach physics based phenomenological philosophy edmund husserl specifically husserl's 1913 ideen zu einer reinen phänomenologie und phänomenologischen philosophie
erstes buch allgemeine einführung die reine phänomenologie ideas pure phenomenology phenomenological philosophy
first book general introduction
husserl reacted strongly gottlob frege's criticism first work philosophy arithmetic investigating sense mathematical other structures frege distinguished empirical reference
[citation needed] topological groups lie groups representation theory main articles peter–weyl theorem weyl group weyl spinor weyl algebra 1923 1938 weyl developed theory compact groups terms matrix representations
compact lie group case proved fundamental character formula
these results foundational understanding symmetry structure quantum mechanics put group-theoretic basis
included spinors
together mathematical formulation quantum mechanics large measure due john von neumann gave treatment familiar since 1930
non-compact groups their representations particularly heisenberg group also streamlined specific context 1927 weyl quantization best extant bridge classical quantum physics date
time certainly much helped weyl's expositions lie groups lie algebras became mainstream part both pure mathematics theoretical physics
book classical groups seminal difficult text reconsidered invariant theory
covered symmetric groups general linear groups orthogonal groups symplectic groups results their invariants representations
harmonic analysis analytic number theory details topic see weyl's criterion
weyl also showed how use exponential sums diophantine approximation criterion uniform distribution mod fundamental step analytic number theory
work applied riemann zeta function well additive number theory
developed many others
foundations mathematics continuum weyl developed logic predicative analysis using lower levels bertrand russell's ramified theory types
able develop most classical calculus while using neither axiom choice nor proof contradiction avoiding georg cantor's infinite sets
weyl appealed period radical constructivism german romantic subjective idealist fichte
shortly after publishing continuum weyl briefly shifted position wholly intuitionism brouwer
continuum constructible points exist discrete entities
weyl wanted continuum aggregate points
controversial article proclaiming himself l
brouwer revolution
article far influential propagating intuitionistic views original works brouwer himself
george pólya weyl during mathematicians' gathering zürich 9 february 1918 made bet concerning future direction mathematics
weyl predicted subsequent 20 years mathematicians come realize total vagueness notions such real numbers sets countability moreover asking truth falsity least upper bound property real numbers meaningful asking truth basic assertions hegel philosophy nature
any answer such question unverifiable unrelated experience therefore senseless
however within few years weyl decided brouwer's intuitionism put too great restrictions mathematics critics
crisis article disturbed weyl's formalist teacher hilbert later 1920 s weyl partially reconciled position hilbert
after 1928 weyl apparently decided mathematical intuitionism compatible enthusiasm phenomenological philosophy husserl apparently earlier thought
last decades life weyl emphasized mathematics symbolic construction moved position closer hilbert ernst cassirer
weyl however rarely refers cassirer brief articles passages articulating position
1949 weyl thoroughly disillusioned ultimate value intuitionism mathematics brouwer gains highest intuitive clarity
succeeds developing beginnings analysis natural manner time preserving contact intuition much closely done before
cannot denied however advancing higher general theories inapplicability simple laws classical logic eventually results almost unbearable awkwardness
mathematician watches pain greater part towering edifice believed built concrete blocks dissolve mist before eyes
weyl fermions main article weyl fermion 1929 weyl proposed fermion use replacement theory relativity
fermion massless quasiparticle carry electric charge
electron split two weyl fermions formed two weyl fermions
neutrinos once thought weyl fermions now known mass
weyl fermions sought after electronics applications solve problems electrons present
such quasiparticles discovered 2015 form crystals known weyl semimetals type topological material
quotes question ultimate foundations ultimate meaning mathematics remains open know direction will find final solution nor even whether final objective answer expected
mathematizing may well creative activity man like language music primary originality whose historical decisions defy complete objective rationalization

photo erwin annemarie schrödinger's combined gravemarker alpbacher friedhof alpbach cemetery located alpbach kufstein district tirol austria gravemarker gives annemarie's birthdate december 31 1896 — december 3 1896 mistakenly reported numerous internet websites — her deathdate october 3 1965
annemarie's maiden surname bertel
born salzburg austria annemarie daughter eduard bertel 1856 after 1914 prosperous photographer court photographer actor industrialist whose various businesses headquartered salzburg
however reported eduard moved vienna 1909 1910
annemarie's mother believed illegitimate daughter georg junger 1831-1908 famous wealthy salzburg businessman 1858 founded firm wholesale merchants selling fashion accessories located altermarkt section salzburg
annemarie older brother named erich bertel younger sister named irmgard bertel

ruth georgie erica march born may 30 1934 oxford england but—according records presented here—it appears her birth wasn't registered british authorities until 3 rd registration quarter july–august-september quarter year 1934
ruth's actual biological father erwin schrödinger 1887–1961 her mother hildegunde march née holzhammer born 1900 wife austrian physicist arthur march february 23 1891 april 17 1957
hildegunde's friends often called her hilde hilda rather hildegunde
arthur march erwin schrödinger's assistant time ruth's birth
reason ruth's surname march instead schrödinger because arthur agreed named ruth's father her birth certificate even though wasn't her biological father
ruth married engineer arnulf braunizer may 1956 lived alpbach austria many years
ruth very active sole administrator intellectual other property her father erwin's estate she manages alpbach
