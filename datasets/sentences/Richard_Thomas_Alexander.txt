new college 1930-1939 alexander’s experiences thus far convinced new type teachers college necessary address social issues day
originally new college’s progressive foundations philosophical origins influences concept community critical pedagogy german progressive education
after planning new college began united states suffered economic upheaval great depression
resulting influences then included social reconstruction student activism
there planned departure traditional teacher-training institutions placing special emphasis child nature development through experiences designed give student insight problems contemporary social life
alexander sought develop critical consciousness students intellectually based social leadership provide guidance effectually meeting universally persistent problems living essential problems living students reality humans face stages their development individuals members social groups teachers children adults
using innovative ideas such extended foreign study community-based active research authentic assessment portfolio-based undergraduate learning curriculum developed rejected traditional summative grades accumulation credits basis degree completion
