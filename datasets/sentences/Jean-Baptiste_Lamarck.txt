set out develop explanation may 1800 21 st day floreal year viii revolutionary timescale used france time presented lecture muséum national d'histoire naturelle first outlined newly developing ideas evolution
lamarck late life 1801 published système des animaux sans vertebres major work classification invertebrates
work introduced definitions natural groups among invertebrates
categorized echinoderms arachnids crustaceans annelids separated old taxon worms known vermes
lamarck first separate arachnids insects classification moved crustaceans separate class insects
1802 lamarck published hydrogéologie became first use term biology modern sense
hydrogéologie lamarck advocated steady-state geology based strict uniformitarianism
argued global currents tended flow east west continents eroded their eastern borders material carried across deposited western borders
thus earth's continents marched steadily westward around globe
year also published recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants drew out theory evolution
believed life organized vertical chain gradation lowest forms highest forms life thus demonstrating path progressive developments nature
own work lamarck favored then-more traditional theory based classical four elements
during lamarck's lifetime became controversial attacking enlightened chemistry proposed lavoisier
also came conflict widely respected palaeontologist georges cuvier supporter evolution
according peter j
bowler cuvier ridiculed lamarck's theory transformation defended fixity species

— gould 1993 lamarckian evolution main article lamarckism lamarck stressed two main themes biological work
first environment gives rise changes animals
cited examples blindness moles presence teeth mammals absence teeth birds evidence principle
second principle life structured orderly manner many different parts bodies make possible organic movements animals
although first thinker advocate organic evolution first develop truly coherent evolutionary theory
outlined theories regarding evolution first floreal lecture 1800 then three later published works recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants 1802
philosophie zoologique 1809
histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres seven volumes 1815–22
lamarck employed several mechanisms drivers evolution drawn common knowledge day own belief chemistry pre-lavoisier
used these mechanisms explain two forces saw comprising evolution force driving animals simple complex forms force adapting animals their local environments differentiating them each other
believed these forces must explained necessary consequence basic physical principles favoring materialistic attitude toward biology
le pouvoir de vie complexifying force lamarck referred tendency organisms become complex moving up ladder progress
referred phenomenon le pouvoir de vie force qui tend sans cesse à composer l'organisation force perpetually tends make order
lamarck believed ongoing spontaneous generation simple living organisms through action physical matter material life force
lamarck ran against modern chemistry promoted lavoisier whose ideas regarded disdain preferring embrace traditional alchemical view elements influenced primarily earth air fire water
asserted once living organisms form movements fluids living organisms naturally drove them evolve toward ever greater levels complexity rapid motion fluids will etch canals delicate tissues
soon their flow will begin vary leading emergence distinct organs
fluids themselves now elaborate will become complex engendering greater variety secretions substances composing organs
— histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertebres 1815 argued organisms thus moved simple complex steady predictable way based fundamental physical principles alchemy
view simple organisms never disappeared because constantly being created spontaneous generation described steady-state biology
lamarck saw spontaneous generation being ongoing simple organisms thus created being transmuted over time becoming complex
sometimes regarded believing teleological goal-oriented process organisms became perfect evolved though materialist emphasized these forces must originate necessarily underlying physical principles
according paleontologist henry fairfield osborn lamarck denied absolutely existence any 'perfecting tendency' nature regarded evolution final necessary effect surrounding conditions life
charles coulston gillispie historian science written life purely physical phenomenon lamarck
views should confused vitalist school thought
l'influence des circonstances adaptive force second component lamarck's theory evolution adaptation organisms their environment
move organisms upward ladder progress new distinct forms local adaptations
also drive organisms evolutionary blind alleys organism became finely adapted no further change occur
lamarck argued adaptive force powered interaction organisms their environment use disuse certain characteristics
first law every animal passed limit development frequent continuous use any organ gradually strengthens develops enlarges organ gives power proportional length time used while permanent disuse any organ imperceptibly weakens deteriorates progressively diminishes functional capacity until finally disappears
first law says little except exaggerated generalization belief exercise develops organ
second law acquisitions losses wrought nature individuals through influence environment their race long placed hence through influence predominant use permanent disuse any organ these preserved reproduction new individuals arise provided acquired modifications common both sexes least individuals produce young
last clause law introduces now called soft inheritance
second law widely accepted time
[but] decisively rejected modern genetics
however field epigenetics there growing evidence soft inheritance plays part changing organisms' phenotype leaves dna unaltered affects dna preventing expression genes
epigenetic changes such methylation genes alter likelihood dna transcription produced changes behaviour environment
many epigenetic changes themselves heritable degree
thus while dna itself directly altered environment behavior except through selection relationship genotype phenotype altered even across generations experience within lifetime individual
led calls biology reconsider lamarckian processes evolution light modern advances molecular biology
religious views book philosophie zoologique lamarck referred god sublime author nature
lamarck's religious views examined book lamarck founder evolution 1901 alpheus packard
according packard lamarck's writings may regarded deist
philosopher biology michael ruse described lamarck believing god unmoved mover creator world laws refuses intervene miraculously creation
biographer james moore described lamarck thoroughgoing deist
historian jacques roger written lamarck materialist extent consider necessary recourse any spiritual principle
deism remained vague idea creation prevent believing everything nature including highest forms life result natural processes
legacy statue lamarck léon fagel jardin des plantes paris
lamarck usually remembered belief inheritance acquired characteristics use disuse model organisms developed their characteristics
lamarck incorporated belief theory evolution along other common beliefs time such spontaneous generation
inheritance acquired characteristics also called theory adaptation soft inheritance rejected august weismann 1880 s[note 3] developed theory inheritance germ plasm sex cells later redefined dna remained separate distinct soma rest body thus nothing happens soma may passed germ-plasm
model underlies modern understanding inheritance
lamarck constructed first theoretical frameworks organic evolution
while theory generally rejected during lifetime stephen jay gould argues lamarck primary evolutionary theorist ideas way structured theory set tone much subsequent thinking evolutionary biology through present day
developments epigenetics study cellular physiological traits heritable daughter cells caused changes dna sequence caused debate whether neolamarckist view inheritance correct though lamarck never gave any molecular explanation theory
eva jablonka marion lamb example call themselves neolamarckists
reviewing evidence david haig observes any such mechanisms must themselves evolved through natural selection
charles darwin allowed role use disuse evolutionary mechanism subsidiary natural selection most often respect disuse
[note 4] praised lamarck eminent service arousing attention probability change organic
world being result law miraculous interposition
lamarckism also occasionally used describe quasi-evolutionary concepts societal contexts though lamarck himself
example memetic theory cultural evolution sometimes described form lamarckian inheritance non-genetic traits
