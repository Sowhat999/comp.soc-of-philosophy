ideas hybridity central ideas hybridisation taking up edward said's work describes emergence new cultural forms multiculturalism
instead seeing colonialism something locked past bhabha shows how histories cultures constantly intrude present demanding transform our understanding cross-cultural relations
work transformed study colonialism applying post-structuralist methodologies colonial texts
ambivalence idea ambivalence sees culture consisting opposing perceptions dimensions
bhabha claims ambivalence—this duality presents split identity colonized other—allows beings hybrid their own cultural identity colonizer's cultural identity
ambivalence contributes reason why colonial power characterized belatedness
colonial signifiers authority acquire their meanings after traumatic scenario colonial difference cultural racial returns eye power prior archaic image identity
paradoxically however such image neither 'original'—by virtue act repetition constructs it—nor identical—by virtue difference define
accordingly colonial presence remains ambivalent split appearance original authoritative articulation repetition difference
opens up two dimensions colonial discourse characterized invention mastery displacement fantasy
cultural difference enunciation stereotype bhabha presents cultural difference alternative cultural diversity
cultural diversity culture object empirical knowledge pre-exists knower while cultural difference sees culture point two cultures meet also most problems occur discursively constructed rather pre-given process enunciation culture 'knowledgeable
enunciation act utterance expression culture takes place third space
since culture never pre-given must uttered
through enunciation cultural difference discovered recognized
enunciative process introduces divide traditional stable system reference negation certitude culture articulation new cultural meanings strategies political present practice domination resistance
therefore cultural difference process identification while cultural diversity comparative categorized
moreover possibility difference articulation free signifier skin/culture fixations racial typology however stereotype impedes circulation articulation signifier race anything other
important aspect colonial post-colonial discourse their dependence concept fixity construction otherness
fixity implies repetition rigidity unchanging order well disorder
stereotype depends notion fixity
stereotype creates identity stems much mastery pleasure does anxiety defense dominant form multiple contradictory beliefs recognition difference disavowal
mimicry like bhabha's concept hybridity mimicry metonym presence
mimicry appears members colonized society imitate take culture colonizers
lacan asserts effect mimicry camouflage…it question harmonizing background against mottled background
colonial mimicry comes colonist's desire reformed recognizable other subject difference bhabha writes almost same quite
thus mimicry sign double articulation strategy appropriates other visualizes power
furthermore mimicry sign inappropriate difference recalcitrance coheres dominant strategic function colonial power intensifies surveillance poses imminent threat both 'normalized' knowledges disciplinary powers
way mimicry gives colonial subject partial presence 'colonial' dependent representation within authoritative discourse itself
ironically colonists desire emerge 'authentic' through mimicry—through process writing repetition—through partial representation
other hand bhaba does interpret mimicry narcissistic identification colonizer colonized stops being person without colonizer present identity
sees mimicry double vision disclosing ambivalence colonial discourse also disrupts authority
double vision result [he has] described partial representation/recognition colonial object
figures doubling part-objects metonymy colonial desire alienates modality normality those dominate discourses emerge 'inappropriate colonial subjects
colonists' desire inverted colonial appropriation now produces partial vision colonizer's presence gaze other counterpart colonizer's gaze shares insight genealogical gaze frees marginalized individual breaks unity man's being through extended sovereignty
thus observer becomes observed 'partial' representation rearticulates whole notion identity alienates essence
