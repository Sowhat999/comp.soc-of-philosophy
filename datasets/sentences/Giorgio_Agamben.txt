human beings substance destiny no ethical experience possible

there effect something humans essence nor properly thing simple fact one's own existence possibility potentiality
— reduction life 'biopolitics' main threads agamben's work critical conception homo sacer reduced 'bare life' thus deprived any rights
agamben's concept homo sacer rests crucial distinction greek 'bare life' vita nuda gk
ζωή zoê 'a particular mode life' 'qualified life
part iii section 7 homo sacer “the camp 'nomos' modern” evokes concentration camps world war ii
“the camp space opened state exception begins become rule
agamben says happened camps exceeds outside juridical concept crime specific juridico-political structure those events took place often simply omitted consideration
conditions camps conditio inhumana incarcerated somehow defined outside boundaries humanity under exception laws schutzhaft
law based vague unspecific concepts such race good morals law personal subjectivity judicial agent no longer distinct
“in united states criminal law people accused committing crimes cannot compelled incriminate themselves verbally compelled incriminate themselves physically
process creating state exception these effects compound
realized state exception accused committing crime within legal system loses ability use voice represent themselves
individual deprived their citizenship also any form agency over their own life
“agamben identifies state exception power decision over life
within state exception distinction bios citizen zoe homo sacer made those judicial power
example agamben argue guantánamo bay exemplifies concept 'the state exception' united states following 9–11
agamben mentions basic universal human rights taliban individuals while captured afghanistan sent guantánamo bay 2001 negated us laws
reaction removal their basic human rights detainees guantánamo bay prison went hunger strikes
within state exception detainee placed outside law according agamben reduced 'bare life' eyes judicial powers
[citation needed] here see why such measures hunger strikes occur such places prisons
within framework system deprived individual power their individual basic human freedoms hunger strike seen weapon form resistance
“the body model stand any bounded system
boundaries represent any boundaries threatened precarious
within state exception boundaries power precarious threaten destabilize law one’s humanity well their choice life death
forms resistance extended use power within state exception suggested guantánamo bay prison also operate outside law
case hunger strike prisoners threatened endured force feeding allowing them die
during hunger strikes guantánamo bay prison accusations founded claims forced feedings began surface autumn 2005
february 2006 new york times reported prisoners being force fed guantánamo bay prison march 2006 250 medical experts reported bbc voiced their opinions forced feedings stating breach government’s power against rights prisoners
coming community 1993 coming community published italian 1990 translated english longtime admirer michael hardt 1993 agamben describes social political manifestation philosophical thought
employing diverse short essays describes nature “whatever singularity” “inessential commonality solidarity no way concerns essence”
important note understanding “whatever” being indifference based latin translation “being such matters”
agamben starts off describing “the lovable” love never directed toward property loved being blond being small being tender being lame neither does neglect properties favor insipid generality universal love lover wants loved predicates being such
— same sense agamben talks ease place love rather love experience taking-place whatever singularity resonates use concept use later works
sense ease names perfectly free use proper according expression friedrich hölderlin's most difficult task
— following same trend employs among others following describe “watershed whatever” example particular universal limbo blessed damned homonym concept idea halo potentiality actuality face common proper genus individual threshold inside outside coming community state non-state humanity other themes addressed coming community include commodification body evil messianic
unlike other continental philosophers does reject age-old dichotomies subject/object potentiality/actuality outright rather turns them inside-out pointing out zone become indistinguishable
matter does remain beneath form surrounds halo— political task humanity argues expose innate potential zone indistinguishability
although criticised dreaming impossible certain authors nonetheless shows concrete example whatever singularity acting politically whatever singularity wants appropriate belonging itself own being-in-language thus rejects identity every condition belonging principal enemy state
wherever these singularities peacefully demonstrate their being common there will tiananmen sooner later tanks will appear— homo sacer sovereign power bare life 1995 main work homo sacer sovereign power bare life 1998 giorgio agamben analyzes obscure figure roman law poses fundamental questions nature law power general
under roman empire man committed certain kind crime banned society rights citizen revoked
thus became homo sacer sacred man
consequence killed anybody while life other hand deemed sacred sacrificed ritual ceremony
roman law no longer applied someone deemed homo sacer although remain under spell law
agamben defines human life
included juridical order solely form exclusion capacity killed
homo sacer therefore excluded law itself while being included same time
figure exact mirror image sovereign basileus — king emperor president — stands hand within law condemned e
treason natural person outside law since body politic power suspend law indefinite time
giorgio agamben draws carl schmitt's definition sovereign power decide state exception justitium law indefinitely suspended without being abrogated
schmitt's aim include necessity state emergency under rule law agamben contrary demonstrates life cannot subsumed law
homo sacer state emergency inclusion life necessity juridical order solely form exclusion
[clarification needed] since origins agamben notes law power defining bare life — zoe gk
ζωή opposed bios gk
βίος qualified life — making exclusive operation while same time gaining power over making subject political control
power law actively separate political beings citizens bare life bodies carried antiquity modernity — literally aristotle auschwitz
aristotle agamben notes constitutes political life via simultaneous inclusion exclusion bare life aristotle says man animal born life gk
ζῆν zen existing regard good life εὖ ζῆν eu zen achieved through politics
bare life ancient conception politics must transformed via state good life bare life supposedly excluded higher aims state yet included precisely may transformed good life
sovereignty then conceived ancient times power determines incorporated political body accord bios means originary exclusion exception remain outside political body—which same time source body's composition zoe
according agamben biopower takes bare lives citizens political calculations may marked modern state essentially existed since beginnings sovereignty west since structure ex-ception essential core concept sovereignty
agamben continue expand theory state exception first introduced homo sacer sovereign power bare life ultimately leading state exception 2005
during 2003 delivered lecture european graduate school describing eclipse politics undergone
instead leaving space law life space human action possible space used constitute politics argues politics “contaminated itself law” state exception
because “only human action able cut relationship violence law” becomes increasingly difficult within state exception humanity act against state
state exception 2005 book giorgio agamben traces concept 'state exception' ausnahmezustand used carl schmitt roman justitium auctoritas
leads response carl schmitt's definition sovereignty power proclaim exception
agamben’s text state exception investigates increase power governments employ supposed times crisis
within state emergency agamben refers states exception constitutional rights diminished superseded rejected process claiming extension power government
state exception invests person government power voice authority over others extended well beyond law existed past
“in every case state exception marks threshold logic praxis blur each other pure violence without logos claims realize enunciation without any real reference agamben pg 40
agamben refers continued state exception nazi state germany under hitler’s rule
“the entire third reich considered state exception lasted twelve years
sense modern totalitarianism defined establishment means state exception legal civil war allows physical elimination political adversaries entire categories citizens reason cannot integrated political system agamben pg 2
political power over others acquired through state exception places government — form branch government — powerful operating outside laws
during such times extension power certain forms knowledge shall privileged accepted true certain voices shall heard valued while course many others
oppressive distinction holds great importance relation production knowledge
process both acquiring knowledge suppressing certain knowledge violent act within time crisis
agamben’s state exception investigates how suspension laws within state emergency crisis become prolonged state being
specifically agamben addresses how prolonged state exception operates deprive individuals their citizenship
speaking military order issued president george w
bush 13 november 2001 agamben writes “what new president bush’s order radically erases any legal status individual thus producing legally unnameable unclassifiable being
taliban captured afghanistan enjoy status pow’s defined geneva convention even status people charged crime according american laws agamben pg 3
many individuals captured afghanistan taken held guantánamo bay without trial
these individuals termed “enemy combatants
until 7 july 2006 these individuals treated outside geneva conventions united states administration
auctoritas charisma führertum doctrine agamben shows auctoritas potestas clearly distinct — although form together binary system
quotes mommsen explains auctoritas less order advice
while potestas derives social function auctoritas immediately derives patres personal condition
such akin max weber's concept charisma
why tradition ordered king's death creation sovereign’s wax-double funus imaginarium ernst kantorowicz demonstrated king's two bodies 1957
hence necessary distinguish two bodies sovereign order assure continuity dignitas term used kantorowicz here synonym auctoritas
moreover person detaining auctoritas — sovereign — public life private life become inseparable
augustus first roman emperor claimed auctoritas basis princeps status famous passage res gestae opened up house public eyes
concept auctoritas played key-role fascism nazism particular concerning carl schmitt's theories argues agamben understand modern phenomena such fascist duce nazi führer important forget their continuity principle auctoritas principis {agamben refers here augustus's res gestae}
} neither does duce nor führer represent constitutionally defined public charges even though mussolini hitler endorsed respectively charge head government reich's chancellor just augustus endorsed imperium consulare potestas tribunicia
duce’s führer’s qualities immediately related physical person belong biopolitical tradition auctoritas juridical tradition potestas— thus agamben opposes foucault's concept biopolitics right law defines state exception homo sacer inclusion life right under figure ex-ception simultaneously inclusion exclusion
following walter benjamin's lead explains our task radically differentiate pure violence right instead tying them together carl schmitt
agamben concludes chapter auctoritas potestas writing significative modern specialists inclined admit auctoritas inherent living person pater princeps
evidently ideology fictio aiming groundwork auctoritas preeminence least specific rank compared potestas thus became figure right's {law droit} immanence life
although evident there can't eternal human type incarnate itself each time augustus napoleon hitler less comparable semblables mechanisms {dispositif term often used foucault} state exception justitium auctoritas principis führertum - put use less different circumstances 1930 s overall germany power weber defined charismatic related concept auctoritas elaborated führertum doctrine original personal power leader
1933 short article intending define fundamental concepts national-socialism schmitt defines führung principle root identity leader entourage {identité de souche entre le chef et son entourage} shall note use weberian concepts
— agamben’s thoughts state emergency leads declare difference dictatorship democracy thin indeed rule decree became common starting world war reorganization constitutional balance
agamben often reminds hitler never abrogated weimar constitution suspended whole duration third reich reichstag fire decree issued 28 february 1933
indefinite suspension law characterizes state exception
thus agamben connects greek political philosophy through concentration camps 20 th century fascism even further detainment camps likes guantánamo bay immigration detention centers such bari italy asylum seekers imprisoned football stadiums
these kinds camps entire zones exception being formed state exception becomes status under certain categories people live capture life right
sovereign law makes possible create entire areas application law itself held suspended basis bush administration's definition enemy combatant
interregnum justitium nomos empsuchos sovereign living law chapter preceding auctoritas potestas agamben advances explanation transformation justitium technical term referring state exception declared cope tumultus state rebellion uprising riots
end roman republic term simply referring mourning sovereign's death during interregnum periods correspondence justitium mourning here shows true signification
sovereign living nomos then anomie nomos coincide person without any left-over then anarchy death link attaching law broken threatens unleash itself city must ritualized controlled transformation state exception public mourning mourning justitium
before acquiring modern form decision emergency {schmitt's definition} relationship sovereignty state exception presents itself under form identity sovereign anomie
living law sovereign deeply anomos ἄνομος
here also state exception life secret true law
— first formulation thesis according sovereign living law found treatise law justice pseudo-archytas conserved stobaeus
first attempt conceive form sovereignty completely enfranchised laws being itself source legitimacy
[citation needed] theory must radically distinguished natural rights theory antigone's appeal eternal unwritten laws even monarchs must abide theory sovereignty fact quite reverse antigone's rebellion
pseudo-archytas distinguished sovereign basileus law magistrate archōn limits himself observing law
identification law sovereign consequence writes agamben scission law living law νόμος έμψυχος nomos empsuchos hierarchically superior written law γράμμα gramma subordinate first

study medieval monastic rules agamben offers genealogical approach several concepts ludwig wittgenstein established late philosophy primarily philosophical investigations rule-following form-of-life central importance 'use' wittgenstein 'the meaning word use language' uses 'language' just speak word-language any understandable behaviour
agamben traces earlier versions term 'form-of-life' throughout development monastic life beginning establishment genre written rules fourth century
aim book differentiate 'law' particular use rule opposite implementation law
order sketch out potential concept need 'a theory use western philosophy lacks even most elementary principles'
agamben turns franciscans survey unique historical incident group organising itself rule their life thinking their own lives their own possession communal 'use' looks ways idea developed how eventually lapsed church's law
according reviewer nathan schneider highest poverty examines two medieval christian attempts name eternal life live life beyond reach ordinary politics several centuries monasticism then brief momentous epiphany movement founded francis assisi
each according agamben fails revealing ways
criticism us response 9/11 giorgio agamben particularly critical united states' response september 2001 instrumentalization permanent condition legitimizes state exception dominant paradigm governing contemporary politics
warns against generalization state exception through laws like usa patriot act means permanent installment martial law emergency powers
january 2004 refused give lecture united states because under us-visit required give up biometric information believed stripped state bare life zoe akin tattooing nazis during world war ii
however agamben's criticisms target broader scope us war terror
argues state exception 2005 rule decree become common since world war modern states since then generalized abused
agamben points out general tendency modernity recalling example francis galton alphonse bertillon invented judicial photography anthropometric identification procedure reserved criminals contrary today's society tending toward generalization procedure citizens placing population under permanent suspicion surveillance political body thus become criminal body
agamben notes jews deportation france other occupied countries made possible photos taken identity cards
furthermore agamben's political criticisms open up larger philosophical critique concept sovereignty itself argues intrinsically related state exception
