there list biographies swedenborg available biographies section swedenborg digital library
further reviews swedenborg thought available online encyclopedias veracity swedenborg's transition scientist revelator mystic fascinated many people ever since occurred see list people involved above introduction
swedenborg variety biographers favorable critical
propose fact revelation rather developed theological ideas sources ranging father earlier figures history thought notably plotinus
position first most notably taken swedish writer martin lamm biography swedenborg 1915 still print
olof lagercrantz swedish critic publicist similar point view calling swedenborg's theological writing poem foreign country peculiar laws customs
swedenborg's approach demonstrating veracity theological teachings find use voluminous quotations old testament new testament demonstrate agreement bible word god theological teachings
demonstration agreement found throughout theological writings since rejected blind faith declared true faith internal acknowledgment truth
vast consistent use biblical confirmations swedenborg's theological writings led swedish royal council 1771 examining heresy charges 1770 against two swedish supporters theological writings declare there much true useful swedenborg's writings
scientific beliefs swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during lifetime
youth wanted present new idea every day brother-in-law erik benzelius 1718
around 1730 changed mind instead believed higher knowledge something acquired based intuition
after 1745 instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge spontaneous manner angels
1745 considered himself entered spiritual state tended phrase experiences empirical terms claiming report accurately things experienced spiritual journeys
ideas considered most crucial understanding theology notion correspondences
fact first presented theory correspondences 1744 first volume regnum animale dealing human soul
basis correspondence theory there relationship among natural physical spiritual divine worlds
foundations theory traced neoplatonism philosopher plotinus particular
aid scenario swedenborg now interpreted bible different light claiming even most apparently trivial sentences hold profound spiritual meaning
swedenborg argued presence spiritual sense makes word divine
prophetic accounts four incidents purported psychic ability swedenborg exist literature
there several versions each story
fire anecdotes thursday 19 july 1759 great well-documented fire broke out stockholm sweden
high increasing wind spread very fast consuming 300 houses making 2000 people homeless
fire broke out swedenborg dinner friends gothenburg 400 km stockholm
became agitated party six o'clock there fire stockholm consumed neighbor’s home threatening own
two hours later exclaimed relief fire stopped three doors home
excitement following report word even reached ears provincial governor summoned swedenborg same evening asked detailed recounting
time took two three days news stockholm reach gothenburg courier shortest duration news fire reach gothenburg
first messenger stockholm news fire board trade arrived monday evening
second messenger royal courier arrived tuesday
both these reports confirmed every statement precise hour swedenborg first expressed information
accounts fully described bergquist pp
312–313 chapter 31 swedenborg epic
bergquist states does document swedenborg confirmed vision fire incident good friend consul christopher springer pillars church … man enviable reputation virtue intelligence swedenborg's innkeeper erik bergström heard swedenborg affirming story
seems unlikely many witnesses swedenborg’s distress during fire immediate report provincial governor left room doubt public eye swedenborg’s report
swedenborg received news fire normal methods there no issue psychic perception recorded history
instead news swedenborg's extraordinary vision fire reached capital public curiosity very much aroused
second fire anecdote similar first less cited incident mill owner bolander
swedenborg warned again abruptly incipient fire mills
queen sweden third event 1758 swedenborg visited queen louisa ulrika sweden asked tell her something her deceased brother prince augustus william prussia
next day swedenborg whispered something her ear turned queen pale she explained something she her brother know
lost document fourth incident involved woman lost important document came swedenborg asking recently deceased person tell sources done following night
although typically cited along these three episodes there further piece evidence swedenborg noted seamen ships sailed stockholm london excellent sailing conditions
asked friend swedenborg played down matter saying surprised experience himself certainly able miracles
kant swedenborg 1763 philosopher immanuel kant 1724–1804 then beginning career impressed these accounts made inquiries find out true
also ordered eight volumes expensive arcana cœlestia heavenly arcana heavenly mysteries
charlotte von knobloch kant asking opinion swedenborg’s psychic experiences
kant very affirmative reply referring swedenborg's miraculous gift characterizing reasonable agreeable remarkable sincere scholar letters mendelssohn expressing regret kant never met swedenborg
english friend investigated matter kant including visiting swedenborg’s home found swedenborg sensible pleasant openhearted man here again scholar
however three years later 1766 kant published anonymously small book entitled träume eines geistersehers dreams spirit-seer scathing critique swedenborg writings
termed swedenborg spook hunter without official office occupation
rationale critique kant wanted stop ceaseless questioning inquiries dreams inquisitive persons both known unknown importunate appeals known unknown friends well moon calves
kant also want expose himself mockery
significantly became concerned being seen apologist both swedenborg spiritism guise interest swedenborg might damaged career
dreams intended refutation such thinking
left kant ironic hypocritical position trying free himself ridicule while same time ridiculed swedenborg
however there long suspicion among scholars despite dreams kant actually behind-the-scenes respect swedenborg
certainly there inconsistencies kant's handling issue
instance kant's writing style usually complex labored dry
earnest dreams often playful ironic humorous
2 while mocked swedenborg print preserved notes kant's lectures metaphysics taken student named herder kant treated swedenborg respect sneezed
point herder’s notes term swedenborg's visions quite sublime
3 kant's friend moses mendelssohn thought there joking pensiveness dreams sometimes left reader doubt whether dreams meant make metaphysics laughable spirit-seeking credible
4 letters mendelssohn kant refers dreams less-than-enthusiastically desultory little essay
examples these discrepancies see heron's list original dole corrections
finally case made kant dreams before after knobloch letter accomplished accidentally deliberately falsifying dates documents involved notably knobloch letter
alteration true strengthen case swedenborg’s work being viewed kant last analysis positively
however fact matter difficult determine since key date involved original knobloch letter lost
theology swedenborg claimed heavenly doctrine teachings second coming jesus christ revealed
swedenborg considered theology revelation true christian religion become obfuscated through centuries theology
however refer writings theology since considered based actual experiences unlike theology except title last work
neither wish compare philosophy discipline discarded 1748 because claimed darkens mind blinds us wholly rejects faith
foundation swedenborg's theology laid down arcana cœlestia heavenly mysteries published eight latin volumes 1749 1756
significant portion work interprets biblical passages genesis exodus
reviews says inner spiritual sense these two works word god
later made similar review inner sense book revelation apocalypse revealed
most convinced bible describes human's transformation materialistic spiritual being calls rebirth regeneration
begins work outlining how creation myth account creation earth account man's rebirth regeneration six steps represented six days creation
everything related mankind bible also related jesus christ how christ freed himself materialistic boundaries through glorification human presence making divine
swedenborg examines idea exposition genesis exodus
marriage often discussed aspect swedenborg's writing ideas marriage
swedenborg himself remained bachelor life hinder writing voluminously subject
work marriage love conjugial love older translations 1768 dedicated purpose
central question regard marriage whether stops death continues heaven
question arises due statement jesus’ there no marriage heaven luke 2027–38 matthew 2223–32 mark 1218–27
detailed analysis meant according swedenborg see lord god jesus christ marriage heaven
quality relationship husband wife resumes spiritual world whatever state their death world
thus couple true marriage love remain together state heaven eternity
couple lacking love both partners however will separate after death each will given compatible new partner wish
partner also given person loved ideal marriage never found true partner world
exception both cases person hates chaste marriage thus cannot receive such partner
swedenborg saw creation series pairings descending divine love wisdom define god basis creation
duality seen pairing good truth charity faith god church husband wife
each case goal these pairs achieve conjunction two component parts
case marriage object bring joining together two partners spiritual physical levels happiness comes consequence

unsourced material may challenged removed
august 2013 swedenborg rejected common explanation trinity trinity persons taught early christian church
there instance no mention apostolic writings any son eternity
instead explained theological writings how divine trinity exists person god lord jesus christ taught colossians 29
according heavenly doctrine jesus son god came world due spread evil here
swedenborg spoke virtually works against regarded incomprehensible trinity persons concept
people other religions opposed christianity because doctrine trinity persons
considered separation trinity three separate persons originated first council nicaea athanasian creed
according heavenly doctrine athanasian creed true however trinity understood mean trinity person person being lord god jesus christ
sola fide faith alone heavenly doctrine rejects concept salvation through faith alone sola fide latin since considered both faith charity necessary salvation without other whereas reformers taught faith alone procured justification although must faith resulted obedience
purpose faith according heavenly doctrine lead person life according truths faith charity taught corinthians 1313 james 220
other words swedenborg spoke sharply against faith alone justification based upon imputed righteousness before god achievable gift god's grace sola gratia through faith alone basis person's deeds life
sola fide doctrine averred martin luther john calvin ulrich zwingli others during protestant reformation core belief especially theology lutheran reformers martin luther philip melanchthon
although sola fide reformers also emphasized saving faith effected works faith alone faith alone swedenborg protested against faith alone being instrument justification held salvation possible through conjunction faith charity person purpose faith lead person live according truths faith charity
further states faith charity must exercised doing good out willing good whenever possible good works good uses conjunction perishes
section very evident their epistles never entered mind any apostles church day separate faith charity teaching faith alone justifies saves apart works law charity therefore cannot conjoined faith since faith god charity far expressed works man
separation division introduced christian church divided god three persons ascribed each equal divinity
— true christian religion section 355 later history swedenborg made no attempt found church
few years after death 15 estimate most part england small reading groups formed study teachings
scholar states heavenly doctrine particularly appealed various dissenting groups sprang up first half 18 th century surfeited revivalism narrow-mindedness found optimism comprehensive explanations appealing
variety important cultural figures both writers artists influenced swedenborg's writings including johnny appleseed william blake jorge luis borges daniel burnham arthur conan doyle ralph waldo emerson john flaxman george inness henry james sr
