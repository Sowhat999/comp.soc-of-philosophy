amongst principal concerns 1880 s anatomy brain specifically medulla oblongata
intervened important debates aphasia monograph 1891 zur auffassung aphasien coined term agnosia counselled against too locationist view explanation neurological deficits
like contemporary eugen bleuler emphasized brain function rather brain structure
freud also early researcher field cerebral palsy then known cerebral paralysis
published several medical papers topic showed disease existed long before other researchers period began notice study
also suggested william john little man first identified cerebral palsy wrong lack oxygen during birth being cause
instead suggested complications birth symptom
freud hoped research provide solid scientific basis therapeutic technique
goal freudian therapy psychoanalysis bring repressed thoughts feelings consciousness order free patient suffering repetitive distorted emotions
classically bringing unconscious thoughts feelings consciousness brought encouraging patient talk dreams engage free association patients report their thoughts without reservation make no attempt concentrate while doing
another important element psychoanalysis transference process patients displace onto their analysts feelings ideas derive previous figures their lives
transference first seen regrettable phenomenon interfered recovery repressed memories disturbed patients' objectivity 1912 freud come see essential part therapeutic process
origin freud's early work psychoanalysis linked josef breuer
freud credited breuer opening way discovery psychoanalytical method treatment case anna o
november 1880 breuer called treat highly intelligent 21-year-old woman bertha pappenheim persistent cough diagnosed hysterical
found while nursing her dying father she developed number transitory symptoms including visual disorders paralysis contractures limbs also diagnosed hysterical
breuer began see patient almost every day symptoms increased became persistent observed she entered states absence
found encouragement she fantasy stories her evening states absence her condition improved most her symptoms disappeared april 1881
following death her father month her condition deteriorated again
breuer recorded symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously full recovery achieved inducing her recall events precipitated occurrence specific symptom
years immediately following breuer's treatment anna o
spent three short periods sanatoria diagnosis hysteria somatic symptoms authors challenged breuer's published account cure
richard skues rejects interpretation sees stemming both freudian anti-psychoanalytical revisionism regards both breuer's narrative case unreliable treatment anna o
psychologist frank sulloway contends freud's case histories rampant censorship distortions highly dubious 'reconstructions' exaggerated claims
seduction theory early 1890 s freud used form treatment based breuer described modified called pressure technique newly developed analytic technique interpretation reconstruction
according freud's later accounts period result use procedure most patients mid-1890 s reported early childhood sexual abuse
believed these stories used basis seduction theory then came believe fantasies
explained these first having function fending off memories infantile masturbation later years represented oedipal fantasies stemming innate drives sexual destructive nature
another version events focuses freud's proposing unconscious memories infantile sexual abuse root psychoneuroses letters fliess october 1895 before reported actually discovered such abuse among patients
first half 1896 freud published three papers led seduction theory stating uncovered current patients deeply repressed memories sexual abuse early childhood
these papers freud recorded patients consciously aware these memories must therefore present unconscious memories result hysterical symptoms obsessional neurosis
patients subjected considerable pressure reproduce infantile sexual abuse scenes freud convinced repressed unconscious
patients generally unconvinced their experiences freud's clinical procedure indicated actual sexual abuse
reported even after supposed reproduction sexual scenes patients assured emphatically their disbelief
well pressure technique freud's clinical procedures involved analytic inference symbolic interpretation symptoms trace back memories infantile sexual abuse
claim hundred percent confirmation theory served reinforce previously expressed reservations colleagues validity findings obtained through suggestive techniques
freud subsequently showed inconsistency whether seduction theory still compatible later findings
addendum aetiology hysteria stated true [the sexual abuse children] must remembered time yet freed myself my overvaluation reality my low valuation phantasy
years later freud explicitly rejected claim colleague ferenczi patients’ reports sexual molestation actual memories instead fantasies tried dissuade ferenczi making views public
karin ahbel-rappe concludes her study no longer believe freud abandon seduction theory?’’ freud marked out started down trail investigation nature experience infantile incest impact human psyche then abandoned direction most part
cocaine medical researcher freud early user proponent cocaine stimulant well analgesic
believed cocaine cure many mental physical problems 1884 paper coca extolled virtues
1883 1887 several articles recommending medical applications including use antidepressant
narrowly missed out obtaining scientific priority discovering anesthetic properties aware mentioned passing
karl koller colleague freud's vienna received distinction 1884 after reporting medical society ways cocaine used delicate eye surgery
freud also recommended cocaine cure morphine addiction
introduced cocaine friend ernst von fleischl-marxow become addicted morphine taken relieve years excruciating nerve pain resulting infection acquired while performing autopsy
claim fleischl-marxow cured addiction premature though never acknowledged fault
fleischl-marxow developed acute case cocaine psychosis soon returned using morphine dying few years later after suffering intolerable pain
application anesthetic turned out few safe uses cocaine reports addiction overdose began filter many places world freud's medical reputation became somewhat tarnished
after cocaine episode freud ceased publicly recommend use drug continued take himself occasionally depression migraine nasal inflammation during early 1890 s before discontinuing 1896
period came under influence friend confidant fliess recommended cocaine treatment so-called nasal reflex neurosis
fliess operated noses several own patients also performed operations freud freud's patients whom believed suffering disorder emma eckstein
surgery proved disastrous
unconscious main article unconscious mind concept unconscious central freud's account mind
freud believed while poets thinkers long known existence unconscious ensured received scientific recognition field psychology
concept made informal appearance freud's writings
unconscious first introduced connection phenomenon repression explain happens ideas repressed
freud stated explicitly concept unconscious based theory repression
postulated cycle ideas repressed remain mind removed consciousness yet operative then reappear consciousness under certain circumstances
postulate based upon investigation cases traumatic hysteria revealed cases behavior patients explained without reference ideas thoughts no awareness
fact combined observation such behavior artificially induced hypnosis ideas inserted people's minds suggested ideas operative original cases even though their subjects knew nothing them
freud like josef breuer found hypothesis hysterical manifestations generated ideas warranted given observation
disagreement them arose attempted give causal explanations their data breuer favored hypothesis hypnoid states while freud postulated mechanism defense
richard wollheim comments given close correspondence hysteria results hypnosis breuer's hypothesis appears plausible repression taken account freud's hypothesis becomes preferable
freud originally allowed repression might conscious process time second paper neuro-psychoses defence 1896 apparently believed repression referred psychical mechanism unconscious defense occurred unconscious level
freud further developed theories unconscious interpretation dreams 1899 jokes their relation unconscious 1905 dealt condensation displacement inherent characteristics unconscious mental activity
freud presented first systematic statement hypotheses unconscious mental processes 1912 response invitation london society psychical research contribute proceedings
1915 freud expanded statement ambitious metapsychological paper entitled unconscious
both these papers freud tried distinguish conception unconscious those predated psychoanalysis found postulation ideas simultaneously latent operative
dreams main article dream freud believed function dreams preserve sleep representing fulfilled wishes otherwise awaken dreamer
freud's theory dreams instigated daily occurrences thoughts everyday life
claim function wish fulfillments based account “dreamwork terms transformation secondary process thought governed rules language reality principle primary process unconscious thought governed pleasure principle wish gratification repressed sexual scenarios childhood
order preserve sleep dreamwork disguises repressed “latent content dream interplay words images freud describes terms condensation displacement distortion
produces manifest content dream recounted dream narrative
freud unpleasant manifest content may still represent fulfilment wish level latent content
clinical setting freud encouraged free association dream's manifest content order facilitate access latent content
freud believed interpreting dreams way provide important insights formation neurotic symptoms contribute mitigation their pathological effects
psychosexual development main article psychosexual development freud's theory psychosexual development proposes following initial polymorphous perversity infantile sexuality sexual drives pass through distinct developmental phases oral anal phallic
though these phases then give way latency stage reduced sexual interest activity age five puberty approximately leave greater lesser extent perverse bisexual residue persists during formation adult genital sexuality
freud argued neurosis perversion explained terms fixation regression these phases whereas adult character cultural creativity achieve sublimation their perverse residue
after freud's later development theory oedipus complex normative developmental trajectory becomes formulated terms child's renunciation incestuous desires under phantasised threat phantasised fact case girl castration
dissolution oedipus complex then achieved child's rivalrous identification parental figure transformed pacifying identifications ego ideal assume both similarity difference acknowledge separateness autonomy other
freud hoped prove model universally valid turned ancient mythology contemporary ethnography comparative material arguing totemism reflected ritualized enactment tribal oedipal conflict
id ego super-ego main article id ego super-ego freud proposed human psyche divided three parts id ego super-ego
freud discussed model 1920 essay beyond pleasure principle fully elaborated upon ego id 1923 developed alternative previous topographic schema
conscious unconscious preconscious
id completely unconscious impulsive childlike portion psyche operates pleasure principle source basic impulses drives seeks immediate pleasure gratification
freud acknowledged use term id das es derives writings georg groddeck
super-ego moral component psyche takes account no special circumstances morally right thing may right given situation
rational ego attempts exact balance impractical hedonism id equally impractical moralism super-ego part psyche usually reflected most directly person's actions

concept usually represented iceberg model
model represents roles id ego super ego play relation conscious unconscious thought
freud compared relationship ego id charioteer horses horses provide energy drive while charioteer provides direction
life death drives main articles libido death drive freud believed people driven two conflicting central desires life drive libido eros survival propagation hunger thirst sex death drive
death drive also termed thanatos although freud use term thanatos introduced context paul federn
freud hypothesized libido form mental energy processes structures object-representations invested
prior war freud believes fiction constituted different mode relation death place compensation condition reconciling ourselves death fulfilled namely beneath vicissitudes life permanent life still remains us
beyond pleasure principle freud inferred existence death instinct
premise regulatory principle described principle psychic inertia nirvana principle conservatism instinct
background freud's earlier project scientific psychology defined principle governing mental apparatus tendency divest itself quantity reduce tension zero
freud obliged abandon definition since proved adequate most rudimentary kinds mental functioning replaced idea apparatus tends toward level zero tension idea tends toward minimum level tension
freud effect readopted original definition beyond pleasure principle time applying different principle
asserted certain occasions mind acts though eliminate tension entirely effect reduce itself state extinction key evidence existence compulsion repeat
examples such repetition included dream life traumatic neurotics children's play
phenomenon repetition freud saw psychic trend work over earlier impressions master them derive pleasure them trend prior pleasure principle opposed
addition trend there also principle work opposed thus beyond pleasure principle
repetition necessary element binding energy adaptation carried inordinate lengths becomes means abandoning adaptations reinstating earlier less evolved psychic positions
combining idea hypothesis repetition form discharge freud reached conclusion compulsion repeat effort restore state both historically primitive marked total draining energy death
femininity female sexuality initiating became first debate within psychoanalysis femininity karen horney berlin institute set out challenge freud's account development feminine sexuality
rejecting freud's theories feminine castration complex penis envy horney argued primary femininity penis envy defensive formation rather arising fact injury biological asymmetry freud held
horney influential support melanie klein ernest jones coined term phallocentrism critique freud's position
defending freud against critique feminist scholar jacqueline rose argued presupposes normative account female sexual development given freud
she notes freud moved description little girl stuck her 'inferiority' 'injury' face anatomy little boy account later work explicitly describes process becoming 'feminine' 'injury' 'catastrophe' complexity her earlier psychic sexual life
according freud elimination clitoral sexuality necessary precondition development femininity since immature masculine nature
freud postulated concept vaginal orgasm separate clitoral orgasm achieved external stimulation clitoris
1905 stated clitoral orgasms purely adolescent phenomenon upon reaching puberty proper response mature women change-over vaginal orgasms meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation
theory criticized grounds freud provided no evidence basic assumption because made many women feel inadequate achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone
religion main article freud religion freud regarded monotheistic god illusion based upon infantile emotional need powerful supernatural pater familias
maintained religion once necessary restrain man's violent nature early stages civilization modern times set aside favor reason science
obsessive actions religious practices 1907 notes likeness faith religious belief neurotic obsession
totem taboo 1913 proposes society religion begin patricide eating powerful paternal figure then becomes revered collective memory
these arguments further developed future illusion 1927 freud argued religious belief serves function psychological consolation
freud argues belief supernatural protector serves buffer man's fear nature just belief afterlife serves buffer man's fear death
core idea work religious belief explained through function society relation truth
why according freud religious beliefs illusions
civilization discontents 1930 quotes friend romain rolland described religion oceanic sensation says never experienced feeling
moses monotheism 1937 proposes moses tribal pater familias killed jews psychologically coped patricide reaction formation conducive their establishing monotheist judaism analogously described roman catholic rite holy communion cultural evidence killing devouring sacred father

building behind statue tavistock clinic major psychological health care institution
psychotherapy though first methodology practice individual verbal psychotherapy freud's psychoanalytic system came dominate field early twentieth century forming basis many later variants
while these systems adopted different theories techniques followed freud attempting achieve psychic behavioral change through having patients talk their difficulties
psychoanalysis influential once europe united states though parts world notably latin america influence later 20 th century expanded substantially
also remains influential within many contemporary schools psychotherapy led innovative therapeutic work schools families groups
neo-freudians group including alfred adler otto rank karen horney harry stack sullivan erich fromm rejected freud's theory instinctual drive emphasized interpersonal relations self-assertiveness made modifications therapeutic practice reflected these theoretical shifts
adler originated approach although influence indirect due inability systematically formulate ideas
kovel's view neo-freudian practice shares same assumption most current therapeutic approaches united states wrong people follows directly bad experience then therapy basics nothing good experience corrective
neo-freudian analysis therefore places emphasis patient's relationship analyst less exploration unconscious
carl jung believed collective unconscious reflects cosmic order history human species most important part mind
contains archetypes manifested symbols appear dreams disturbed states mind various products culture
jungians less interested infantile development psychological conflict wishes forces frustrate them integration different parts person
object jungian therapy mend such splits
jung focused particular problems middle later life
objective allow people experience split-off aspects themselves such anima man's suppressed female self animus woman's suppressed male self shadow inferior self-image thereby attain wisdom
jacques lacan approached psychoanalysis through linguistics literature
lacan believed freud's essential work done prior 1905 concerned interpretation dreams neurotic symptoms slips based revolutionary way understanding language relation experience subjectivity ego psychology object relations theory based upon misreadings freud's work
lacan determinative dimension human experience neither self ego psychology nor relations others object relations theory language
lacan saw desire important need considered necessarily ungratifiable
wilhelm reich developed ideas freud developed beginning psychoanalytic investigation then superseded never finally discarded
these concept actualneurosis theory anxiety based upon idea dammed-up libido
freud's original view really happened person actual determined resulting neurotic disposition
freud applied idea both infants adults
former case seductions sought causes later neuroses latter incomplete sexual release
unlike freud reich retained idea actual experience especially sexual experience key significance
1920 s reich taken freud's original ideas sexual release point specifying orgasm criteria healthy function
reich also developing ideas character form later take shape first muscular armour eventually transducer universal biological energy orgone
fritz perls helped develop gestalt therapy influenced reich jung freud
key idea gestalt therapy freud overlooked structure awareness active process moves toward construction organized meaningful wholes
organism environment
these wholes called gestalts patterns involving layers organismic function thought feeling activity
neurosis seen splitting formation gestalts anxiety organism sensing struggle towards creative unification
gestalt therapy attempts cure patients through placing them contact immediate organismic needs
perls rejected verbal approach classical psychoanalysis talking gestalt therapy serves purpose self-expression rather gaining self-knowledge
gestalt therapy usually takes place groups concentrated workshops rather being spread out over long period time extended new forms communal living
arthur janov's primal therapy influential post-freudian psychotherapy resembles psychoanalytic therapy emphasis early childhood experience nevertheless profound differences
while janov's theory akin freud's early idea actualneurosis does dynamic psychology nature psychology like reich perls need primary while wish derivative dispensable need met
despite surface similarity freud's ideas janov's theory lacks strictly psychological account unconscious belief infantile sexuality
while freud there hierarchy danger situations janov key event child's life awareness parents love
janov writes primal therapy ways returned freud's early ideas techniques
frederick crews considers freud key influence upon champions survivorship such ellen bass laura davis co-authors courage heal 1988 although view indebted classic psychoanalysis pre-psychoanalytic freud supposedly took pity hysterical patients found harboring memories early abuse
cured them unknotting their repression
crews sees freud having anticipated recovered memory movement's puritanical alarmism emphasizing mechanical cause-and-effect relations symptomatology premature stimulation body zone another pioneering technique thematically matching patient's symptom sexually symmetrical 'memory
crews believes freud's confidence accurate recall early memories anticipates theories recovered memory therapists such lenore terr view led people being wrongfully imprisoned involved litigation
though there predictions progressive decline support psychodynamic therapies there body research findings support their efficacy treating wide range psychological disorders
science research projects designed test freud's theories empirically led vast literature topic
seymour fisher roger p
greenberg concluded 1977 freud's concepts supported empirical evidence
their analysis research literature supported freud's concepts oral anal personality constellations account role oedipal factors certain aspects male personality functioning formulations relatively greater concern loss love women's compared men's personality economy views instigating effects homosexual anxieties formation paranoid delusions
also found limited equivocal support freud's theories development homosexuality
found several freud's other theories including portrayal dreams primarily containers secret unconscious wishes well views psychodynamics women either supported contradicted research
reviewing issues again 1996 concluded much experimental data relevant freud's work exists supports major ideas theories
fisher greenberg's similar conclusions their extensive earlier volume experimental studies strongly criticised alleged methodological deficiencies paul kline writes accept results their face value almost no consideration methodological adequacy edward erwin
other viewpoints include those hans eysenck writes decline fall freudian empire 1985 freud set back study psychology psychiatry something like fifty years malcolm macmillan concludes freud evaluated freud's method capable yielding objective data mental processes

philosopher donald levy agrees grünbaum's rejection popper’s unfalsifiability thesis applied freud’s theories disputes contention therapeutic success empirical basis stand fall arguing much wider range empirical evidence adduced clinical case material taken consideration
study psychoanalysis united states nathan hale reported decline psychoanalysis psychiatry during years 1965-1985
continuation trend noted alan stone academic psychology becomes 'scientific' psychiatry biological psychoanalysis being brushed aside
paul stepansky while noting psychoanalysis remains influential humanities records vanishingly small number psychiatric residents choose pursue psychoanalytic training nonanalytic backgrounds psychiatric chairpersons major universities among evidence cites conclusion such historical trends attest marginalisation psychoanalysis within american psychiatry
