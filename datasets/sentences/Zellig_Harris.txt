linguistics outset early work 1930 s harris concerned establishing mathematical empirical foundations science language then emerging
saw 'explain' language saussure's parole appeal priori principles competencies langue former provides sole evidence
danger using such undefined intuitive criteria pattern symbol logical prioris linguistics precisely empirical field may enable us derive definitions these intuitive fundamental relationships out correlations observable phenomena
early career influences harris received bachelor's 1930 master's 1932 doctoral 1934 degrees oriental studies department university pennsylvania
although first direction semiticist publications ugaritic phoenician canaanite origins alphabet later hebrew both classical modern began teaching linguistic analysis penn 1931
increasingly comprehensive approach saw practical application part war effort 1940 s
1946-1947 formally established first modern linguistics department united states
harris's early publications brought attention edward sapir strongly influenced came regard intellectual heir
harris also greatly admired leonard bloomfield work person
formally study either
relation bloomfieldian structuralism widely believed harris carried bloomfieldian ideas linguistic description their extreme development investigation discovery procedures phonemes morphemes based distributional properties these units antecedent phonetic elements
methods structural linguistics 1951 definitive formulation descriptive structural work developed up 1945
book made famous generativists sometimes interpreted synthesis neo-bloomfieldian school structuralism
rather harris viewed work articulating methods verifying results however reached validly derived data language
line virtually serious views science time harris's methods corresponded hans reichenbach called context justification distinct context discovery
no sympathy view scientific linguistic analyst must progress stepwise discovery phonetics phonemics morphology without mixing levels
fundamental approach indeed making possible harris' recognition phonemic contrast cannot derived distributional analysis phonetic notations rather fundamental data linguistics speakers' judgments phonemic contrast
developed clarified methods controlled experiment employing substitution tests such pair test harris 195132 informants distinguish repetition contrast
probably accurate say phonetic data regarded fundamental other approaches linguistics
example chomsky 196478 assume[s] each utterance any language uniquely represented sequence phones each regarded abbreviation set features
recognizing primacy speaker perceptions contrast enabled remarkable flexibility creativity harris's linguistic analyses others - without improved foundation - labelled game playing hocus-pocus
henry hoenigswald tells us late 1940 s 1950 s harris viewed colleagues person exploring consequences pushing methodological principles right edge
close co-worker put zellig harris's work linguistics placed great emphasis methods analysis
theoretical results product prodigious amounts work data language economy description major criterion
kept introduction constructs minimum necessary bring together elements description system
own role simply agent bringing data relation data
false modesty made harris downplay particular role bringing results much fundamental belief objectivity methods employed
language described terms placings words next words
there nothing else no external metalanguage
question how these placings worked themselves vehicle carrying 'semantic burden' language
commitment methods such fair say methods leader follower
genius see various crucial points methods leading analytic work necessary bring them new result
then extension refinement distributional methodology pioneered sapir bloomfield investigating elements language co-occur cannot
given representation contrasting utterances non-repetitions written differently even conventional alphabetic orthography stochastic procedures amenable statistical learning theory identify boundaries words morphemes
practice course linguists identify words morphemes variety intuitive heuristic means
these again substitution tests
given words morphemes general method experimental follows substitute element string such elements others context being held constant then test acceptability new combination either finding corpus testing acceptability users language
harris's experimental distributional methodology thus grounded subjective judgments language users judgments repetition vs
imitation yielding fundamental data phonemic contrast judgments acceptability
substitution tests using these judgments criteria identify departures randomness enable language carry information
contrast commonly held view harris like bloomfield rejected mentalism espoused behaviorism
major contributions 1940 s harris's contributions linguistics 1945 summarized methods structural linguistics harris 1951 include componential analysis long components phonology componential analysis morphology discontinuous morphemes substitution-grammar word- phrase-expansions related immediate-constituent analysis without limitations
manuscript date january 1946 book recognized including first formulation notion generative grammar
overriding aim book import word methods original title detailed specification validation criteria linguistic analysis
these criteria lend themselves differing forms presentation sometimes taken competing
harris showed how complementary
analogy may drawn intersecting parameters optimality theory
grammar another these analyses sentences exhibit simultaneously these properties
harris's treatment these tools analysis rather theories language way using them work toward optimal presentation purpose contributed perception engaged hocus-pocus no expectation there any absolute truth matter
harris's central methodological concern beginning earliest publications avoid obscuring essential characteristics language behind unacknowledged presuppositions such inherent conventions notation presentation
vein among most illuminating works 1940 s restatements analyses other linguists done intention displaying properties linguistic phenomena invariant across diverse representations anticipates later work linguistic universals
also very relevant here work transfer grammar presents intersection grammars two languages clarifying precisely those features differ relation corresponding such features
obvious benefits machine translation
metalanguage notational systems basis methodological concern unacknowledged presuppositions such inherent conventions notation presentation dependent upon prior knowledge use language
since object investigation language itself properties language cannot presupposed without question-begging
cannot describe structure natural language other kind system any system identify elements meanings given language already same essential structure words sentences language described
[w]e cannot general impose our own categories information upon language
cannot determine 'a priori' way 'logical form' sentences
natural language demonstrably contains own metalanguages talk language itself
any other means talking language such logical notations depends upon our prior shared 'common parlance' our learning interpreting
describe language write grammar cannot rely upon metalinguistic resources outside intrinsic metalinguistic resources within language any system identify elements meanings given language already same essential structure words sentences language described
there no way define describe language occurrences except such statements same language another natural language
even grammar language stated largely symbols those symbols will defined ultimately natural language
observation there followed harris's conclusion science aims determine nature language limited investigation relationships elements language another their distribution
indeed beginning fundamental data linguistics phonemic contrasts elements defined relative another
any metalinguistic notions representations notational conventions stateable metalanguage assertions language itself import complexity intrinsic language obscuring true character
because harris strove 'least grammar'
reason demand every entity rule every complexity restriction domains rule states departure randomness language being described
since describe restriction combinations language description should add restrictions own
hypothesis universal grammar ug amounts contrary proposal metalinguistic resources language fact priori prior external language part genetic inheritance humans
insofar evidence properties ug language itself harris's view such properties cannot presupposed may sought once principled theory language established purely linguistic basis
linguistics applied mathematics deriving insight harris's aim apply tools mathematics data language establish foundations science language
[the] problem foundations mathematics topical ever just time harris took charge 'homologous' enterprise establishing linguistics clear basis
see here then nearly fifty years during realize program established very early zellig harris searched found mathematics supports
merits closer attention doubtless advisable consider without shutting reductive box 'possible applications mathematics linguistics
question rather 'how little mathematics transmute itself linguistics?' contrasted attempts others project properties language formal language-like systems
investigating mathematically definable system relation language being generalization subset formulating mathematical system properties relations necessary sufficient whole natural language
transformational structure language early 1939 harris began teaching students linguistic transformations
immediate utility enhance regularity repetition patterns texts discourse analysis
1946 already done extensive transformational analysis diverse languages such kota hidatsa cherokee course hebrew ancient modern well english feel ready publication until culture style discourse analysis papers 1952
later series papers beginning co-occurrence transformations linguistic structure 1957 developed general theory syntax
harris argued following sapir bloomfield semantics included grammar separate form information being two faces same coin
particular application concern presuppositions metalanguage noted above any specification semantics other immanent language stated metalanguage external language call own syntactic description semantic interpretation
prior harris's discovery transformations grammar far developed yet treat individual word combinations word classes
sequence ntuple word classes plus invariant morphemes termed constants specifies subset sentences formally alike
harris investigated mappings such subset another set sentences
linear algebra mapping preserves specified property called transformation sense harris introduced term linguistics
harris's transformational analysis refined word classes found 1946 morpheme utterance grammar expansions
recursively defining semantically specific subclasses according combinatorial privileges words may progressively approximate grammar individual word combinations
relation progressive refinement subsequently shown direct straightforward way grammar substring combinability resulting string analysis harris 1962
noam chomsky harris's student beginning undergraduate 1946
rather taking transformations algebraic sense mappings subset subset preserving inter-word restrictions chomsky adapted notion rules transformation vs
rules formation mathematical logic
terms originated rudolf carnap
also introduced symbol-rewriting rules post production systems invented years earlier emil post
their capacity generate language-like formal systems beginning employed design computing machines such eniac announced penn great fanfare giant brain 1946
chomsky employed rewrite rules notation presentation immediate-constituent analysis
called phrase structure grammar psg
set restate harris's transformations operations mapping phrase-structure tree another
conception psg provided rules formation ‘enriched′ rules transformation
led later redefinition transformations operations mapping abstract deep structure surface structure
very different notion transformation creates complex hierarchy abstract structure harris showed unnecessary undesirable
inter-word dependencies suffice determine transformations mappings set sentences many generalizations seem importance various theories employing abstract syntax trees such island phenomena fall out naturally harris's analysis no special explanation needed
practice linguists take unnumbered short cuts intuitive heuristic guess keep many problems particular language before them same time
early work transformations used paraphrase heuristic keeping methodological principles noted above section metalanguage issues earlier there also formal criterion transformational analysis
1957 co-occurrence transformation paper criterion inter-word co-occurrence restrictions should preserved under mapping two sentence-forms transforms then acceptable word choices also obtain other
even while 1957 publication press clear preservation word co-occurrence resolve certain problems 1965 transformational theory criterion refined difference acceptability found pair sentences satisfy sentence-form corresponding satisfiers other sentence-form likewise differentiated though contexts e
under imagined dreamt acceptability-differences may collapsed
these acceptability gradings may also expressed ranges contexts word choices fully acceptable formulation leads naturally sublanguage grammar below
operator grammar harris factored set transformations elementary sentence-differences then employed operations generative processes decomposing synthesizing sentences
these two kinds incremental operations add words paraphrastic operations change phonemic shapes words
latter harris termed extended morphophonemics
led partition set sentences two sublanguages informationally complete sublanguage neither ambiguity nor paraphrase vs
set conventional usable paraphrases two systems grammar report paraphrase 1969
paraphrastic set morphemes may present reduced form even reduced zero their fully explicit forms recoverable undoing deformations reductions phonemic shape
thence parallel generalization linear algebra operator theory mathematics developed operator grammar
here last grammar entry individual words construction sentence
entry operator word argument places words relationship another given reduction requires may carried out
reductions rarely obligatory
operator entry trivial formalize
resembles predicate calculus affinities categorial grammar these findings after fact guide development research led
recent work stephen johnson formalization operator grammar adapts lexicon grammar maurice gross complex detail reductions
sublanguage linguistic information work sublanguage analysis harris showed how sublanguage restricted domain pre-existent external metalanguage expressed sentences language outside sublanguage something available language whole
language whole restrictions operator-argument combinability specified terms relative acceptability difficult rule out any satisfier attested sentence-form nonsense technical domains especially sublanguages science metalanguage definitions terms relations restrict word combinability correlation form meaning becomes quite sharp
perhaps interest test exemplification form information science 1989 vindicates degree sapir–whorf hypothesis
also expresses harris's lifelong interest further evolution refinement language context problems social amelioration e
language international cooperation scientific sublanguages prospects global language science possible future developments language beyond present capacities
harris's linguistic work culminated companion books grammar english mathematical principles 1982 theory language information
mathematical information theory concerns quantity information exactly efficiency communication channels here first time theory information content
latter work also harris ventured propose last might truth matter nature language required learn origin possible future development
discoveries vindicate sapir's recognition long disregarded language pre-eminently social artifact users collectively create re-create course using
