purpose against heresies refute teachings various gnostic groups apparently several greek merchants begun oratorial campaign irenaeus' bishopric teaching material world accidental creation evil god escape pursuit gnosis
irenaeus argued true gnosis fact knowledge christ redeems rather escapes bodily existence
until discovery library nag hammadi 1945 against heresies best-surviving description gnosticism
according biblical scholars findings nag hammadi shown irenaeus' description gnosticism largely inaccurate polemic nature
though correct details belief systems various groups irenaeus' main purpose warn christians against gnosticism rather catalog those beliefs
described gnostic groups sexual libertines example their own writings advocated chastity strongly orthodox texts—yet gnostic texts cannot taken guides their actual practices almost nothing reliably known today
any case gnostics single group wide array sects
groups indeed libertine because considered bodily existence meaningless others praise chastity strongly prohibited any sexual activity even within marriage
rodney stark asserts same nag hammadi library proves irenaeus right
irenaeus also demonstration apostolic preaching also known proof apostolic preaching armenian copy discovered 1904
work seems instruction recent christian converts
eusebius attests other works irenaeus today lost including ogdoad untitled letter blastus regarding schism subject knowledge monarchy how god cause evil
irenaeus exercised wide influence generation followed
both hippolytus tertullian freely drew writings
however none works aside against heresies demonstration apostolic preaching survive today perhaps because literal hope earthly millennium may made uncongenial reading greek east
even though no complete version against heresies original greek exists possess full ancient latin version probably third century well thirty-three fragments syrian version complete armenian version books 4 5
irenaeus' works first translated english john keble published 1872 part library fathers series
scripture see also development new testament canon irenaeus pointed scripture proof orthodox christianity against heresies classifying scripture old testament most books now known new testament while excluding many works large number gnostics flourished 2 nd century claimed scriptural authority
oftentimes irenaeus student polycarp direct disciple apostle john believed interpreting scriptures same hermeneutic apostles
connection christ important irenaeus because both gnostics based their arguments scripture
irenaeus argued since trace authority christ gnostics interpretation scripture correct
also used rule faith proto-creed similarities apostles' creed hermeneutical key argue interpretation scripture correct
before irenaeus christians differed gospel preferred
christians asia minor preferred gospel john
gospel matthew most popular overall
irenaeus asserted four gospels matthew mark luke john canonical scripture
thus irenaeus provides earliest witness assertion four canonical gospels possibly reaction marcion's edited version gospel luke marcion asserted true gospel
based arguments irenaeus made support four authentic gospels interpreters deduce fourfold gospel must still novelty irenaeus' time
against heresies 3
7 acknowledges many heterodox christians use gospel while 3
9 acknowledges use four
success tatian's diatessaron same time period
powerful indication fourfold gospel contemporaneously sponsored irenaeus broadly let alone universally recognized
irenaeus also earliest attestation gospel john written john apostle gospel luke written luke companion paul
apologist ascetic tatian previously harmonized four gospels single narrative diatesseron c 150–160
scholars[specify] contend irenaeus quotes 21 27 new testament texts matthew book 3 chapter 16 mark book 3 chapter 10 luke book 3 chapter 14 john book 3 chapter acts apostles book 3 chapter 14 romans book 3 chapter 16 corinthians book chapter 3 2 corinthians book 3 chapter 7 galatians book 3 chapter ephesians book 5 chapter 2 philippians book 4 chapter 18 colossians book chapter 3 thessalonians book 5 chapter 6 2 thessalonians book 5 chapter 25 timothy book preface 2 timothy book 3 chapter 14 titus book 3 chapter 3 peter book 4 chapter 9 john book 3 chapter 16 2 john book chapter 16 revelation john book 4 chapter 20 may refer hebrews book 2 chapter 30 james book 4 chapter 16 maybe even 2 peter book 5 chapter 28 does cite philemon 3 john jude
[citation needed] irenaeus cited new testament approximately 1000 times
third citations made paul's letters
irenaeus considered 13 letters belonging pauline corpus written paul himself
apostolic authority irenaeus also known first theologians use principle apostolic succession refute opponents

succession important establish chain custody orthodoxy
felt important however also speak succession elders presbyters
irenaeus' point refuting gnostics apostolic churches preserved same traditions teachings many independent streams
unanimous agreement these many independent streams transmission proved orthodox faith current those churches true
irenaeus' theology contrast gnosticism central point irenaeus' theology unity goodness god opposition gnostics' theory god number divine emanations aeons along distinction monad demiurge
irenaeus uses logos theology inherited justin martyr
irenaeus student polycarp tutored john apostle
john used logos terminology gospel john letter john
irenaeus prefers speak son spirit hands god
unity salvation history irenaeus' emphasis unity god reflected corresponding emphasis unity salvation history
irenaeus repeatedly insists god began world overseeing ever since creative act everything happened part plan humanity
essence plan process maturation irenaeus believes humanity created immature god intended creatures take long time grow assume divine likeness
everything happened since therefore planned god help humanity overcome initial mishap achieve spiritual maturity
world intentionally designed god difficult place human beings forced make moral decisions way mature moral agents
irenaeus likens death big fish swallowed jonah depths whale's belly jonah turn god act according divine will
similarly death suffering appear evils without them never come know god
according irenaeus high point salvation history advent jesus
irenaeus incarnation christ intended god before determined humanity created
irenaeus develops idea based rom
514 saying forinasmuch pre-existence saving being necessary might saved should also called existence order being saves should exist vain
theologians maintain irenaeus believed incarnation occurred even humanity never sinned fact sin determined role savior
irenaeus sees christ new adam systematically undoes adam thus adam disobedient concerning god's edict concerning fruit tree knowledge good evil christ obedient even death wood tree
irenaeus first draw comparisons eve mary contrasting faithlessness former faithfulness latter
addition reversing wrongs done adam irenaeus thinks christ recapitulating summing up human life
irenaeus conceives our salvation essentially coming through incarnation god man
characterizes penalty sin death corruption
god however immortal incorruptible simply becoming united human nature christ conveys those qualities us spread like benign infection
irenaeus emphasizes salvation occurs through christ's incarnation bestows incorruptibility humanity rather emphasizing redemptive death crucifixion although latter event integral part former
christ's life part process recapitulation christ go through every stage human life infancy old age simply living sanctify divinity
although sometimes claimed irenaeus believed christ die until older conventionally portrayed bishop lyons simply pointed out because jesus turned permissible age becoming rabbi 30 years old above recapitulated sanctified period 30 50 years old per jewish custom periodization human life touches beginning old age becomes 50 years old
see adversus haereses book ii chapter
passage adversus haereses under consideration irenaeus clear after receiving baptism age thirty citing luke 323 gnostics then falsely assert [jesus] preached year reckoning baptism also completing thirtieth year [jesus] suffered being fact still young man no means attained advanced age
irenaeus argues against gnostics using scripture show jesus lives least several years after baptism referencing 3 distinctly separate visits jerusalem
first jesus makes wine out water goes up paschal feast-day after withdraws found samaria
second jesus goes up jerusalem passover cures paralytic after withdraws over sea tiberias
third mention travels jerusalem eats passover suffers following day
irenaeus quotes scripture reference john 857 suggest jesus ministers while 40's
passage jesus' opponents want argue jesus seen abraham because jesus too young
jesus' opponents argue jesus yet 50 years old
irenaeus argues jesus thirties opponents would've argued he's yet 40 years since make even younger
irenaeus' argument weaken their own argument adding years jesus' age
irenaeus also writes elders witness asia conferred john lord's disciple effect john delivered these things unto them abode them until times trajan
them saw john others also apostles same account them witness aforesaid relation

refuting gnostic claims jesus preached year after baptism irenaeus used recapitulation approach demonstrate living beyond age thirty christ sanctified even old age
irenaeus' use paul's epistles many aspects irenaeus' presentation salvation history depend paul's epistles
irenaeus’ conception salvation relies heavily understanding found paul’s letters
irenaeus first brings up theme victory over sin evil afforded jesus’s death
god’s intervention saved humanity fall adam wickedness satan
human nature become joined god’s person jesus thus allowing human nature victory over sin
paul writes same theme christ come new order formed being under law being under sin adam rom
614 gal
reconciliation also theme paul’s irenaeus stresses teachings salvation
irenaeus believes jesus coming flesh blood sanctified humanity might again reflect perfection associated likeness divine
perfection leads new life lineage god forever striving eternal life unity father
carryover paul attributes reconciliation actions christ “for since death came through human being resurrection dead also come through human being die adam will made alive christ” cor
third theme both paul’s irenaeus’s conceptions salvation sacrifice christ being necessary new life given humanity triumph over evil
obedient sacrifice jesus victor reconciler thus erasing marks adam left human nature
argue against gnostics point irenaeus uses colossians col
213-4 showing debt came tree paid us another tree
furthermore first chapter ephesians picked up irenaeus's discussion topic asserts “by own blood redeemed us also apostle declares ‘in whom redemption through blood even remission sins
’ irenaeus does simply parrot back message paul understanding salvation
major changes irenaeus makes parousia will occur
paul states believes going happen soon probably own life time thess
415 cor
however end times does happen immediately christians begin worry doubts faith
irenaeus sin seen haste just adam eve quickly ate tree knowledge pleased
other hand redemption restored humanity through christ's submission god’s will
thus salvation man will also restored original trajectory controlled god forfeited humanity's sinful haste
rather slower version salvation something irenaeus received paul necessary construct given delay second coming jesus
christ new adam counter gnostic opponents irenaeus significantly develops paul's presentation christ last adam
irenaeus' presentation christ new adam based paul's christ-adam parallel romans 512-21
irenaeus uses parallel demonstrate christ truly took human flesh
irenaeus consideres important emphasize point because understands failure recognize christ's full humanity bond linking various strains gnosticism together seen statement according opinion no heretics word god made flesh
irenaeus believes unless word became flesh humans fully redeemed
explains becoming man christ restored humanity being image likeness god lost fall man just adam original head humanity through whom sinned christ new head humanity fulfills adam's role economy salvation
irenaeus calls process restoring humanity recapitulation
irenaeus paul's presentation old law mosaic covenant passage indicates old law revealed humanity's sinfulness save them
explains law spiritual merely made sin stand out relief destroy
sin no dominion over spirit over man
since humans physical nature cannot saved spiritual law
instead need human savior
why necessary christ take human flesh
irenaeus summarizes how christ's taking human flesh saves humanity statement closely resembles romans 519 disobedience man originally moulded virgin soil many made sinners forfeited life necessary obedience man originally born virgin many should justified receive salvation
physical creation adam christ emphasized irenaeus demonstrate how incarnation saves humanity's physical nature
irenaeus emphasizes importance christ's reversal adams's action
through obedience christ undoes adam's disobedience
irenaeus presents passion climax christ's obedience emphasizing how obedience tree cross phil
28 undoes disobedience occurred through tree gen
irenaeus' interpretation paul's discussion christ new adam significant because helped develop recapitulation theory atonement
irenaeus emphasizes through christ's reversal adam's action humanity saved rather considering redemption occur cultic juridical way
valentinian gnosticism valentinian gnosticism major forms gnosticism irenaeus opposed
according gnostic view salvation creation perfect begin need time grow mature
valentinians material world result loss perfection resulted sophia's desire understand forefather
therefore ultimately redeemed through secret knowledge enter pleroma achamoth originally fell
according valentinian gnostics there three classes human beings
material cannot attain salvation psychic strengthened works faith part church spiritual cannot decay harmed material actions
essentially ordinary humans—those faith possess special knowledge—will attain salvation
spirituals other hand—those obtain great gift—are class will eventually attain salvation
article entitled demiurge j
arendzen sums up valentinian view salvation man
writes first carnal men will return grossness matter finally consumed fire second psychic men together demiurge their master will enter middle state neither heaven pleroma nor hell whyle purely spiritual men will completely freed influence demiurge together saviour achamoth spouse will enter pleroma divested body húle soul psuché
understanding salvation purpose incarnation redeem spirituals their material bodies
taking material body son becomes savior facilitates entrance pleroma making possible spirituals receive spiritual body
however becoming body soul son himself becomes those needing redemption
therefore word descends onto savior baptism jordan liberates son corruptible body soul
redemption body soul then applied spirituals
response gnostic view christ irenaeus emphasized word became flesh developed soteriology emphasized significance christ's material body saving humanity discussed sections above
criticism gnosticism irenaeus made reference gnostic gospel portrayed judas positive light having acted accordance jesus' instructions
recently discovered gospel judas dates close period irenaeus lived late 2 nd century scholars typically regard work many gnostic texts showing many varieties gnostic beliefs period
irenaeus' mariology irenaeus lyons perhaps earliest church fathers develop thorough mariology
certain while still very young irenaeus seen heard bishop polycarp
155 smyrna
irenaeus sets out forthright account mary's role economy salvation presenting mary new eve whose obedience annunciation counters eve's disobedience
states even though eve adam husband she still virgin
disobeying eve became cause death herself whole human race
same way mary though she husband still virgin obeying she became cause salvation herself whole human race
presentation mary new eve extension irenaeus' adam-christ typology
just christ undoes adam's disobedience mary undoes eve's disobedience
emphasis role mary helps irenaeus counter christologies along lines docetism adoptionism
emphasis mary's role economy salvation further demonstrates how god transforms material world through incarnation important part irenaeus' conflict gnostics
like ireneaus tertullian describes how christ's virgin birth parallels adam's creation virgin earth
tertullian also discusses how necessary god born virgin lost through woman saved through woman
indicates concept mary new eve known both eastern western church during second third centuries
prophetic exegesis first four books against heresies constitute minute analysis refutation gnostic doctrines
fifth statement positive belief contrasting constantly shifting contradictory gnostic opinions steadfast faith church
appeals prophecies demonstrate truthfulness christianity
rome ten horns irenaeus shows close relationship predicted events daniel 2 7

666 irenaeus first church fathers consider mystic number 666
while irenaeus propose solutions numerical riddle interpretation quite reserved
thus cautiously states knowing sure number declared scripture six hundred sixty six let them await first place division kingdom ten then next place these kings reigning beginning set their affairs order advance their kingdom [let them learn] acknowledge shall come claiming kingdom himself shall terrify those men whom speaking name containing aforesaid number truly abomination desolation
although irenaeus speculate upon three names symbolize mystical number namely euanthas teitan lateinos nevertheless content believe antichrist arise time future after fall rome then meaning number revealed
millennium see also millennialism irenaeus declares antichrist's future three-and-a-half-year reign sits temple jerusalem will terminated second advent resurrection just destruction wicked millennial reign righteous
general resurrection judgment follow descent new jerusalem end millennial kingdom
irenaeus calls those heretics maintain saved immediately glorified kingdom come after death before their resurrection
avers millennial kingdom resurrection actualities allegories first resurrection introducing promised kingdom risen saints described ruling over renewed earth during millennium two resurrections
irenaeus held old jewish tradition first six days creation week typical first six thousand years human history antichrist manifesting himself sixth period
expected millennial kingdom begin second coming christ destroy wicked inaugurate righteous reign kingdom god during seventh thousand years millennial sabbath signified sabbath creation week
common many fathers irenaeus distinguish new earth re-created eternal state—the thousand years revelation 20—when saints christ after second advent jewish traditions messianic kingdom
hence applies biblical traditional ideas descriptions earth during millennium throughout closing chapters book 5
conception reign resurrected translated saints christ earth during millennium-popularly known chiliasm—was increasingly prevailing belief time
incipient distortions due admixture current traditions figure extreme forms chiliasm caused reaction against earlier interpretations bible prophecies
