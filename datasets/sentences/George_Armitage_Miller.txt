major contributions miller's career started during reign behaviorism psychology
behaviorists questioned whether mental thought processes fit scientific study being observable
focused working responses stimuli particularly among other animals
miller disagreed
jerome bruner noam chomsky considered founders field cognitive psychology replaced behaviorism framework analyzing mind
working memory days william james psychologists idea memory consisted short-term long-term memory
while short-term memory expected limited exact limits known
1956 miller quantify capacity limit paper magical number seven plus minus two
tested immediate memory via tasks such asking person repeat set digits presented absolute judgment presenting stimulus label asking them recall label later span attention asking them count things group few items quickly
three cases miller found average limit seven items
mixed feelings focus work exact number seven quantifying short-term memory felt misquoted often
stated introducing paper research first time being persecuted integer
miller also found humans remembered chunks information interrelating bits using scheme limit applied chunks
miller himself saw no relationship among disparate tasks immediate memory absolute judgment lumped them fill one-hour presentation
results influenced budding field cognitive psychology
word net many years starting 1986 miller directed development word net large computer-readable electronic reference usable applications such search engines
wordnet large lexical database representing human semantic memory english
fundamental building block synset collection synonyms representing concept idea
words multiple synsets
entire class synsets grouped nouns verbs adjectives adverbs separately links existing within these four major groups them
going beyond thesaurus word net also includes inter-word relationships such part/whole relationships hierarchies inclusion
although intended dictionary wordnet many short definitions added time went
miller colleagues planned tool test psycholinguistic theories how humans use understand words
miller also later worked closely developers simpli
com inc
meaning-based keyword search engine based word net
wordnet proved extremely influential international scale
now emulated wordnets many different languages
language psychology computation miller considered founders psycholinguistics links language cognition psychology analyze how people use create language
1951 book language communication considered seminal field
later book science words also focused language psychology
published papers along noam chomsky mathematics computational aspects language syntax two new areas study
miller also researched how people understood words sentences same problem faced artificial speech-recognition technology
book plans structure behavior 1960 written eugene galanter karl h
pribram explored how humans plan act trying extrapolate how robot programmed plan things
miller also known coining miller's law order understand another person saying you must assume true try imagine true
books miller authored several books many considered first major works their respective fields
language communication 1951 miller's language communication first significant texts study language behavior
book scientific study language emphasizing quantitative data based mathematical model claude shannon's information theory
used probabilistic model imposed learning-by-association scheme borrowed behaviorism miller yet attached pure cognitive perspective
first part book reviewed information theory physiology acoustics phonetics speech recognition comprehension statistical techniques analyze language
focus speech generation recognition
second part psychology idiosyncratic differences across people language use developmental linguistics structure word associations people use symbolism language social aspects language use
reviewing book charles e
osgood classified book graduate-level text based objective facts theoretical constructs
thought book verbose topics too brief others directly related author's expertise area
also critical miller's use simple skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning explain human language acquisition use
approach per osgood made impossible analyze concept meaning idea language consisting representational signs
find book objective emphasis facts over theory depicting clearly application information theory psychology
plans structure behavior 1960 plans structure behavior miller co-authors tried explain through artificial-intelligence computational perspective how animals plan act
radical break behaviorism explained behavior set sequence stimulus-response actions
authors introduced planning element controlling such actions
saw plans being executed based input using stored inherited information environment called image using strategy called test-operate-test-exit tote
image essentially stored memory past context akin tolman's cognitive map
tote strategy initial test phase compared input against image there incongruity operate function attempted reduce
cycle repeated till incongruity vanished then exit function invoked passing control another tote unit hierarchically arranged scheme
peter milner review canadian journal psychology noted book short concrete details implementing tote strategy
also critically viewed book being able tie model details neurophysiology molecular level
per book covered brain gross level lesion studies showing regions possibly implement tote strategies without giving reader indication how region implement strategy
psychology communication 1967 miller's 1967 work psychology communication collection seven previously published articles
first information memory dealt chunking presenting idea separating physical length number items presented learned psychological length number ideas recipient manages categorize summarize items
capacity short-term memory measured units psychological length arguing against pure behaviorist interpretation since meaning items beyond reinforcement punishment central psychological length
second essay paper magical number seven
third 'the human link communication systems' used information theory idea channel capacity analyze human perception bandwidth
essay concluded how much impinges us absorb knowledge limited each property stimulus handful items
paper psycholinguists described how effort both speaking understanding sentence related how much self-reference similar-structures-present-inside there sentence broken down clauses phrases
book general used chomskian view seeing language rules grammar having biological basis—disproving simple behaviorist idea language performance improved reinforcement—and using tools information computation place hypotheses sound theoretical framework analyze data practically efficiently
miller specifically addressed experimental data refuting behaviorist framework concept level field language cognition
noted qualified behaviorism level cognition overthrow other spheres psychology
