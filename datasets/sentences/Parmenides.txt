pupil xenophanes regardless whether actually knew each other xenophanes' philosophy most obvious influence parmenides
diogenes laërtius also describes parmenides disciple ameinias son diochaites pythagorean there no obvious pythagorean elements thought
however according sir william smith dictionary greek roman biography mythology 1870 others content themselves reckoning parmenides well zeno belonging pythagorean school speaking parmenidean life same way pythagorean life spoken even censorious timon allows parmenides high-minded man while plato speaks veneration aristotle others give unqualified preference over rest eleatics
career first hero cult philosopher know parmenides' dedication heroon teacher ameinias elea
parmenides founder school elea also included zeno elea melissus samos
life elea written laws city
most important pupil zeno according plato 25 years junior regarded eromenos
parmenides large influence plato named dialogue parmenides after spoke veneration

former path convince ourselves existent neither come being nor perishable entirely sort without change limit neither past nor future entirely included present

similar arguments divisibility motion change also infinity shut out absolutely existent latter represented shut up itself may compared well-rounded ball while thought appropriated positive definition
thought thought object coinciding corresponding passages plato aristotle theophrastus others authenticate view theory

nature parmenides most significant pre-socratic philosophers
known work conventionally titled nature poem survived fragmentary form
approximately 160 verses poem remain today probable eight hundred verses
work originally divided three parts proem greek προοίμιον introduced entire work section known way truth aletheia ἀλήθεια section known way appearance/opinion doxa δόξα
proem narrative sequence narrator travels beyond beaten paths mortal men receive revelation unnamed goddess generally thought persephone dikē nature reality
aletheia estimated 90% survived doxa most no longer exists then presented spoken revelation goddess without any accompanying narrative
parmenides attempted distinguish unity nature variety insisting way truth upon reality unity therefore object knowledge upon unreality variety therefore object knowledge opinion
way opinion propounded theory world seeming development pointing out however accordance principles already laid down these cosmological speculations pretend anything mere appearance
proem proem parmenides journey poet escorted maidens daughters sun made haste escort me having left halls night light ordinary daytime world strange destination outside our human paths
carried whirling chariot attended daughters helios sun man reaches temple sacred unnamed goddess variously identified commentators nature wisdom necessity themis whom rest poem spoken
goddess resides well-known mythological space night day their meeting place
essential character here opposites undivided
must learn things she tells both truth certain human opinions uncertain though cannot rely human opinions represent aspect whole truth
way truth parmenides
detail school athens raphael
section known way truth discusses real contrasts argument section called way opinion discusses illusory
under way truth parmenides stated there two ways inquiry side
other side
latter argument never feasible because there no thing never shall prevail things
there extremely delicate issues here
original greek two ways simply named ὅπως ἐστίν not-is ὡς οὐκ ἐστίν 2
3 2
5 without inserted our english translation
ancient greek like many languages world does require presence subject verb functions grammatically complete sentence
much debate focused subject
simplest explanation why there no subject here parmenides wishes express simple bare fact existence mystical experience without ordinary distinctions just latin pluit greek huei ὕει rains mean rains there no subject these impersonal verbs because express simple fact raining without specifying doing raining
instance hermann fränkel's thesis
many scholars still reject explanation produced complex metaphysical explanations
since existence immediately intuited fact non-existence wrong path because thing cannot disappear just something cannot originate nothing
such mystical experience unio mystica however distinction subject object disappears along distinctions objects addition fact nothing cannot cannot object thought either thinking thought same you will find thinking apart relation uttered
34–36 aware same
3 necessary speak think being nothing
1–2 helplessness guides wandering thought their breasts carried along deaf blind alike dazed beasts without judgment convinced same same road things backward-turning
5–9 thus concluded come being because nothing comes nothing
existence necessarily eternal
truly [x] [x] never becoming [x] becoming [x] never nothing not-[x] will never actually
parmenides struggling formulate laws conservation mass conservation energy struggling metaphysics change still relevant philosophical topic today
moreover argued movement impossible because requires moving void parmenides identified void nothing therefore definition does exist
does exist parmenidean timeless uniform unchanging how perish? how come be? came being nor ever going
thus coming being extinguished destruction unknown
20–22 nor [it] once nor will [it] since [it] now together / continuous coming-to-be will you seek? / way whence [it] grow? neither what-is-not shall allow / you say think thought / [it]
need impelled grow / later sooner began nothing? thus [it] must either completely
5–11 [what exists] now once continuous
nor divisible since alike nor there any less place might prevent holding together full
22–24 me / am begin shall return there again
5 perception vs
logos parmenides claimed there no truth opinions mortals
genesis-and-destruction parmenides emphasizes false opinion because means completely once
exists no way exist
view exists never predominate
you must debar your thought way search nor let ordinary experience variety force you along way namely allowing eye sightless ear full sound tongue rule you must judge means reason logos much-contested proof expounded me
2 way opinion doxa after exposition arche ἀρχή
origin necessary part reality understood through reason logos [it] next section way appearance/opinion/seeming parmenides proceeds explain structure becoming cosmos illusion course comes origin
structure cosmos fundamental binary principle governs manifestations particulars aether fire flame
56 gentle mild soft thin clear self-identical other ignorant night body thick heavy
mortals lay down decided well name two forms
flaming light obscure darkness night out necessary make led astray
53–4 structure cosmos then generated recollected aetius ii 7 parmenides says there circular bands wound round upon other made rare other dense others these mixed light darkness
surrounds them solid like wall
beneath fiery band very middle them solid around again fiery band
most central mixed bands them origin cause motion becoming also calls steering goddess keyholder justice necessity
air separated off earth vapourized violent condensation sun circle milky way exhalations fire
moon mixture both earth fire
aether lies around above else beneath ranged fiery part call heaven beneath regions around earth
interpretations parmenides traditional interpretation parmenides' work argued every-day perception reality physical world described doxa mistaken reality world 'one being' described aletheia unchanging ungenerated indestructible whole
under way opinion parmenides set out contrasting conventional view world thereby becoming early exponent duality appearance reality
pupils phenomena movement change simply appearances changeless eternal reality
interpretation settle because various wrong translations fragments
example clear parmenides refuted call perception
verb noein used frequently parmenides better translated 'to aware of' 'to think'
furthermore hard believe 'being' within our heads according parmenides
parmenides' philosophy presented form poetry
philosophy argued says given goddess though mythological details parmenides' poem bear any close correspondence anything known traditional greek mythology welcome youth come attended immortal charioteers mares bear you your journey our dwelling
no evil fate set you travel road far beaten paths men right justice
meet you learn things — both unshakable heart well-rounded truth opinions mortals there true belief

aristotle himself reasoned opposition atomism complete vacuum motion encounter no resistance no say why thing once set motion should stop anywhere why should stop here rather here? thing will either rest must moved ad infinitum unless something powerful get way
