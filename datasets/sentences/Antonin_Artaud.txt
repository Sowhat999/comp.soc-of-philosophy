apprenticeship charles dullin arguably artaud’s most significant influences shaping radical ideas theater charles dullin
dullin cohort collaborator celebrated french “teacher-directors” jacques copeau andré antoine firmin gémier founded july 1921 referred “laboratory theater” named “théâtre de l'atelier” located néronville france
dullin’s goal created theater trained aspiring actors create “complete actor” “to form actors general culture often lack inculcate them very beginning solid principles actors’ techniques good diction physical training expand their means expression include dance pantomime word form complete actor
artaud taken apprentice dullin 1921 under whom arduously trained eighteen months ten twelve hours day particular emphasis mime gymnastics improvisation voice production various exercises intended heighten one’s sensory perception
making contact one’s surroundings actor get tune “la voix du monde” voice world making way “voix de soi-même” voice oneself order able get actor tune true voice express himself stage
perhaps most evident influence dullin artaud’s 1935 stage production percy shelley’s “the cenci” improvisational exercises related five human senses intended dullin preparation stage
seminars dullin strongly emphasized actors must “see before describing hear before answering…and feel before trying express himself” often using bells sound footsteps masks preparation
actors encouraged forget weight their bodies while using them their faces express themselves often wearing full half mask
internalization process interested artaud most often focusing man’s struggle against elemental forces significant theme “theater cruelty” 1935 staging “the cenci”
dullin recorded exercise gave artaud mime struggle against currents river
artaud quoted saying dullin “hearing dullin teach feel i’m rediscovering ancient secrets whole forgotten mystique production”
artaud’s “theater cruelty” warned against dangers psychology theater strove create theater mise-en-scène everything present staging production understood codified stage language minimal emphasis spoken language
voiced concerns dangers relating “psychological equilibrium” present dullin’s vocal improvisation exercises “these exercises improvisation reveal sharpen true personality
intonation found within oneself pushed out burning power feeling achieved through imitation”
1935 production “the cenci” these raw elemental forces wishes audience feel character’s anguish artaud focused
drama written percy shelley contained themes abuse incest violence murder betrayal
artaud’s stage directions described opening scene “suggestive extreme atmospheric turbulence wind-blown drapes waves suddenly amplified sound crowds figures engaged ‘furious orgy’” accompanied “a chorus church bells” well presence numerous large mannequins
scene often referred “the banquet scene” dullin’s influence artaud very clear both sounds bells sounds amplified footsteps present along strongly emphasized theme elemental forces
while percy shelley’s version “the cenci” conveyed motivations anguish beatrice cenci’s daughter her father through monologues artaud much concerned conveying menacing nature cenci’s presence reverberations their incest relationship though physical discordance invisible “force-field” surrounded them
while artaud implemented much learned apprenticeship charles dullin two butted heads towards end artaud’s apprenticeship citing differences their goals theater
lugné poe influential french theater director symbolist movement described artaud “a painter lost midst actors”
artaud’s strong interest oriental theater specifically balinese chinese part shared mentor dullin dullin unlike artaud think western theater should adopting oriental language style
quoted saying artaud’s influences oriental theater “to want impose our western theater rules theatre long tradition own symbolic language great mistake
artaud’s wishes western theatre much resembling oriental theatre major source conflict two french actors/directors
artaud’s implementation dullin’s sensory awareness exercises stage production clearly observable “the cenci” jane goodall writes performance “the predominance action over reflection accelerates development events…the monologues…are cut favor sudden jarring transitions…so spasmodic effect created
extreme fluctuations pace pitch tone heighten sensory awareness intensify…the here now performance” -goodall jane artaud’s revision shelley’s cenci’ text double comparative drama vol

artaud’s implementation dullins preparation techniques intended stage combination physical symbolic language specific oriental theater artaud’s strongest influences both shaping “the theater cruelty” staging “the cenci”
theatre cruelty artaud believed theatre should force liberation human subconscious revelation man himself
called communion actor audience magic exorcism gestures sounds unusual scenery lighting combine form language superior words used subvert thought logic shock spectator seeing baseness world
book theatre double contained first second manifesto theatre cruelty artaud expressed admiration eastern forms theatre particularly balinese
admired eastern theatre because codified highly ritualized precise physicality balinese dance performance advocated called theatre cruelty
point stated cruelty meant exclusively sadism causing pain just often violent physical determination shatter false reality
believed text tyrant over meaning advocated instead theatre made up unique language halfway thought gesture
artaud described spiritual physical terms believed theatre physical expression space
theatre cruelty created order restore theatre passionate convulsive conception life sense violent rigour extreme condensation scenic elements cruelty based must understood
cruelty will bloody necessary systematically thus identified kind severe moral purity afraid pay life price must paid
antonin artaud theatre cruelty theory modern stage ed
eric bentley penguin 1968 p
66 evidently artaud's various uses term cruelty must examined fully understand ideas
lee jamieson identified four ways artaud used term cruelty
first employed metaphorically describe essence human existence
artaud believed theatre should reflect nihilistic view universe creating uncanny connection own thinking nietzsche's[citation needed] [nietzsche's] definition cruelty informs artaud's own declaring art embodies intensifies underlying brutalities life recreate thrill experience
although artaud formally cite nietzsche [their writing] contains familiar persuasive authority similar exuberant phraseology motifs extremis
lee jamieson antonin artaud theory practice greenwich exchange 2007 p
21-22 artaud's second use term according jamieson form discipline
although artaud wanted reject form incite chaos jamieson p
also promoted strict discipline rigor performance techniques
third use term ‘cruelty theatrical presentation’
theatre cruelty aimed hurl spectator centre action forcing them engage performance instinctive level
artaud cruel yet necessary act upon spectator designed shock them out their complacency artaud sought remove aesthetic distance bringing audience direct contact dangers life
turning theatre place spectator exposed rather protected artaud committing act cruelty upon them
lee jamieson antonin artaud theory practice greenwich exchange 2007 p
23 artaud wanted put audience middle 'spectacle' term play 'engulfed physically affected it'
referred layout being like 'vortex' - constantly shifting shape - 'to trapped powerless'
also placed great emphasis sound rather words dialogue incorporating loud cries screams eerie sounds noises causing audience become uncomfortable
words insufficient medium expression
finally artaud used term describe philosophical views will outlined following section
1989 norwegian actor-turned-director lars øyno made performance elagabal colleagues trondelag teatre trondheim norway
led foundation grusomhetens teater oslo 1992
using artaud's manifestos sources contemporary practice stage made 23 plays theater cruelty form
øyno traveled countries like india russia germany poland uk us etc
resurrection theater cruelty attracted drama festivals different countries
yet grusomhetens teater troupe world dedicated completely artaud's principles theater
reality appeared consensus same consensus audience accepts enter theatre see play time pretend seeing real
artaud saw suffering essential existence thus rejected utopias inevitable dystopia
denounced degradation civilization yearned cosmic purification called ecstatic loss self
hence jane goodall considers artaud modern gnostic while ulli seegers stresses hermetic elements works
very important study artaud work comes jacques derrida
according philosopher theatrical writer actor artaud embodiment both aggressive repairing gesture strikes sounds out harsh dramatic way critical determination well
identifying life art critically focused western cultural social drama point out deny double-dealing western theatrical tradition based worked whirlpool feelings lunatic expressions being subjugated counter-force came act gesture
artaud heavily influenced seeing colonial exposition balinese theatre marseille
read eclectically inspired authors artists such seneca shakespeare poe lautréamont alfred jarry andré masson
influence artaud cited profoundly influential figure history theater avant-garde art literature other disciplines
work proved significant influence theater absurd particularly works jean genet samuel beckett helped inspire movement away dominant role language rationalism contemporary theater
artaud also significant influence philosophers gilles deleuze félix guattari borrowed artaud's phrase body without organs describe their conception virtual dimension body ultimately basic substratum reality their capitalism schizophrenia
poet allen ginsberg claimed introduction artaud specifically done judgement god carl solomon tremendous influence most famous poem howl
theatrical practitioner peter brook took inspiration artaud's theatre cruelty series workshops led up royal shakespeare company production marat/sade 1964 performed new york paris well london
living theatre also heavily influenced artaud much english-language experimental theatre performance art karen finley spalding gray liz le compte richard foreman charles marowitz sam shepard joseph chaikin named artaud their influences
winter 1968 williams college offered dedicated intersession class artaudian theater resulting week-long festival cruelty under direction keith fowler
festival included productions jet blood writing pig shit several original ritualized performances based texas tower killings another created ensemble catharsis called resurrection pig man
