theology method correlation key understanding tillich’s theology calls method correlation
approach correlates insights christian revelation issues raised existential psychological philosophical analysis
tillich states introduction systematic theology theology formulates questions implied human existence theology formulates answers implied divine self-manifestation under guidance questions implied human existence
circle drives man point question answer separated
point however moment time
christian message provides answers questions implied human existence
these answers contained revelatory events christianity based taken systematic theology sources through medium under norm
their content cannot derived questions come analysis human existence
‘spoken’ human existence beyond sense
otherwise answers question human existence itself
tillich existential questions human existence associated field philosophy specifically ontology study being
because according tillich lifelong pursuit philosophy reveals central question every philosophical inquiry comes back question being means exist finite human being
correlated these questions theological answers themselves derived christian revelation
task philosopher primarily involves developing questions whereas task theologian primarily involves developing answers these questions
however should remembered two tasks overlap include another theologian must somewhat philosopher vice versa tillich’s notion faith “ultimate concern” necessitates theological answer correlated compatible response general ontological question must developed independently answers
thus side correlation lies ontological analysis human situation whereas other presentation christian message response existential dilemma
tillich no formulation question contradict theological answer
because christian message claims priori logos “who became flesh” also universal logos greeks
addition intimate relationship philosophy theology another important aspect method correlation tillich’s distinction form content theological answers
while nature revelation determines actual content theological answers character questions determines form these answers
because tillich theology must answering theology apologetic theology
god called “ground being” because god answer ontological threat non-being characterization theological answer philosophical terms means answer conditioned insofar form considered question
throughout systematic theology tillich careful maintain distinction form content without allowing inadvertently conditioned other
many criticisms tillich’s methodology revolve around issue whether integrity christian message really maintained form conditioned philosophy
theological answer also determined sources theology our experience norm theology
though form theological answers determined character question these answers “are contained revelatory events christianity based” also “taken systematic theology sources through medium under norm
there three main sources systematic theology bible church history history religion culture
experience source medium through sources speak
norm theology both sources experience judged regard content christian faith
thus following elements method structure systematic theology sources theology bible church history history religion culture medium sources collective experience church norm theology determines use sources content biblical message itself example justification through faith new being jesus christ protestant principle criterion cross mc kelway explains sources theology contribute formation norm then becomes criterion through sources experience judged
relationship circular present situation conditions norm interaction church biblical message
norm then subject change tillich insists basic content remains same biblical message
tempting conflate revelation norm must keep mind revelation whether original dependent element structure systematic theology per se event
tillich present-day norm “new being jesus christ our ultimate concern”
because present question estrangement overcoming estrangement tillich calls “new being”
since christianity answers question estrangement “jesus christ” norm tells us find new being jesus christ
there also question validity method correlation
certainly reject method grounds there no priori reason adoption
tillich claims method any theology system interdependent
absolute methodological approach cannot adopted because method continually being determined system objects theology
use being systematic theology tillich used concept being systematic theology
there three roles …[the concept being] appears present system three places doctrine god god called being being ground power being doctrine man distinction carried through man's essential existential being finally doctrine christ called manifestation new being actualization work divine spirit
— tillich …it expression experience being over against non-being
therefore described power being resists non-being
reason medieval philosophers called being basic transcendentale beyond universal particular… same word emptiest concepts taken abstraction becomes most meaningful concepts understood power being everything being
— tillich life spirit part four tillich's systematic theology
part tillich talks life divine spirit
life remains ambiguous long there life
question implied ambiguities life derives new question namely direction life moves
question history
systematically speaking history characterized direction toward future dynamic quality life
therefore riddle history part problem life
— tillich systematic theology vol
2 p
4 absolute faith tillich stated courage take meaninglessness oneself presupposes relation ground being absolute faith
absolute faith transcend theistic idea god three elements
… first element experience power being present even face most radical manifestation non being
says experience vitality resists despair must add vitality man proportional intentionality
vitality stand abyss meaninglessness aware hidden meaning within destruction meaning
— tillich courage p
177 second element absolute faith dependence experience nonbeing experience being dependence experience meaninglessness experience meaning
even state despair enough being make despair possible
— tillich courage p
177 there third element absolute faith acceptance being accepted
course state despair there nobody nothing accepts
there power acceptance itself experienced
meaninglessness long experienced includes experience power acceptance
accept power acceptance consciously religious answer absolute faith faith deprived doubt any concrete content nevertheless faith source most paradoxical manifestation courage
— tillich courage p
177 faith ultimate concern according stanford encyclopedia philosophy tillich believes essence religious attitudes calls ultimate concern
separate profane ordinary realities object concern understood sacred numinous holy
perception reality felt overwhelming valuable else seems insignificant reason requires total surrender
1957 tillich defined conception faith explicitly work dynamics faith
… man like every living being concerned many things above those condition very existence
[a situation concern] claims ultimacy demands total surrender accepts claim
demands other concerns
— tillich dynamics faith p
1-2 tillich further refined conception faith stating … faith ultimate concern act total personality
most centered act human mind
participates dynamics personal life
— tillich dynamics faith p
5 arguably central component tillich's concept faith notion faith ecstatic
say … transcends both drives nonrational unconsciousness structures rational conscious
ecstatic character faith does exclude rational character although identical includes nonrational strivings without being identical them
'ecstasy' means 'standing outside oneself' - without ceasing oneself - elements united personal center
— tillich dynamics faith p
8-9 short tillich faith does stand opposed rational nonrational elements reason emotion respectively philosophers maintain
rather transcends them ecstatic passion ultimate
should also noted tillich does exclude atheists exposition faith
everyone ultimate concern concern act faith even act faith includes denial god
there ultimate concern god denied name god god above god bust tillich james rosati new harmony indiana throughout most works paul tillich provides apologetic alternative ontological view god
traditional medieval philosophical theology work figures such st
anselm duns scotus william ockham tended understand god highest existing being[citation needed] predicates such omnipotence omniscience omnipresence goodness righteousness holiness etc
may ascribed
arguments against existence god presuppose such understanding god
tillich critical mode discourse refers theological theism argues god being [das seiende] even highest being god cannot properly called source being question course then posed why god exists created god god's beginning
put issue traditional language god 'being' [das seiende] then god creature even highest thus cannot creator
rather god must understood ground being-itself
problem persists same way attempting determine whether god eternal essence existing being neither adequate traditional theology well aware
god understood way becomes clear impossible argue existence god since god beyond distinction essence existence also foolish cannot deny there being thus there power being
question then becomes whether way personal language god humanity's relationship god appropriate
distinction theological theism tillich refers another kind theism divine-human encounter
such theism encounter wholly other das ganz andere work karl barth rudolf otto implies personalism regard god's self-revelation
tillich quite clear both appropriate necessary basis personalism biblical religion altogether concept word god become falsified theologian tries turn such encounters god wholly other understanding god being
other words god both personal transpersonal
tillich's ontological view god precedent christian theology
many theologians especially those hellenistic patristic period christianity's history corresponds church fathers understood god unoriginate source agennetos being
view espoused particular origen number early theologians whose thought influenced tillich
their views turn pre-christian precedents middle platonism
tillich further argues theological theism logically problematic unable speak situation radical doubt despair meaning life
issue primary concern modern age opposed anxiety fate guilt death condemnation
because state finitude entails necessity anxiety our finitude human beings our being mixture being nonbeing ultimate basis anxiety
god ground being itself then god cannot provide answer question finitude god also finite sense
term god above god then means indicate god appears ground being itself god theological theism disappeared anxiety doubt
while hand god goes beyond god theism usually defined finds expression many religious symbols christian faith particularly crucified christ
possibility thus exists says tillich religious symbols may recovered otherwise rendered ineffective contemporary society
tillich argues god theological theism root much revolt against theism religious faith modern period
tillich states sympathetically god theological theism deprives me my subjectivity because all-powerful all-knowing
revolt make object revolt fails becomes desperate
god appears invincible tyrant being contrast whom other beings without freedom subjectivity
equated recent tyrants help terror try transform everything mere object thing among things cog machine control
becomes model everything against existentialism revolted
god nietzsche killed because nobody tolerate being made mere object absolute knowledge absolute control
deepest root atheism
atheism justified reaction against theological theism disturbing implications
another reason tillich criticized theological theism because placed god subject-object dichotomy
basic distinction made epistemology branch philosophy deals human knowledge how possible limits
epistemologically god cannot made object object knowing subject
tillich deals question under rubric relationality god
question whether there external relations god creature
traditionally christian theology understood doctrine creation mean precisely external relationality god creator creature separate identical realities
tillich reminds us point found luther there no place man withdraw divine thou because includes ego nearer ego ego itself
tillich goes further say desire draw god subject-object dichotomy insult divine holiness
similarly god made subject rather object knowledge ultimate subject then rest existing entities then become subjected absolute knowledge scrutiny god human being reified made mere object
deprive person her own subjectivity creativity
according tillich theological theism provoked rebellions found atheism existentialism although other social factors such industrial revolution also contributed reification human being
modern man no longer tolerate idea being object completely subjected absolute knowledge god
tillich argued mentioned theological theism bad theology
god theological theism being besides others such part whole reality
certainly considered most important part part therefore subjected structure whole
supposed beyond ontological elements categories constitute reality
every statement subjects them
seen self world ego relates thought cause separated effect having definite space endless time
being being-itself alternatively tillich presents above-mentioned ontological view god being-itself ground being power being occasionally abyss god's abysmal being
makes tillich's ontological view god different theological theism transcends being foundation ultimate reality precedes beings
just being heidegger ontologically prior conception tillich views god beyond being-itself manifested structure beings
god supernatural entity among other entities
instead god ground upon beings exist
cannot perceive god object related subject because god precedes subject-object dichotomy
thus tillich dismisses literalistic biblicism
instead rejecting notion personal god however tillich sees symbol points directly ground being
since ground being ontologically precedes reason cannot comprehended since comprehension presupposes subject-object dichotomy
tillich disagreed any literal philosophical religious statements made god
such literal statements attempt define god lead anthropomorphism also philosophical mistake immanuel kant warned against setting limits against transcendent inevitably leads contradictions
any statements god simply symbolic these symbols sacred sense function participate point ground being
tillich insists anyone participates these symbols empowered power being overcomes conquers nonbeing meaninglessness
tillich also further elaborated thesis god above god theism systematic theology
… god above god theism misunderstood dogmatic statement pantheistic mystical character
first dogmatic apologetic statement
takes seriously radical doubt experienced many people
gives courage self-affirmation even extreme state radical doubt
— tillich systematic theology vol
2 p
12 … such state god both religious theological language disappears
something remains namely seriousness doubt meaning within meaninglessness affirmed
source affirmation meaning within meaninglessness certitude within doubt god traditional theism god above god power being works through those no name even name god
— tillich systematic theology vol
2 p
12 …this answer those ask message nothingness their situation end their courage
such extreme point space live
dialectics extreme situation criterion truth basis whole structure truth built

12 tillich's ontology courage paul tillich's work courage defines courage self-affirmation one’s being spite threat nonbeing
relates courage anxiety anxiety being threat non-being courage use combat threat
tillich outlines three types anxiety thus three ways display courage
anxiety fate death
anxiety fate death most basic universal form anxiety tillich
relates quite simply recognition our mortality
troubles us humans
become anxious unsure whether our actions create causal damnation leads very real unavoidable death 42-44
“nonbeing threatens man’s ontic self-affirmation relatively terms fate absolutely terms death” 41
display courage cease rely others tell us will come us will happen die etc
begin seeking those answers out ourselves
called “courage confidence” 162-63
2 anxiety guilt condemnation
anxiety afflicts our moral self-affirmation
humans responsible our moral being asked our judge whomever may made ourselves must answer
anxiety produced realize our being unsatisfactory
“it [nonbeing] threatens man’s moral self-affirmation relatively terms guilt absolutely terms condemnation” 41
display courage first identify our sin despair whatever causing us guilt afflicting condemnation
then rely idea accepted regardless
“the courage courage accept oneself accepted spite being unacceptable” 164
3 anxiety meaningless emptiness
anxiety meaninglessness emptiness attacks our being whole
worry loss ultimate concern goal
anxiety also brought loss spirituality
beings feel threat non-being feel no place purpose world
“it [nonbeing] threatens man’s spiritual self-affirmation relatively terms emptiness absolutely terms meaninglessness” 41
display courage facing anxiety displaying true faith again self-affirming oneself
draw “power being” god tillich use faith turn affirm ourselves negate non-being
find our meaning purpose through “power being” 172-73
tillich writes ultimate source courage god above god transcends theistic idea god content absolute faith defined accepting acceptance without somebody something accepts 185
popular works two tillich's works courage 1952 dynamics faith 1957 read widely including people normally read religious books
courage lists three basic anxieties anxiety our biological finitude
arising knowledge will eventually die anxiety our moral finitude linked guilt anxiety our existential finitude sense aimlessness life
tillich related these three different historical eras early centuries christian era reformation 20 th century
tillich's popular works influenced psychology well theology having influence rollo may whose courage create inspired courage
reception today tillich’s most observable legacy may well spiritually-oriented public intellectual teacher broad continuing range influence
tillich‘s chapel sermons especially union enthusiastically received tillich known faculty member day union willing attend revivals billy graham
tillich's students commented tillich's approachability lecturer need interaction audience
tillich university professor harvard chosen keynote speaker among auspicious gathering many appeared cover time magazine during first four decades
tillich along student psychologist rollo may early leader esalen institute

criticism martin buber criticized tillich's transtheistic position reduction god impersonal necessary being thomas aquinas
tillich criticized barthian wing protestantism alleged correlation theory's tendency reduce god relationship man anthropocentric terms
tillich counters barth's approach theology denies possibility understanding god's relation man any other way heteronomously extrinsically
defenders tillich claim critics misunderstand distinction tillich makes god's essence unconditional das unbedingte ground being unknowable how god reveals himself mankind existence
tillich establishes distinction first chapter systematic theology volume though god abysmal nature [footnote 'calvin essence' no way dependent man god self manifestation man dependent way man receives manifestation
conservative strains evangelical christianity believe tillich's thought too unorthodox qualify christianity rather form pantheism atheism
evangelical dictionary theology states best tillich pantheist thought borders atheism
