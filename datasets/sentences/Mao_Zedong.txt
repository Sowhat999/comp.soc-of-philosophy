however because there policy select least landlord usually several virtually every village public execution number deaths range 2 million 5 million
addition least
5 million people perhaps many 4 6 million sent reform through labour camps many perished
mao played personal role organizing mass repressions established system execution quotas often exceeded
defended these killings necessary securing power
starting 1951 mao initiated two successive movements effort rid urban areas corruption targeting wealthy capitalists political opponents known three-anti/five-anti campaigns
whereas three-anti campaign focused purge government industrial party officials five-anti campaign set sights slightly broader targeting capitalist elements general
workers denounced their bosses spouses turned their spouses children informed their parents victims often humiliated struggle sessions method designed intimidate terrify people maximum
mao insisted minor offenders criticised reformed sent labour camps while worst among them should shot
these campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives vast majority via suicide
shanghai suicide jumping tall buildings became commonplace residents avoided walking pavement near skyscrapers fear suicides might land them
biographers pointed out driving those perceived enemies suicide common tactic during mao-era
example biography mao philip short notes yan'an rectification movement mao gave explicit instructions no cadre killed practice allowed security chief kang sheng drive opponents suicide pattern repeated throughout leadership people's republic
mao joseph stalin's 70 th birthday celebration moscow december 1949 following consolidation power mao launched first five-year plan 1953–58
plan aimed end chinese dependence upon agriculture order become world power
soviet union's assistance new industrial plants built agricultural production eventually fell point industry beginning produce enough capital china no longer needed ussr's support
success first-five year plan encourage mao instigate second five-year plan 1958
mao also launched phase rapid collectivization
cpc introduced price controls well chinese character simplification aimed increasing literacy
large-scale industrialization projects also undertaken
programs pursued during time include hundred flowers campaign mao indicated supposed willingness consider different opinions how china should governed
given freedom express themselves liberal intellectual chinese began opposing communist party questioning leadership
initially tolerated encouraged
after few months mao's government reversed policy persecuted those totalling perhaps 500000[citation needed] criticised well those merely alleged criticised party called anti-rightist movement
authors such jung chang alleged hundred flowers campaign merely ruse root out dangerous thinking
li zhisui mao's physician suggested mao initially seen policy way weakening those within party opposed surprised extent criticism fact began directed own leadership

hundred flowers movement led condemnation silencing death many citizens also linked mao's anti-rightist movement death tolls possibly millions
[citation needed] great leap forward mao nikita khrushchev ho chi minh during state dinner beijing 1959 january 1958 mao launched second five-year plan known great leap forward plan intended alternative model economic growth soviet model focusing heavy industry advocated others party
under economic program relatively small agricultural collectives formed date rapidly merged far larger people's communes many peasants ordered work massive infrastructure projects production iron steel
private food production banned livestock farm implements brought under collective ownership
under great leap forward mao other party leaders ordered implementation variety unproven unscientific new agricultural techniques new communes
combined diversion labour steel production infrastructure projects these projects combined cyclical natural disasters led approximately 15% drop grain production 1959 followed further 10% decline 1960 no recovery 1961
effort win favour their superiors avoid being purged each layer party hierarchy exaggerated amount grain produced under them
based upon fabricated success party cadres ordered requisition disproportionately high amount true harvest state use primarily cities urban areas also export
net result compounded areas drought others floods left rural peasants little food themselves many millions starved death largest famine known great chinese famine
famine direct cause death 30 million chinese peasants 1959 1962
further many children became emaciated malnourished during years hardship struggle survival died shortly after great leap forward came end 1962
extent mao's knowledge severity situation disputed
mao's physician believed may unaware extent famine partly due reluctance criticise policies decisions willingness staff exaggerate outright fake reports regarding food production
upon learning extent starvation mao vowed stop eating meat action followed staff
beginning commune members able eat free commune canteens
changed food production slowed halt
hong kong-based historian frank dikötter challenged notion mao know famine throughout country until too late idea state mistakenly took too much grain countryside because assumed harvest much larger largely myth—at most partially true autumn 1958
most cases party knew very well starving own people death
secret meeting jinjiang hotel shanghai dated march 25 1959 mao specifically ordered party procure up third grain much ever case
meeting announced distribute resources evenly will ruin great leap forward
there enough eat people starve death
better let half people die other half eat their fill
professor emeritus thomas p
bernstein columbia university offered view mao's statement starvation march 25 1959 meeting scholars believe shows mao’s readiness accept mass death immense scale
my own view instance mao’s use hyperbole another being casual acceptance death half population during nuclear war
other contexts mao fact accept mass death
zhou’s chronology shows october 1958 mao expressed real concern 40000 people yunnan starved death p
shortly after march 25 meeting worried 25
2 million people risk starvation
late summer mao essentially forgot issue until noted xinyang incident came light october 1960
article mao zedong famine 1959–1960 study wilfulness published 2006 china quarterly professor thomas p
bernstein also discussed mao's change attitudes during different phases great leap forward late autumn 1958 mao zedong strongly condemned widespread practices great leap forward glf such subjecting peasants exhausting labour without adequate food rest resulted epidemics starvation deaths
time mao explicitly recognized anti-rightist pressures officialdom major cause production expense livelihood
while willing acknowledge abandonment glf solve these problems strongly demand addressed
after july 1959 clash lushan peng dehuai mao revived glf context new extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign relentlessly promoted spring 1960 together radical policies previously condemned
until spring 1960 mao again express concern abnormal deaths other abuses failed apply pressure needed stop them
given already learned costs peasants glf extremism chairman should known revival glf radicalism exact similar even bigger price
instead wilfully ignored lessons first radical phase sake achieving extreme ideological developmental goals
hungry ghosts mao's secret famine jasper becker notes mao dismissive reports received food shortages countryside refused change course believing peasants lying rightists kulaks hoarding grain
refused open state granaries instead launched series anti-grain concealment drives resulted numerous purges suicides
other violent campaigns followed party leaders went village village search hidden food reserves grain mao issued quotas pigs chickens ducks eggs
many peasants accused hiding food tortured beaten death
whatever case great leap forward caused mao lose esteem among many top party cadres eventually forced abandon policy 1962 while losing political power moderate leaders perhaps most notably liu shaoqi deng xiaoping process
however mao supported national propaganda claimed partly blame famine china
result able remain chairman communist party presidency transferred liu shaoqi
great leap forward tragedy vast majority chinese
although steel quotas officially reached almost supposed steel made countryside iron made assorted scrap metal home-made furnaces no reliable source fuel such coal
meant proper smelting conditions achieved
according zhang rongmei geometry teacher rural shanghai during great leap forward took furniture pots pans our house our neighbours likewise
put everything big fire melted down metal
worst famine steered towards enemies state
jasper becker explains most vulnerable section china's population around five per cent those whom mao called 'enemies people'
anyone previous campaigns repression labeled 'black element' given lowest priority allocation food
landlords rich peasants former members nationalist regime religious leaders rightists counter-revolutionaries families such individuals died greatest numbers
large communist party conference beijing january 1962 called conference seven thousand state chairman liu shaoqi denounced great leap forward responsible widespread famine
overwhelming majority delegates expressed agreement defense minister lin biao staunchly defended mao
brief period liberalization followed while mao lin plotted comeback
liu shaoqi deng xiaoping rescued economy disbanding people's communes introducing elements private control peasant smallholdings importing grain canada australia mitigate worst effects famine

consequences lushan conference july/august 1959 several ministers expressed concern great leap forward proved successful planned
most direct these minister defence korean war veteran general peng dehuai
following peng's criticism great leap forward mao orchestrated purge peng supporters stifling criticism great leap policies
senior officials reported truth famine mao branded right opportunists
campaign against right-wing opportunism launched resulted party members ordinary peasants being sent prison labor camps many subsequently die famine
years later cpc conclude many six million people wrongly punished campaign
number deaths starvation during great leap forward deeply controversial
until mid-1980 s official census figures finally published chinese government little known scale disaster chinese countryside handful western observers allowed access during time restricted model villages deceived believing great leap forward great success
there also assumption flow individual reports starvation reaching west primarily through hong kong taiwan must localised exaggerated china continuing claim record harvests net exporter grain through period
because mao wanted pay back early soviets debts totalling
973 billion yuan 1960 1962 exports increased 50% fellow communist regimes north korea north vietnam albania provided grain free charge
censuses carried out china 1953 1964 1982
first attempt analyse data estimate number famine deaths carried out american demographer dr
judith banister published 1984
given lengthy gaps censuses doubts over reliability data accurate figure difficult ascertain
nevertheless banister concluded official data implied around 15 million excess deaths incurred china during 1958–61 based her modelling chinese demographics during period taking account assumed under-reporting during famine years figure around 30 million
official statistic 20 million deaths given hu yaobang
yang jisheng former xinhua news agency reporter privileged access connections available no other scholars estimates death toll 36 million

alas say? —chen yun leading communist party official under mao deng xiaoping
mao remains controversial figure there little agreement over legacy both china abroad
supporters generally credit praise having unified china ending previous decades civil war
also credited having improved status women china improving literacy education
policies caused deaths tens millions people china during 27-year reign any other twentieth century leader number people died under regime range 40 million many 70 million
however supporters point out spite life expectancy improved during reign
supporters claim rapidly industrialised china however others claimed policies such great leap forward great proletarian cultural revolution impediments industrialisation modernisation
supporters claim policies laid groundwork china's later rise become economic superpower while others claim policies delayed economic development china's economy underwent rapid growth after mao's policies widely abandoned
mao's revolutionary tactics continue used insurgents political ideology continues embraced many communist organizations around world
mainland china mao still revered many members supporters communist party respected majority general population founding father modern china credited giving chinese people dignity self-respect
mobo gao 2008 book battle china's past mao cultural revolution credits mao raising average life expectancy 35 1949 63 1975 bringing unity stability country plagued civil wars foreign invasions laying foundation china become equal great global powers
gao also lauds mao carrying out massive land reform promoting status women improving popular literacy positively transforming chinese society beyond recognition
however mao many chinese critics both those live inside outside china
opposition mao subject restriction censorship mainland china especially strong elsewhere often reviled brutish ideologue
west name generally associated tyranny economic theories widely discredited—though political activists remains symbol against capitalism imperialism western influence
even china key pillars economic theory largely dismantled market reformers like deng xiaoping zhao ziyang succeeded leaders communist party
statue young mao changsha capital hunan though chinese communist party mao led power rejected practice economic fundamentals much mao's ideology retains itself many powers established under mao's reign controls chinese army police courts media does permit multi-party elections national local level except hong kong

result such tactics critics pointed out people's republic china under mao exhibited oppressive tendencies discernible major absolutist regimes twentieth century
there obvious parallels mao's china nazi germany soviet russia
each these regimes witnessed deliberately ordered mass 'cleansing' extermination
others such philip short reject such comparisons mao life arguing whereas deaths caused nazi germany soviet russia largely systematic deliberate overwhelming majority deaths under mao unintended consequences famine
