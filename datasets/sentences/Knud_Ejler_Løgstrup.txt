work ethical demand løgstrup's 1956 book ethical demand den etiske fordring develops account demand løgstrup takes built our experience life other people trust our own making given
our life constituted cannot lived except person lays herself open another person puts herself person’s hands either showing claiming trust
our very attitude another help shape person’s world
our attitude other person help determine scope hue her world make large small bright drab rich dull threatening secure
help shape her world theories views our very attitude towards her
herein lies unarticulated might say anonymous demand take care life trust placed our hands
because position influence degree how well another person’s life goes them even very minor ways find ourselves position power over them “because power involved every human relationship advance compelled decide whether use our power over other serving serving ourselves
løgstrup demand built our dealings others act one-sidedly other’s sake our own “everything individual opportunity say relation other person done own sake sake her whose life hand
demand ultimately turns out unfulfillable løgstrup sense “what demanded demand should necessary
other words any given situation ethical demand becomes salient agent already failed live up agent should simply acted spontaneously selfless concern other
løgstrup takes ethical demand prior social norms moral principles
such principles norms cannot simply ignored may make us act done realized ethical demand reason morally useful
ultimately substitute genuinely realizing ethical constitutive doing mainstream moral philosophy assumes
ethical demand contains analyses concrete phenomena such trust løgstrup takes fundamental moral life
trust løgstrup conceptually prior todistrust basic attitude built discourse trust sincerity interlocutor hence gradually learn distrust others
subsequent work decades following ethical demand løgstrup continued develop 'ontological ethics' alternative standard deontic utilitarian virtue ethics frameworks
continued insist while virtues character traitsand duties usefully provide 'substitute' motives moral action these secondary ethical demand requires spontaneous loving response other
systems norms come play moral action spontaneous response already failed
consequently løgstrup critical emphasis rule-following universal principles most anglophone moral theory
example løgstrup mentions stephen toulmin's example everyday situation 'i borrowed book john question now why should give back today promised him?' according toulmin question will push us reflect principles ever-higher levels abstraction should keep my promises should never lie etc
løgstrup increasing universalisation leads 'moralism' abstracts concrete situation needs actual person
instead moral reflection should remain level given situation 'because my friend needs book back!' sovereign expressions life early criticisms ethical demand endorsed form naturalist fallacy inferred normative responsibility act sake other descriptive fact other our power
partly response objection løgstrup go develop account sovereign expressions life suværene livsytringerwhich first appear 1968 book opgør med kierkegaard 'settling accounts kierkegaard' 'confronting kierkegaard' further developed norm og spontaneitet “norm spontaneity” 1972
category includes phenomena such trust openness speech mercy
these phenomena present themselves us according løgstrup intrinsically good rather neutral phenomena need evaluate against external standard
emanate agent life itself demand submission rather application principles cultivation virtues
