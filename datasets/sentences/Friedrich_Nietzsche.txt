philosophy friedrich nietzsche 1869
main article philosophy friedrich nietzsche because nietzsche's evocative style provocative ideas philosophy generates passionate reactions
works remain controversial due varying interpretations misinterpretations work
western philosophy tradition nietzsche's writings described unique case free revolutionary thought revolutionary structure problems although tied any revolutionary project
apollonian dionysian main article apollonian dionysian apollonian dionysian two-fold philosophical concept based certain features ancient greek mythology apollo dionysus
while concept famously related birth tragedy poet hölderlin spoke them before winckelmann talked bacchus
year before publication birth tragedy nietzsche fragment titled music words
asserted schopenhauerian judgment music primary expression essence everything
secondarily derivative lyrical poetry drama represent mere phenomenal appearances objects
way tragedy born music
nietzsche found classical athenian tragedy art form transcended pessimism found so-called wisdom silenus
greek spectators looking abyss human suffering depicted characters stage passionately joyously affirmed life finding worth living
main theme birth tragedy fusion dionysian apollonian kunsttrieben artistic impulses forms dramatic arts tragedies
goes argue fusion achieved since ancient greek tragedians
apollo represents harmony progress clarity logic whereas dionysus represents disorder intoxication emotion ecstasy
nietzsche used these two forces because world mind order side passion chaos other formed principles fundamental greek culture
apollonian side being dreaming state full illusions dionysian being state intoxication representing liberations instinct dissolution boundaries
mold man appears satyr
horror annihilation principle individuality same time someone delights destruction
both these principles meant represent cognitive states appear through art power nature man
relationship apollonian dionysian juxtapositions apparent interplay tragedy tragic hero drama main protagonist struggles make order apollonian sense unjust chaotic dionysian fate though dies unfulfilled end
elaborating conception hamlet intellectual cannot make up mind therefore living antithesis man action nietzsche argues dionysian figure possesses knowledge realize actions cannot change eternal balance things disgusts enough able make any act
hamlet falls under category glimpsed supernatural reality through ghost gained true knowledge knows no action power change
audience such drama tragedy allows them sense underlying essence nietzsche called primordial unity revives dionysian nature
describes primordial unity increase strength experience fullness plenitude bestowed frenzy
frenzy acts intoxication crucial physiological condition enables making any art
stimulated state person's artistic will enhanced state enriches everything out one's own fullness whatever sees whatever wills seen swelled taut strong overloaded strength
man state transforms things until mirror power—until reflections perfection
having transform perfection is—art
nietzsche adamant works aeschylus sophocles represent apex artistic creation true realization tragedy euripides states tragedy begins untergang literally going under downward-way meaning decline deterioration downfall death etc
nietzsche objects euripides' use socratic rationalism morality tragedies claiming infusion ethics reason robs tragedy foundation namely fragile balance dionysian apollonian
socrates emphasized reason such degree diffused value myth suffering human knowledge
plato continued path dialogues modern world eventually inherited reason expense artistic impulses found apollonian dionysus dichotomy
leads conclusion european culture time socrates apollonian thus decadent unhealthy
notes whenever apollonian culture dominates dionysian lacks structure make coherent art dionysian dominates apollonian lacks necessary passion
beautiful middle interplay these two forces brought together art represented real greek tragedy
example impact idea seen book patterns culture anthropologist ruth benedict uses nietzschean opposites apollonian dionysian stimulus her thoughts native american cultures
carl jung written extensively dichotomy psychological types
michel foucault commented book madness civilization should read under sun great nietzschean inquiry
here foucault references nietzsche's description birth death tragedy explanation subsequent tragedy western world refusal tragic refusal sacred
painter mark rothko influenced nietzsche's view tragedy presented birth tragedy
perspectivism main article perspectivism nietzsche claimed death god eventually lead loss any universal perspective things along any coherent sense objective truth
[page needed] nietzsche himself rejected idea objective reality arguing knowledge contingent conditional relative various fluid perspectives interests
leads constant reassessment rules
those philosophy scientific method etc
according circumstances individual perspectives
view acquired name perspectivism
thus spoke zarathustra nietzsche proclaims table values hangs above every great person
points out common among different peoples act esteeming creating values even values different people next
nietzsche asserts made people great content their beliefs act valuing
thus values community strives articulate important collective will see those values come pass
willing essential intrinsic worth goal itself according nietzsche
thousand goals there far says zarathustra there thousand peoples
yoke thousand necks still lacking goal lacking
humanity still no goal
hence title aphorism thousand goals
idea value-system no worthy next although may directly ascribed nietzsche become common premise modern social science

philosopher alasdair mac intyre puts nietzsche high place history philosophy
while criticizing nihilism nietzsche together sign general decay still commends recognizing psychological motives behind kant hume's moral philosophy nietzsche's historic achievement understand clearly any other philosopher
purported appeals objectivity fact expressions subjective will also nature problems posed philosophy
slave revolt morals main article master–slave morality beyond good evil genealogy morality nietzsche's genealogical account development modern moral systems occupies central place
nietzsche fundamental shift took place during human history thinking terms good bad toward good evil
initial form morality set warrior aristocracy other ruling castes ancient civilizations
aristocratic values good bad coincided reflected their relationship lower castes such slaves
nietzsche presents master morality original system morality—perhaps best associated homeric greece
good happy things related happiness wealth strength health power etc
bad like slaves aristocracy ruled over poor weak sick pathetic—an object pity disgust rather hatred
slave morality comes reaction master-morality
here value emerges contrast good evil good being associated other-worldliness charity piety restraint meekness submission evil seen worldly cruel selfish wealthy aggressive
nietzsche sees slave morality pessimistic fearful values them serving ease existence those suffer very same thing
associates slave-morality jewish christian traditions way slave-morality born out ressentiment slaves
nietzsche argued idea equality allowed slaves overcome their own condition without hating themselves
denying inherent inequality people such success strength beauty intelligence slaves acquired method escape namely generating new values basis rejecting something seen perceived source frustration
used overcome slave's own sense inferiority before better-off masters
does making out slave weakness matter choice e
relabeling meekness
good man master morality precisely evil man slave morality while bad man recast good man
nietzsche sees slave-morality source nihilism overtaken europe
modern europe christianity exist hypocritical state due tension master slave morality both values contradictorily determining varying degrees values most europeans motley
nietzsche calls exceptional people no longer ashamed their uniqueness face supposed morality-for-all deems harmful flourishing exceptional people
cautions however morality per se bad good masses should left them
exceptional people other hand should follow their own inner law
favorite motto nietzsche taken pindar reads become you
long standing assumption nietzsche preferred master over slave morality
however nietzsche scholar walter kaufmann rejected interpretation writing nietzsche's analyses these two types morality used descriptive historic sense meant any kind acceptance glorifications
daybreak nietzsche begins campaign against morality
calls himself immoralist harshly criticizes prominent moral philosophies day christianity kantianism utilitarianism
nietzsche also known being very critical western belief egalitarianism rationality
[citation needed] nietzsche's concept god dead applies doctrines christendom though other faiths claimed buddhism successful religion compliments fostering critical thought
still nietzsche saw philosophy counter-movement nihilism through appreciation art art single superior counterforce against will negation life art anti-christian anti-buddhist anti-nihilist par excellence
nietzsche claimed christian faith practised proper representation jesus' teachings forced people merely believe way jesus act jesus particular example refusing judge people something christians constantly done opposite
condemned institutionalized christianity emphasizing morality pity mitleid assumes inherent illness society christianity called religion pity
pity stands opposed tonic emotions heighten our vitality depressing effect
deprived strength feel pity
loss strength suffering such inflicts life still further increased multiplied pity
pity makes suffering contagious
ecce homo nietzsche called establishment moral systems based dichotomy good evil calamitous error wished initiate re-evaluation values judeo-christian world
indicates desire bring new naturalistic source value vital impulses life itself
while nietzsche attacked principles judaism antisemitic work genealogy morality explicitly condemns antisemitism points out attack judaism attack contemporary jewish people specifically attack upon ancient jewish priesthood whom claims antisemitic christians paradoxically based their views upon
modern antisemitism felt despicable against european ideals
cause opinion growth european nationalism endemic jealousy hatred jewish success
jews should thanked helping uphold respect philosophies ancient greece giving rise noblest human being christ purest philosopher spinoza mightiest book most effective moral code world
death god nihilism main articles god dead nihilism statement god dead occurring several nietzsche's works notably gay science become best-known remarks
basis most commentators regard nietzsche atheist others such kaufmann suggest statement reflects subtle understanding divinity
recent developments modern science increasing secularization european society effectively 'killed' abrahamic god served basis meaning value west thousand years
death god may lead beyond bare perspectivism outright nihilism belief nothing any inherent importance life lacks purpose
here states christian moral doctrine provides people intrinsic value belief god justifies evil world basis objective knowledge
sense constructing world objective knowledge possible christianity antidote primal form nihilism—the despair meaninglessness
heidegger put problem god suprasensory ground goal reality dead suprasensory world ideas suffered loss obligatory above vitalizing upbuilding power then nothing remains man cling orient himself
such reaction loss meaning nietzsche calls passive nihilism recognises pessimistic philosophy schopenhauer
schopenhauer's doctrine—which nietzsche also refers western buddhism—advocates separating oneself will desires order reduce suffering
nietzsche characterises ascetic attitude will nothingness whereby life turns away itself there nothing value found world
moving away value world characteristic nihilist although nihilist appears inconsistent nihilist man judges real world ought world ought does exist
according view our existence action suffering willing feeling no meaning 'in vain' nihilists' pathos—an inconsistency part nihilists
— friedrich nietzsche ksa 129 taken will power section 585 translated walter kaufmann nietzsche approaches problem nihilism deeply personal stating problem modern world problem become conscious
furthermore emphasizes both danger nihilism possibilities offers seen statement praise reproach [nihilism's] arrival

whether man recovers whether becomes master crisis question strength! according nietzsche nihilism overcome culture true foundation thrive
wished hasten coming also hasten ultimate departure
heidegger interprets death god explains death metaphysics
concludes metaphysics reached potential ultimate fate downfall metaphysics proclaimed statement god dead
will power main article will power basic element nietzsche's philosophical outlook will power wille zur macht maintained provides basis understanding human behavior—more competing explanations such ones based pressure adaptation survival
such according nietzsche drive conservation appears major motivator human animal behavior exceptions general condition life emergency 'struggle existence'
often self-conservation consequence creature's will exert strength outside world
presenting theory human behavior nietzsche also addressed attacked concepts philosophies popularly embraced days such schopenhauer's notion aimless will utilitarianism
utilitarians claim moves people mainly desire happy accumulate pleasure their lives
such conception happiness nietzsche rejected something limited characteristic bourgeois lifestyle english society instead put forth idea happiness aim per se—it instead consequence successful pursuit one's aims overcoming hurdles one's actions—in other words fulfillment will

does nietzsche posit universe recurring over infinite time space different versions events occurred past may point another take place again hence configurations previously existed earth must yet meet
