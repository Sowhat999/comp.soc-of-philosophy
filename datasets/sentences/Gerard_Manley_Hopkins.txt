poetry sprung rhythm pied beauty glory god dappled things— skies couple-colour brinded cow rose-moles stipple upon trout swim fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls finches' wings landscape plotted pieced—fold fallow plough áll trádes their gear tackle trim
things counter original spare strange whatever fickle freckled knows how? swift slow sweet sour adazzle dim fathers-forth whose beauty past change praise
“ ”pied beauty written 1877
much hopkins's historical importance changes brought form poetry ran contrary conventional ideas metre
prior hopkins most middle english modern english poetry based rhythmic structure inherited norman side english literary heritage
structure based repeating groups two three syllables stressed syllable falling same place each repetition
hopkins called structure running rhythm though early verse running rhythm became fascinated older rhythmic structure anglo-saxon tradition beowulf most famous example
hopkins called own rhythmic structure sprung rhythm
sprung rhythm structured around feet variable number syllables generally four syllables per foot stress falling first syllable foot
similar rolling stresses robinson jeffers another poet rejected conventional metre
hopkins saw sprung rhythm way escape constraints running rhythm inevitably pushed poetry written become same tame
way hopkins sprung rhythm seen anticipating much free verse
work no great affinity either contemporary pre-raphaelite neo-romanticism schools although does share their descriptive love nature often seen precursor modernist poetry bridge two poetic eras
use language language hopkins’s poems often striking
imagery simple heaven-haven comparison nun entering convent ship entering harbour out storm
splendidly metaphysical intricate kingfishers catch fire leaps image another show how each thing expresses own uniqueness how divinity reflects itself through them
uses many archaic dialect words also coins new words
example twindles seems context inversnaid mean combination twines dwindles
often creates compound adjectives sometimes hyphen such dapple-dawn-drawn falcon often without rolling level underneath steady air
concentrates images communicating instress poet’s perceptions inscape reader
hopkins supporter linguistic purism english
1882 letter robert bridges hopkins writes makes weep think english might spite shakespeare milton done [
no beauty language make up want purity
took time learn old english became major influence writing
same letter bridges calls old english vastly superior thing now
added richness comes hopkins’s extensive use alliteration assonance onomatopoeia rhyme both end lines internally kingfishers catch fire dragonflies draw flame tumbled over rim roundy wells stones ring like each tucked string tells each hung bell’s bow swung finds tongue fling out broad name hopkins influenced welsh language acquired while studying theology st beuno's near st asaph
poetic forms welsh literature particularly cynghanedd emphasis repeating sounds accorded own style became prominent feature work
reliance similar sounding words close differing senses mean poems best understood read aloud
important element work hopkins's own concept inscape derived part medieval theologian duns scotus
exact detail inscape uncertain probably known hopkins alone individual essence uniqueness every physical thing
communicated object instress ensures transmission item's importance wider creation
poems then try present inscape poem like windhover aims depict bird general instead instance relation breeze
just interpretation hopkins's most famous poem felt best
caught morning morning’s minion king- dom daylight’s dauphin dapple-dawn-drawn falcon riding rolling level underneath steady air striding high there how rung upon rein wimpling wing ecstasy! then off off forth swing skate’s heel sweeps smooth bow-bend hurl gliding rebuffed big wind
my heart hiding stirred bird—the achieve mastery thing! “ ”the first stanza windhover written 30 may 1877 published 1918
during lifetime hopkins published few poems
through efforts robert bridges works seen
despite hopkins burning poems entering jesuit novitiate already sent bridges few other friends few people see many them years
after hopkins's death distributed wider audience mostly fellow poets 1918 bridges then poet laureate published collected edition expanded edition prepared charles williams appeared 1930 greatly expanded edition william henry gardner appeared 1948 eventually reaching fourth edition 1967 n
notable collections hopkins's manuscripts publications campion hall oxford bodleian library oxford foley library gonzaga university spokane washington
erotic influences contemporary critics believe hopkins' suppressed erotic impulses played important role tone quality even content works
these impulses seem taken degree specificity after met robert bridges's distant cousin friend fellow etonian digby mackworth dolben christian uranian
hopkins biographer robert bernard martin asserts hopkins first met dolben dolben's 17 th birthday oxford february 1865 quite simply most momentous emotional event [his] undergraduate years probably entire life
hopkins completely taken dolben nearly four years junior private journal confessions following year proves how absorbed imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts
gerard manley hopkins hopkins kept up correspondence dolben diary composed two poems art thou friend beginning end
robert bridges edited first edition dolben's poems well hopkins's cautioned second poem must never printed though bridges himself included first edition 1918
another indication nature feelings dolben hopkins's high anglican confessor seems forbidden any contact dolben except letter
their relationship abruptly ended dolben's drowning june 1867 event greatly affected hopkins although feeling dolben seems cooled good deal time
ironically fate may bestowed through dolben’s death ever bestowed through longer life
[for] many hopkins’s best poems — impregnated elegiac longing dolben lost beloved muse — result
poems such bugler's first communion epithalamion arguably embody homoerotic themes although second poem arranged robert bridges extant fragments
contemporary literary critic m
kaylor argued hopkins's inclusion uranian poets group whose writings derived many ways prose works walter pater hopkins's academic coach greats exams later lifelong friend
critics argued homoerotic readings either highly tendentious classified under broader category homosociality over gender sexual-specific homosexual term
hopkins’s journal writings argue offer clear admiration feminized beauty
book hopkins reconstructed 2000 justus george lawler critiques robert martin’s controversial biography gerard manley hopkins very private life suggesting martin cannot see heterosexual beam
homosexual biographical mote own eye
amounts slanted eisegesis
poems elicit homoerotic readings read merely exercises sublimation powerful renditions religious conviction conviction caused strain family even led burn poems felt unnecessarily self-centered
julia saville’s book queer chivalry views religious imagery poems hopkins’s way expressing tension homosexual identity desire
male figure christ allows safely express such feelings mitigates political implications
