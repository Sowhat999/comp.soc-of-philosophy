philosophy strauss politics philosophy necessarily intertwined
regarded trial death socrates moment political philosophy came existence
strauss considered most important moments history philosophy socrates' argument philosophers study nature without considering their own human nature words aristotle political animal
strauss distinguished scholars great thinkers identifying himself scholar
most self-described philosophers actuality scholars cautious methodical
great thinkers contrast boldly creatively address big problems
scholars deal these problems indirectly reasoning great thinkers' differences
natural right history strauss begins critique max weber's epistemology briefly engages relativism martin heidegger goes unnamed continues discussion evolution natural rights via analysis thought thomas hobbes john locke
concludes critiquing jean-jacques rousseau edmund burke
heart book excerpts plato aristotle cicero
much philosophy reaction works heidegger
indeed strauss heidegger's thinking must understood confronted before any complete formulation modern political theory possible entails political thought engage issues ontology history metaphysics
strauss friedrich nietzsche first philosopher properly understand historicism idea grounded general acceptance hegelian philosophy history
heidegger strauss' view sanitized politicized nietzsche whereas nietzsche believed our own principles including belief progress will become unconvincing alien earlier principles essences shown themselves way out seems
voluntarily choose life-giving delusion instead deadly truth fabricate myth
heidegger believed tragic nihilism nietzsche myth guided defective western conception being heidegger traced plato
published correspondence alexandre kojève strauss hegel correct postulated end history implies end philosophy understood classical political philosophy
strauss reading strauss's study philosophy political discourses produced islamic civilization above those al-farabi maimonides instrumental development theory reading
late 1930 s strauss called first time reconsideration distinction exoteric public esoteric secret teaching
1952 published persecution art writing arguing serious writers write esoterically multiple layered meanings often disguised within irony paradox obscure references even deliberate self-contradiction
esoteric writing serves several purposes protecting philosopher retribution regime protecting regime corrosion philosophy attracts right kind reader repels wrong kind ferreting out interior message itself exercise philosophic reasoning
taking bearings study maimonides al farabi pointing further back plato's discussion writing contained phaedrus strauss proposed classical medieval art esoteric writing proper medium philosophic learning rather displaying philosophers' thoughts superficially classical medieval philosophical texts guide their readers thinking learning independently imparted knowledge
thus strauss agrees socrates phaedrus greek indicates insofar writing does respond questioned good writing provokes questions reader—questions orient reader towards understanding problems author thought utmost seriousness
strauss's general hermeneutical argument—rearticulated throughout subsequent writings most notably city man —is prior 19 th century western scholars commonly understood philosophical writing home any polity no matter how liberal
insofar questions conventional wisdom roots philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers believe themselves authoritative wise liberal defenders status quo
questioning established opinions investigating principles morality philosophers old found necessary convey their messages oblique manner
their art writing art esoteric communication
especially apparent medieval times heterodox political thinkers under threat inquisition comparably obtuse tribunals
strauss's argument medieval writers studies reserved exoteric meaning many hoi polloi esoteric hidden few hoi aristoi through rhetorical stratagems including self-contradiction hyperboles these writers succeeded conveying their proper meaning tacit heart their writings—a heart message irreducible letter historical dimension texts
explicitly following g
lessing's lead strauss indicates medieval political philosophers no less their ancient counterparts carefully adapted their wording dominant moral views their time lest their writings condemned heretical unjust many read those few whom many regarded most righteous guardians morality
precisely these righteous personalities most inclined persecute/ostracize anyone business exposing noble great lie upon authority few over many stands falls
according critics especially shadia drury strauss wrongly assumes distinction exoteric salutory esoteric true aspect philosophy pre-modern political philosophers
furthermore strauss often accused having himself written esoterically
accusation seem rest upon belief modern liberal societies especially usa philosophers free voice their philosophical views public without being accused impropriety
example found argument exoteric portion text cover story esoteric portion text real part
way plato termed noble lie serves impart distance unpopular truths esoteric text
strauss maintained socrates' line reasoning dialogue thrasymachus exoteric cover story while real truth actually oratory thrasymachus
problems arise immediately reader may able discern philosopher's real intent shadows language becomes tightrope narcotic whipsaw

strauss treated politics something studied afar

schmitt's positive reference approval strauss's work hobbes instrumental winning strauss scholarship funding allowed leave germany
strauss's critique clarifications concept political led schmitt make significant emendations second edition
writing schmitt 1932 strauss summarised schmitt's political theology because man nature evil therefore needs dominion
dominion established men unified unity against—against other men
every association men necessarily separation other men
political thus understood constitutive principle state order condition state
strauss however directly opposed schmitt's position
strauss schmitt return thomas hobbes helpfully clarified nature our political existence our modern self-understanding
schmitt's position therefore symptomatic modern liberal self-understanding
strauss believed such analysis hobbes's time served useful preparatory action revealing our contemporary orientation towards eternal problems politics social existence

strauss contrary believed philosophers should play role politics extent ensure philosophy saw mankind's highest activity free political intervention
liberalism nihilism strauss taught liberalism modern form contained within intrinsic tendency towards extreme relativism turn led two types nihilism first brutal nihilism expressed nazi marxist regimes
tyranny these ideologies both descendants enlightenment thought tried destroy traditions history ethics moral standards replace them force under nature mankind subjugated conquered
second type—the gentle nihilism expressed western liberal democracies—was kind value-free aimlessness hedonistic permissive egalitarianism saw permeating fabric contemporary american society

resultant study led advocate tentative return classical political philosophy starting point judging political action
strauss's interpretation plato's republic according strauss republic plato blueprint regime reform play words karl popper's open society enemies attacks republic being just
strauss quotes cicero republic does bring light best possible regime rather nature political things—the nature city
strauss argued city-in-speech unnatural precisely because rendered possible abstraction eros
eros means bodily needs
though skeptical progress strauss equally skeptical political agendas return—that going backward instead forward
fact consistently suspicious anything claiming solution old political philosophical problem
spoke danger trying finally resolve debate rationalism traditionalism politics
particular along many pre-world war ii german right feared people trying force world state come being future thinking inevitably become tyranny
hence kept distance totalitarianisms century right-wing fascists left-wing communists
strauss karl popper strauss actively rejected karl popper's views illogical
agreed letter response request eric voegelin look issue

while strauss maintained sympathetic interest zionism later came refer zionism problematic became disillusioned aims

religious belief although strauss espoused utility religious belief there question views truth

strauss however openly disdainful atheism made apparent writings max weber
especially disapproved contemporary dogmatic disbelief considered intemperate irrational felt should either philosopher open challenge theology theologian open challenge philosophy

gadamer stated 'largely agreed' strauss's interpretations
critical views strauss critics strauss accused being elitist illiberalist anti-democratic
shadia drury leo strauss american right 1999 claimed strauss inculcated elitist strain american political leaders linked imperialist militarism neoconservatism christian fundamentalism
drury argues strauss teaches perpetual deception citizens those power critical because need led need strong rulers tell them what's good them
nicholas xenos similarly argues strauss anti-democrat fundamental sense true reactionary
xenos says strauss somebody wanted go back previous pre-liberal pre-bourgeois era blood guts imperial domination authoritarian rule pure fascism
strauss also criticized conservatives
according claes ryn strauss's anti-historicist thinking creates artificial contrast moral universality conventional ancestral historical
strauss ryn argues wrongly reductively assumes respect tradition must undermine reason universality
contrary strauss's criticism edmund burke historical sense may fact indispensable adequate apprehension universality
strauss's abstract ahistorical conception natural right actually distorts genuine universality ryn contends
strauss does consider possibility real universality becomes known human beings concretized particular form
strauss straussians paradoxically taught philosophically unsuspecting american conservatives least roman catholic intellectuals reject tradition favor ahistorical theorizing bias flies face central christian notion incarnation represents synthesis universal historical
according ryn propagation purely abstract idea universality contributed neoconservative advocacy allegedly universal american principles neoconservatives see justification american intervention around world—bringing blessings west benighted rest
strauss's anti-historical thinking connects followers french jacobins also regarded tradition incompatible virtue rationality
ryn calls new jacobinism neoconservative philosophy writes paul edward gottfried also rhetoric saint-just trotsky philosophically impoverished american right taken over mindless alacrity
republican operators think tanks apparently believe carry electorate appealing yesterday’s leftist clichés
journalists such seymour hersh opined strauss endorsed noble lies myths used political leaders seeking maintain cohesive society
city man strauss discusses myths outlined plato's republic required governments

smith robert alter writes smith persuasively sets record straight strauss's political views writing really
smith rejects link strauss neoconservative thought link commentators controversially made arguing strauss never personally active politics never endorsed imperialism questioned utility political philosophy practice politics
particular strauss argued plato's myth philosopher king should read reductio ad absurdum philosophers should understand politics order influence policy ensure philosophy's autonomy politics
additionally mark lilla argued attribution strauss neoconservative views contradicts careful reading strauss' actual texts particular tyranny
lilla summarizes strauss follows philosophy must aware dangers tyranny threat both political decency philosophical life
must understand enough politics defend own autonomy without falling error thinking philosophy shape political world according own lights

bush administration such unrealistic hopes spread liberal democracy through military conquest professor nathan tarcov director leo strauss center university chicago article published american interest asserts strauss political philosopher essentially non-political
after exegesis very limited practical political views gleaned strauss's writings tarcov concludes strauss remind us permanent problems ourselves blame our faulty solutions problems today
likewise strauss's daughter jenny strauss clay new york times article defended strauss against charge mastermind behind neoconservative ideologues control united states foreign policy
conservative she says insofar think change necessarily change better
since contemporary academia leaned left unquestioned faith progress science combined queasiness regarding any kind moral judgment strauss stood outside academic consensus
academia leaned right he'd questioned too—and certain occasions question tenets right
straussianism straussianism name given denote research methods common concepts theoretical presuppositions central questions pedagogic style characteristic large number conservatives influenced thought teaching leo strauss
while particularly influential among university professors historical political theory
also sometimes serves common intellectual framework generally among conservative activists think tank professionals public intellectuals
within discipline political theory method calls practitioners use 'close reading' 'great books' political thought strive understand thinker 'as understood himself' unconcerned questions historical context historical influences given author strive open idea may find something timelessly true great book
approach resembles important ways old new criticism literary studies
there controversy approach over distinguishes great book lesser works
great books held written authors/philosophers such sovereign critical self-knowledge intellectual power no way reduced general thought their time place other works understood epiphenomenal original insights thinker first rank
approach seen counter historicist presuppositions mid-twentieth century read history political thought progressivist way past philosophies forever cut off us superseded past
straussianism puts forward possibility past thinkers may hold truth—and recent thinkers therefore wrong
