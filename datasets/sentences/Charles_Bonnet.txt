bonnet's philosophical system may outlined follows
man compound two distinct substances mind body immaterial other material
knowledge originates sensations sensations follow whether physical effects merely sequents bonnet will say vibrations nerves appropriate each lastly nerves made vibrate external physical stimulus
nerve once set motion particular object tends reproduce motion second time receives impression same object vibrates less resistance
sensation accompanying increased flexibility nerve according bonnet condition memory
reflection—that active element mind—is applied acquisition combination sensations those abstract ideas formed though generally distinguished thus merely sensations combination
puts mind activity pleasure pain happiness end human existence
bonnet's metaphysical theory based two principles borrowed leibniz first there successive acts creation universe completed single original act divine will thereafter moves own inherent force secondly there no break continuity existence
divine being originally created multitude germs graduated scale each inherent power self-development
every successive step progress universe these germs progressively modified advance nearer perfection advanced others there gap continuity chain
thus man other forms existence immortal
nor man's mind alone immortal body also will pass higher stage indeed body now possesses finer germ present exists within
impossible however reach absolute perfection because distance infinite
final proposition bonnet violates own principle continuity postulating interval highest created being divine
also difficult understand whether constant advance perfection performed each individual each race beings whole
there seems fact oscillation two distinct analogous doctrines—that constantly increasing advancement individual future stages existence constantly increasing advancement race whole according successive evolutions globe
philosophical palingesis ideas past future states living beings 1770 bonnet argued females carry within them future generations miniature form
believed these miniature beings sometimes called homonculi able survive even great cataclysms such biblical flood predicted moreover these catastrophes brought evolutionary change after next disaster men become angels mammals gain intelligence
bonnet influence other philosophers pre-evolutionary thinkers james burnett lord monboddo known studied publications insects influenced developed concepts progression species evolution
