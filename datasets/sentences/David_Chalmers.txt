thought philosophy mind chalmers stage alan turing year event de salle university manila march 27 chalmers best known formulation notion hard problem consciousness both 1996 book 1995 paper facing up problem consciousness
makes distinction easy problems consciousness such explaining object discrimination verbal reports single hard problem stated why does feeling accompanies awareness sensory information exist all? essential difference cognitive easy problems phenomenal hard problem former least theoretically answerable via standard strategy philosophy mind functionalism
chalmers argues explanatory gap objective subjective criticizes physical explanations mental experience making dualist
chalmers characterizes view naturalistic dualism naturalistic because believes mental states caused physical systems such brains dualist because believes mental states ontologically distinct reducible physical systems
support chalmers famous commitment logical though importantly natural possibility philosophical zombies although first propose thought experiment
these zombies unlike zombie popular fiction complete physical duplicates human beings lacking qualitative experience
chalmers argues since such zombies conceivable us must therefore logically possible
since logically possible then qualia sentience fully explained physical properties alone
instead chalmers argues consciousness fundamental property ontologically autonomous any known even possible physical properties there may lawlike rules terms psychophysical laws determine physical systems associated types qualia
further speculates information-bearing systems may conscious leading entertain possibility conscious thermostats qualified panpsychism calls panprotopsychism
chalmers maintains formal agnosticism issue even conceding viability panpsychism places odds majority contemporaries

these papers daniel dennett colin mc ginn francisco varela francis crick roger penrose among others collected published book explaining consciousness hard problem
john searle critiqued chalmers's views new york review books
andy clark chalmers written extended mind article borders mind
philosophy language chalmers published works theory reference concerning how words secure their referents
together others such frank jackson proposes kind theory called two dimensionalism arguing against saul kripke
before kripke delivered famous lecture series naming necessity 1970 descriptivism advocated gottlob frege bertrand russell orthodoxy
descriptivism suggests name indeed abbreviation description set properties later modified john searle disjunction properties
name secures reference process properties fitting whichever object fits description most then referent name
therefore description seen connotation fregean terms sense name via sense denotation name determined
however kripke argued naming necessity name does secure reference via any process description fitting
rather name determines reference via historical-causal link tracing back process naming
thus kripke thinks name does sense least does sense rich enough play reference-determining role
moreover name kripke's view rigid designator refers same object possible worlds
following line thought kripke suggests any scientific identity statement such water h2 o also necessary statement
true possible worlds
kripke thinks phenomenon descriptivist cannot explain
also proposed hilary putnam kripke himself kripke's view names also applied reference natural kind terms
kind theory reference advocated kripke putnam called direct reference theory
however chalmers disagrees kripke direct reference theorists general
thinks there two kinds intension natural kind term stance now called two dimensionalism
example words water h2 o taken express two distinct propositions often referred primary intension secondary intension together compose meaning
primary intension word sentence sense
idea method find referent
primary intension water might description such watery stuff
thing picked out primary intension water otherwise
example other world inhabitants take water mean watery stuff chemical make-up watery stuff h2 o case water h2 o world
secondary intension water whatever thing water happens pick out world whatever world happens
assign water primary intension watery stuff then secondary intension water h2 o since h2 o watery stuff world
secondary intension water our world h2 o h2 o every world because unlike watery stuff impossible h2 o other h2 o
considered according secondary intension water means h2 o every world
via secondary intension chalmers proposes way simultaneously explain necessity identity statement preserve role intension/sense determining reference
philosophy verbal disputes recent work chalmers concentrated verbal disputes
argues dispute best characterized verbal concerns sentence s contains term t such parties dispute disagree over meaning t ii dispute arises solely because disagreement
same work chalmers proposes certain procedures resolution verbal disputes
these calls elimination method involves eliminating contentious term observing whether any dispute remains
