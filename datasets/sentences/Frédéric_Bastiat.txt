negative railroad famous section economic sophisms concerns way tariffs inherently counterproductive
bastiat posits theoretical railway spain france built order reduce costs trade two countries
achieved course making goods move two nations faster easily
bastiat demonstrates situation benefits both countries' consumers because reduces cost shipping goods therefore reduces price market those goods
however each country's producers begin criticize their governments because other country's producers now provide certain goods domestic market reduced price
domestic producers these goods afraid being outcompeted newly viable industry other country
these domestic producers demand tariffs enacted artificially raise cost foreign goods back their pre-railroad levels continue compete
bastiat makes two significant statements here even producers society benefited these tariffs bastiat claims consumers society clearly hurt tariffs now unable secure goods want low price should able secure them
tariffs completely negate any gains made railroad therefore make essentially pointless
further demonstrate statements bastiat suggests—in classic reductio ad absurdum—that rather enacting tariffs government should simply destroy railroad anywhere foreign goods outcompete local goods
since just everywhere goes suggest government should simply build broken negative railroad right start waste time tariffs rail building
