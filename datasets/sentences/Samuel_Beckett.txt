works caricature beckett edmund s
valtman beckett's career writer roughly divided three periods early works up until end world war ii 1945 middle period stretching 1945 until early 1960 s during period probably best-known works late period early 1960 s until beckett's death 1989 during works tended become shorter style minimalist
early works beckett's earliest works generally considered strongly influenced work friend james joyce
erudite seem display author's learning merely own sake resulting several obscure passages
opening phrases short-story collection pricks kicks 1934 affords representative sample style morning belacqua stuck first canti moon
bogged move neither backward nor forward
blissful beatrice there dante also she explained spots moon
she shewed first place fault then she put up her own explanation
she god therefore rely being accurate every particular
passage makes reference dante's commedia serve confuse readers familiar work
also anticipates aspects beckett's later work physical inactivity character belacqua character's immersion own head thoughts somewhat irreverent comedy final sentence
similar elements present beckett's first published novel murphy 1938 also explores themes insanity chess both recurrent elements beckett's later works
novel's opening sentence hints somewhat pessimistic undertones black humour animate many beckett's works sun shone having no alternative nothing new
watt written while beckett hiding roussillon during world war ii similar terms themes less exuberant style
explores human movement mathematical permutation presaging beckett's later preoccupation—in both novels dramatic works—with precise movement
beckett's 1930 essay proust strongly influenced schopenhauer's pessimism laudatory descriptions saintly asceticism
time beckett began write creatively french language
late 1930 s number short poems language their sparseness—in contrast density english poems roughly same period collected echo's bones other precipitates 1935—seems show beckett albeit through medium another language process simplifying style change also evidenced watt
middle period may tell tale old man? weigh absence scale? mete want span? sum assess world's woes? nothingness words enclose? “ ”from watt 1953 after world war ii beckett turned definitively french language vehicle
together revelation experienced mother's room dublin—in realized art must subjective drawn wholly own inner world—that result works beckett best remembered today
during 15 years following war beckett produced four major full-length stage plays en attendant godot written 1948–1949 waiting godot fin de partie 1955–1957 endgame krapp's last tape 1958 happy days 1961
these plays—which often considered rightly wrongly instrumental so-called theatre absurd—deal very blackly humorous way themes similar those roughly contemporary existentialist thinkers
term theatre absurd coined martin esslin book same name beckett godot centerpieces book
esslin claimed these plays fulfilment albert camus's concept absurd reason beckett often falsely labeled existentialist based assumption camus existentialist though fact broke off existentialist movement founded own philosophy
though many themes similar beckett little affinity existentialism whole
broadly speaking plays deal subject despair will survive spite despair face uncomprehending incomprehensible world
words nell—one two characters endgame trapped ashbins occasionally peek their heads speak—can best summarize themes plays beckett's middle period nothing funnier unhappiness grant you
yes yes it's most comical thing world
laugh laugh will beginning
it's same thing
yes it's like funny story heard too often still find funny don't laugh any
beckett's outstanding achievements prose during period three novels molloy 1951 malone meurt 1951 malone dies l'innommable 1953 unnamable
these novels—sometimes referred trilogy though against author's own explicit wishes—the prose becomes increasingly bare stripped down
molloy instance still retains many characteristics conventional novel time place movement plot makes use structure detective novel
malone dies movement plot largely dispensed though there still indication place passage time action book takes form interior monologue
finally unnamable almost sense place time abolished essential theme seems conflict voice's drive continue speaking continue existing almost equally strong urge towards silence oblivion
despite widely held view beckett's work exemplified novels period essentially pessimistic will live seems win out end witness instance famous final phrase unnamable 'i can't go i'll go on'
after these three novels beckett struggled many years produce sustained work prose struggle evidenced brief stories later collected texts nothing
late 1950 s however created most radical prose works comment c'est 1961 how
early variant version comment c'est l'image published british arts review x quarterly review 1959 first appearance novel any form
work relates adventures unnamed narrator crawling through mud while dragging sack canned food
written sequence unpunctuated paragraphs style approaching telegraphese you there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch time then it's over you there no alive no again you there again alive again wasn't over error you begin again over less same place another another image above light you come hospital dark following work almost another decade before beckett produced work non-dramatic prose
how generally considered mark end middle period writer
late works time she stopped sitting her window quiet her window window facing other windows other windows eyes sides high low time she stopped “ ”from rockaby 1980 throughout 1960 s 1970 s beckett's works exhibited increasing tendency—already evident much work 1950 s—towards compactness
led work sometimes being described minimalist
extreme example among dramatic works 1969 piece breath lasts 35 seconds no characters though likely intended offer ironic comment oh! calcutta! theatrical revue served introductory piece
portrait reginald gray theatre late period beckett's characters—already few number earlier plays—are whittled down essential elements
ironically titled play 1962 instance consists three characters immersed up their necks large funeral urns
television drama eh joe 1963 written actor jack mac gowran animated camera steadily closes tight focus upon face title character
play 1972 consists almost solely beckett's words moving mouth rest stage darkness
following krapp's last tape many these later plays explore memory often form forced recollection haunting past events moment stillness present
also deal theme self confined observed voice either comes outside protagonist's head eh joe else another character comments protagonist silently means gesture
beckett's most politically charged play catastrophe 1982 dedicated václav havel deals relatively explicitly idea dictatorship
after long period inactivity beckett's poetry experienced revival during period ultra-terse french poems mirlitonnades short six words long
these defied beckett's usual scrupulous concern translate work original other two languages several writers including derek mahon attempted translations no complete version sequence published english
beckett's prose pieces during late period prolific theatre suggested title 1976 collection short prose texts fizzles american artist jasper johns illustrated
beckett experienced something renaissance novella company 1980 continued ill seen ill 1982 worstward ho 1984 later collected nohow
these three 'closed space' stories beckett continued preoccupation memory effect confined observed self well positioning bodies space opening phrases company make clear voice comes dark
back dark
tell pressure hind parts how dark changes shuts eyes again opens them again
small part verified
example hears you your back dark
then must acknowledge truth
themes aloneness doomed desire successfully connect other human beings expressed several late pieces including company rockaby
hospital nursing home spent final days beckett last work 1988 poem word comment dire
poem grapples inability find words express oneself theme echoing beckett's earlier work though possibly amplified sickness experienced late life
