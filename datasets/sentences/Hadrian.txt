way such account trajan's reign book 69 work roman history cassius dio
dio's original text particular book lost survives brief much later byzantine era abridgment th century monk xiphilinius made selection dio's account hadrian's reign based mostly religious interests covering bar kokhba war relatively fully exclusion much else
hadrian first imperial biography historia augusta notorious unreliability work mish mash actual fact cloak dagger sword sandal sprinkling ubu roi does allow use source without care
hadrian's biography generally considered relatively free fictional additions
contemporary greek authors such philostratus pausanias shortly after hadrian's reign offer information hadrian's relations provincial greek world fronto latin correspondence sheds light general character reign's internal policies
case trajan using epigraphical numismatic archaeological other non-literary sources absolutely necessary tracing detailed historical account
early life hadrian born publius aelius hadrianus either italica rome well-established roman family centuries-old roots italica hispania baetica republican hispania ulterior near present-day location seville spain
although accepted part hadrian's personal history born spain historia augusta biography states born rome 24 january 76 ethnically hispanic vague paternal links italy
however may complimentary fiction coined order make hadrian appear natural-born roman instead provincial since parents grandparents great-grandparents born raised hispania
father publius aelius hadrianus afer senator praetorian rank spend much time rome away homeland hispania
hadrian's known paternal ancestry partially linked family hadria modern atri ancient town picenum italy
family settled italica hispania baetica soon after founding scipio africanus several centuries before hadrian's birth
father afer paternal cousin future emperor trajan
both afer trajan born raised hispania
mother domitia paulina came gades cádiz
paulina daughter distinguished hispano-roman senatorial family
paternal great-grandmother unknown origin means exact amount paternal ancestry actually linked italy outside nonspecific claims forebears picenum centuries earlier ultimately unknown
hadrian's elder sister sibling aelia domitia paulina married triple consul lucius julius ursus servianus niece julia serviana paulina great-nephew gnaeus pedanius fuscus salinator barcino barcelona
parents died 86 hadrian ten boy then became ward both trajan publius acilius attianus later trajan's praetorian prefect
hadrian schooled various subjects particular young aristocrats day fond learning greek literature nicknamed graeculus greekling
hadrian visited italica never left until 14 years old recalled trajan thereafter looked after development
never returned italica although later made colonia honour
public service after start vigintivirate minor posts whose holding qualified senatorial cursus hadrian's first military service tribune legio ii adiutrix
exceptionally held second tribunate afterwards transferred legio v macedonica such capacity chosen inform trajan adoption nerva
then retained germany presumably trajan's orders transferred hold even exceptional third tribunate legio xxii primigenia
fact three spells military service instead just two customary regular senator points thorough military career gave hadrian advantage terms military expertise over most scions older senatorial families
nerva died 98 hadrian rushed inform trajan personally coming advance official envoy sent governor hadrian's brother-in-law rival lucius julius ursus servianus may fiction coined hadrian himself
101 hadrian began senatorial career being chosen quaestor being charged task reading trajan's speeches senate possibly composing them himself
next ab actis senatus charged task keeping senate's record proceedings
next created tribune plebs
then began surrounded stories omens portents supposedly announced future imperial condition
according historia augusta hadrian great interest astrology divination announced future accession empire grand-uncle himself skilled astrologer
also noteworthy however trajan make hadrian patrician allow become consul earlier without having hold office tribune
during first dacian war hadrian member trajan's personal entourage being excused military post order take office rome tribune plebs
during second dacian war also relieved early trajan's personal attendance becoming legate legion legio minervia afterwards governor lower pannonia
therefore hadrian received signal honour assuming tribunate plebs year earlier customary same time departed early both dacian campaigns sign trajan wanted out way
time married trajan's grandniece vibia sabina move seems conceived empress plotina whose favour counted
also counted support bride's mother trajan's niece salonina matidia daughter trajan's sister ulpia marciana
however trajan seemed far less enthusiastic
subsequent relationship hadrian sabina exceptionally scandalously poor even marriage convenience
also hadrian time involved unexplained quarrel historia augusta around relationships trajan's boy favourites whom supposedly tried groom
these circumstances might explain downturn experienced hadrian's fortunes late during trajan's reign
hadrian failed achieve honour regular consulate before own reign being suffect consul 108
much trajan surely actively promoted hadrian's advancement same time very measured careful way
nevertheless sabina's grandmother ulpia marciana died 112 114 she deified senate her daughter salonina matidia made princess blood augusta
made hadrian late during trajan's reign first senator history augusta mother-in-law something contemporaries fail notice
time mid-twenties hadrian travelled greece attended lectures stoic philosopher epictetus time living city nicopolis
also eponymous archon athens brief time elected athenian citizen
athenians awarded hadrian statue inscription theater dionysus offering detailed account cursus honorum confirms expands historia augusta
hadrian's career before trajan's death regular high ranking roman senator without any particular distinction befitting heir designate
after 112 athenian archontate hear no hadrian before trajan's parthian war possible remained greece until being summoned imperial retinue
career before becoming emperor attested epigraphically athens inscription follows decemvir stlitibus iudicandis sevir turmae equitum romanorum praefectus urbi feriarum latinarum tribunus militum legionis ii adiutricis piae fidelis 95 pannonia inferior tribunus militum legionis v macedonicae 96 moesia inferior tribunus militum legionis xxii primigeniae piae fidelis 97 germania superior quaestor 101 ab actis senatus tribunus plebis 105 praetor 106 legatus legionis minerviae piae fidelis 106 germania inferior legatus augusti pro praetore pannoniae inferioris 107 consul suffectus 108 septemvir epulonum before 112 sodalis augustalis before 112 archon athenis 112/13 afterwards legatus syriae 117
hadrian involved wars against dacians legate v macedonica reputedly won awards trajan successes
hadrian's military skill well-attested due lack military action during reign however keen interest knowledge army demonstrated skill leadership show possible strategic talent
hadrian joined trajan's expedition against parthia legate trajan's staff
neither during first victorious phase nor during second phase war rebellion swept mesopotamia hadrian anything note
however governor syria sent sort out renewed troubles dacia hadrian appointed replacement giving independent command
trajan seriously ill time decided return rome while hadrian remained syria guard roman rear
practical terms meant hadrian de facto general commander eastern roman army something made power position potential claimant throne unchallengeable
trajan got far selinus before became too ill go further
while hadrian may obvious choice successor never adopted trajan's heir
possible trajan never wanted commit himself earlier appointment successor great number potential claimants made possible definite choice heir seen abdication therefore dash chance transmission power orderly way
trajan lay dying nursed wife plotina closely watched prefect attianus last adopted hadrian heir
since document signed plotina suggested trajan may already dead
telltale sign discovered trajan's young manservant phaedimus died late twenties few days after trajan's passing away selinus body interred rome twelve years later
phaedimus probably very close trajan perhaps killed killed himself fear being posed awkward questions
emperor 117 securing power roman empire 125 under rule hadrian castel sant'angelo ancient hadrian mausoleum famous statue hadrian greek dress revealed 2008 forged victorian era cobbling together head hadrian unknown body
years statue used historians proof hadrian's love hellenic culture
even trajan's adoption hadrian genuine came too late keep other potential claimants having wrong ideas
therefore hadrian act own secure newly won position
hadrian quickly secured support legions potential opponent moorish prince outstanding general lusius quietus promptly dismissed taking quietus personal guard moorish auxiliaries hadrian afterwards safely relieve post governor judea
senate's endorsement followed possibly falsified papers adoption trajan presented
according these papers hadrian adopted absentia 9 august 117 trajan having died august technically irregular two parties concerned required present ceremony
rumour falsified document adoption carried little weight hadrian's legitimacy arose endorsement senate above support syrian armies
nevertheless various public ceremonies organized egyptian papyri tell organized 117 118 ce extolling fact hadrian divinely chosen deified father gods themselves
statue hadrian unearthed tel shalem commemorating roman military victory over bar kochba displayed israel museum hadrian first go rome busy sorting out east suppressing jewish revolt broken out under trajan then moving sort out danube frontier
instead attianus hadrian's former guardian put charge rome
there discovered conspiracy involving four leading senators including lusius quietus demanded senate their deaths
there no question public trial hunted down killed out hand
because hadrian rome time able claim attianus acted own initiative
according elizabeth speller real reason their deaths trajan's men
better reason their elimination simply four prominent senators consular rank such prospective candidates imperial office capaces imperii
also four consulars chiefs war hawk group senators committed trajan's expansionist policies hadrian intended change
consistent refusal hadrian expand frontiers remain bone contention senate throughout reign
hadrian's instrument getting rid four consulars prefect attianus made senator promoted consular rank being afterwards discarded hadrian suspected personal ambition
probable attianus executed already dead end hadrian's reign
four consulars episode however strain hadrian's relations senate entire reign
tense relationship hadrian's authoritarian stance towards senate acknowledged generation later fronto himself senator letters marcus aurelius praised deified hadrian your grandfather senate number occasions great enthusiasm willingly too [
respectfully acknowledging your devotion towards your grandfather wanted appease assuage hadrian mars gradivus dis pater rather love
strain relationship hadrian senate however never took form overt confrontation happened during reigns other previous bad emperors hadrian knew how remain aloof order avoid open clash
senate's political role however effaced behind hadrian's personal rule ronald syme's view hadrian führer duce caudillo
fact hadrian spend half reign away rome constant travel undoubtedly helped management strained relationship
hadrian however underscored autocratic character reign counting day acclamation armies dies imperiii enforcing new laws through imperial decree constitution instead having them approved senate formality
hadrian military despite own great reputation military administrator hadrian's reign marked general lack documented major military conflicts apart second roman–jewish war
however disturbances danubian frontier early reign led killing governor dacia caius julius quadratus bassus hadrian responded placing then equestrian governor mauretania caesariensis q
marcius turbo long record distinguished military service joint governor dacia pannonia inferior powers prefect
shortly after decided hadrian part dacia added province moesia inferior present-day southern moldavia wallachian plain surrendered roxolani sarmatians whose king rasparaganus received roman citizenship client king status possibly increased subsidy
roman partial withdrawal probably supervised governor moesia quintus pompeius falco
presence hadrian dacian front juncture implied unreliable historia augusta merely conjectural
hadrian visit dacia course subsequent travels nevertheless included subsequent monetary series coins allegories provinces
notion contemplated idea withdrawing dacia altogether stated eutropius appears therefore unfounded
hadrian already surrendered trajan's conquests mesopotamia considering them indefensible
east hadrian contented himself retaining suzerainty over osroene ruled client king parthamaspates once client king parthia under trajan
there almost new war parthia around 121 threat averted hadrian succeeded negotiating peace
late reign 135 invasion alani capadocia covertly supported king caucasian iberia pharasmanes successful repulsed hadrian's governor historian arrian greek intellectual fellow student epictetus appointed senate hadrian ruled capadocia imperial legate 131 137
after defeating alans arrian subsequently installed roman adviser iberia
abandonment aggressive policy something senate historians never forgave hadrian fourth century historian aurelius victor charged being jealous trajan's exploits deliberately trying downplay their worthiness traiani gloriae invidens
probable hadrian simply considered financial strain incurred keeping policy conquests something roman empire afford proof disappearance during reigns two entire legions legio xxii deiotariana famous lost legion ix hispania possibly destroyed during late trajanic uprising brigantes britain
also acknowledgement indefensible character mesopotamian conquests perhaps already made trajan himself disengaged them time death
peace policy strengthened erection permanent fortifications along empire's borders limites sl
most famous these massive hadrian's wall great britain built stone doubled rear ditch vallum hadriani marked boundary strictly military zone province
danube rhine borders strengthened series mostly wooden fortifications forts outposts watchtowers latter specifically improving communications local area security
these defensive activities however generated very few literary records information hadrian built wall britain found entire corpus ancient authors historia augusta biography
then hadrian's military activities certain measure ideological emphasized community interests peoples living within roman empire instead hegemony conquest centered city rome senate
maintain morale prevent troops becoming restive hadrian established intensive drill routines personally inspected armies
although coins showed military images almost often peaceful ones hadrian's policy peace through strength even threat emphasis disciplina discipline subject two monetary series
emphasis spit polish heartily praised cassius dio saw useful deterrent therefore cause general peaceful character hadrian's reign
fronto however expressed other opinions subject view hadrian liked play war games enjoyed giving eloquent speeches armies like series addresses inscribed column made while inspection tour during 128 new headquarters legio iii augusta lambaesis rather actual warfare
general fronto very critical hadrian's pacifist policy charging decline military standards roman army own time
however hadrian least systematized employment numeri ethnic non-citizen troops special weapons such eastern mounted archers low-intensity defensive tasks such dealing infiltrators skirmishers
using numeri economic way avoid frequent deployment legions suffered dearth recruits italy well romanized provinces
cultural pursuits patronage hadrian obverse aureus hadrian described firstly ancient anonymous source later echoed ronald syme among others most versatile roman emperors varius multiplex multiformis
also liked demonstrate knowledge intellectual artistic fields
above hadrian patronized arts hadrian's villa tibur tivoli greatest roman example alexandrian garden recreating sacred landscape albeit lost large part despoliation ruins cardinal d'este much marble removed build villa d'este
rome pantheon originally built agrippa destroyed fire 80 rebuilt under hadrian working blueprint left trajan see below domed form retains day
among best-preserved rome's ancient buildings highly influential many great architects italian renaissance baroque periods
well before reign hadrian displayed keen interest architecture seems eagerness well received
example apollodorus damascus famed architect forum trajan dismissed designs
trajan predecessor hadrian consulted apollodorus architectural problem hadrian interrupted give advice apollodorus replied go away draw your pumpkins
you know nothing these problems
pumpkins refers hadrian's drawings domes like serapeum villa
historian cassius dio once hadrian succeeded trajan become emperor apollodorus exiled later put death
story however problematical archaeological evidence brickstamps consular dates demonstrated e
pantheon's dome already under construction late trajan's reign 115 probably under apollodorus's sponsorship
hadrian poetry both latin greek few surviving examples latin poem reportedly composed deathbed see below
greek productions found their way palatine anthology
also autobiography historia augusta says published under name hadrian's freedman phlegon tralles
apparently work great length revelation designed scotch various rumours explain hadrian's most controversial actions
possible autobiography form series open letters antoninus pius
hadrian passionate hunter time youth according source
northwest asia founded dedicated city commemorate she-bear killed
documented egypt beloved antinous killed lion
rome eight reliefs featuring hadrian different stages hunting decorate building began monument celebrating kill
another hadrian's contributions popular culture fact generalized mores imperial elites beard symbolised philhellenism dio prusa equated generalized using beard hellenic ethos
since time scipio africanus fashionable among romans clean-shaven
also roman emperors before hadrian except nero also great admirer greek culture clean shaven
most emperors after hadrian portrayed beards
their beards however worn out appreciation greek culture because beard thanks hadrian become fashionable
new fashion lasted until reign constantine great revived again phocas start 7 th century
notwithstanding philhellenism however other everyday life matters hadrian behaved roman civic traditionalist demanded use toga senators knights public strict separation sexes public baths theaters
cultural hellenophile hadrian familiar work philosophers epictetus heliodorus favorinus
home attended social needs
hadrian mitigated slavery masters forbidden killing their slaves unless allowed court punish them grave offense
masters forbidden sell slaves gladiator trainer lanista procurer except justified punishment
hadrian also legal code humanized forbade torture free defendants witnesses legislating against common practice condemning free persons order them tortured means gathering information their supposed activities accomplices
also abolished ergastula private prisons slaves kidnapped free men also kept
however hadrian's humanitarian views limit namely existence slavery itself confronted crowd demanded freeing popular slave charioteer replied free slave belonging another person
also hadrian least once personally engaged cruelty toward slave fit rage stabbed eye secretaries pen
built libraries aqueducts baths theaters
hadrian considered many historians wise just schiller called empire's first servant british historian edward gibbon admired vast active genius well equity moderation
1776 stated hadrian's era part happiest era human history
while visiting greece 131–132 hadrian attempted create kind provincial parliament bind semi-autonomous former city states across greece ionia asia minor
parliament known panhellenion generally conceived failed albeit spirited effort foster cooperation among hellenes
however german sociologist georg simmel remarked aim panhellenion probably render hellenism inert divert feeling common hellenic identity towards ideal purposes games commemorations preservation ideal entirely non-political hellenism
hadrian died villa baiae
buried mausoleum western bank tiber rome building later transformed papal fortress castel sant'angelo
dimensions mausoleum original form deliberately designed slightly larger earlier mausoleum augustus
according cassius dio gigantic equestrian statue erected hadrian after death
large bulkiest man walk through eye each horse yet because extreme height foundation persons passing along ground below believe horses themselves well hadrian very very small
may refer huge statuary group placed atop mausoleum disappeared later time depicting hadrian driving four-horse quadriga chariot
hadrian's travels purpose most distinctive aspect hadrian's reign fact emperor spend half outside italy engaged peaceful pursuits
obviously other emperors often left rome long periods then mostly go war returning soon after conflicts concluded
previous emperor nero once travelled through greece condemned self-indulgence
according modern historians such paul veyne hadrian intended incessant travelling nero failed achieve break sedentary casanière tradition previous emperors saw empire purely roman hegemony instead hadrian sought make subjects feel part commonwealth civilized peoples sharing common hellenic culture
why hadrian speech senate preserved aulus gellius supported creation new municipia autonomous urban communities their own customs laws over creation new colonies urban communities standard roman constitution
go well roman traditionalism far historia augusta portrays traditional ideology hadrian regarded author little too much greek far cosmopolitan thought fit roman emperor
significance hadrian's travels means stressing cosmopolitan ecumenical character roman empire confirmed late during reign hadrian struck series special issue coins representing allegories various provinces
hadrian traveled integral part governing something made clear roman senate people
order check roman populace made recourse chief equestrian adviser marcius turbo made pretorian prefect 121 while still joint-governor dacia pannonia inferior task adjudicate non-senators
turbo long career procurator regarded leading men equestrian order
nonetheless qualified keep check senate hadrian forbade equestrians try cases against senators
senate ultimate legal authority over members remained formally highest court appeal appealing emperor forbidden
there hints within certain sources hadrian also employed secret police force frumentarii ad hoc occasional basis snoop primarily people high social standing such close friends
visits marked handouts often contained instructions construction new public buildings
intention strengthen empire within through improved infrastructure opposed conquering annexing perceived enemies
often purpose journeys commissioning new structures projects settlements
almost evangelical belief greek culture strengthened views like many emperors before hadrian's will almost obeyed
later greek rhetorician aelius aristides extol activities writing extended over subjects protecting hand raising them helps fallen men their feet
travelling court large including administrators probably also architects builders
burden areas passed through sometimes great
while arrival usually brought benefits possible those bear burden different class those reaped benefits
example huge amounts provisions requisitioned during visit egypt suggests burden mainly subsistence farmers must intolerable causing measure starvation hardship
same time later times way through european renaissance kings welcomed their cities lands financial burden completely them indirectly poorer class
hadrian's first tour came just four years after assuming office caesar sought cure skin disease thought leprosy travelled judea roman province while en route egypt
time also allowed freedom concern himself general cultural aims
point travelled north towards germania inspected rhine–danube frontier allocating funds improve defences
however voyage empire's very frontiers represented perhaps most significant visit upon hearing recent revolt journeyed britannia
britannia west 122 hadrian's wall vallum hadriani fortification northern england viewed vercovicium
hadrian's gate antalya southern turkey built honour hadrian visited city 130
prior hadrian's arrival britain there major rebellion britannia 119 121
although operations britannia time got no mention worthy note literary sources inscriptions tell expeditio britannica involving major troop movements including sending vexillatio
detachment 3000 men taken legions stationed rhine spain fronto writes military losses britannia time
historia augusta notes britons kept under roman control pompeius falco sent britain restore order coins 119–120 refer
122 hadrian initiated construction hadrian's wall
wall built separate romans barbarians according historia augusta
deterred attacks roman territory lower cost massed border army controlled cross-border trade immigration
unlike germanic limes built wood palisades hadrian's wall primarily stone construction
western third wall modern-day carlisle river irthing originally built turf unknown reasons
possibly hasten construction wall's width narrowed sections original planned 12 feet 7
turf wall however later rebuilt stone large ditch adjoining mounds known today vallum dug south wall
under hadrian shrine erected york britain goddess coins introduced female figure personification britain labelled britannia struck
end 122 hadrian concluded visit britannia there headed south mauretania never return
thus never saw finished wall bears name
hadrian appears gone mauretania through southern gaul probable visited nemausus may overseen building basilica dedicated plotina meanwhile died rome
plotina due course deified hadrian's prompting
shortly before her death hadrian already granted plotina signal favour stating succession head epicurean school athens granted non-roman citizen petition made incumbent head school seeking plotina's intercession
matidia augusta hadrian's mother-in-law died earlier december 119 also deified
both deifications these prominent female members trajan's family might seen effort hadrian buttress legitimacy
appears same time hadrian dismissed secretary charge official correspondence ab epistulis historian suetonius excessive familiarity towards empress
also dismissed same alleged reason marcius turbo's colleague praetorian prefect gaius septicius clarus
given clarus' high office alleged reason dismissal merely pretext remove office
hadrian spent winter 122/123 spain tarraco restored temple augustus before crossing mediterranean mauretania
africa parthia anatolia antinous 123–124 123 arrived mauretania personally led campaign against local rebels
however visit short reports came through eastern nation parthia again preparing war result hadrian quickly headed eastwards
journey east known point visited cyrene during time personally made available funds training young men well-bred families roman military
cyrene already benefited generosity 119 provided funds rebuilding public buildings destroyed recent jewish revolt
rebuilding lasted until late reign 138 statue zeus erected dedication hadrian saviour founder cyrene
hadrian arrived euphrates characteristically solved problem through negotiated settlement parthian king osroes
then proceeded check roman defences before setting off west along coast black sea
probably spent winter nicomedia main city bithynia
nicomedia hit earthquake shortly prior stay hadrian generous providing funds rebuilding acclaimed chief restorer province whole
possible hadrian visited claudiopolis there espied beautiful antinous young boy destined become emperor's beloved
sources say nothing hadrian met antinous however there depictions antinous show young man 20
shortly before antinous's death 130 earliest date sure antinous' being together hadrian antinous 123 most likely youth 13 14
possible antinous sent rome trained page serve emperor gradually rose status imperial favourite
fact however actual history antinous/hadrian relationship mostly unknown
without antinous hadrian travelled through anatolia
route took uncertain
various incidents described such founding city within mysia hadrianutherae after successful boar hunt
building city probably mere whim sparsely populated wooded areas such location new city already ripe development
historians dispute whether hadrian fact commission city's construction
time plans complete temple zeus cyzicus begun kings pergamon put practice
temple whose completion contemplated trajan received colossal statue hadrian built dazzling white marble gold thread
cyzicus received additional honor being declared regional center imperial cult neocoros sharing pergamon smyrna ephesus sardes something offered benefits imperial sponsorship sacred games attracting tourism stimulating private expenditure well channeling intercity rivalry common acceptance roman rule
greece 124–125 temple zeus athens pantheon rebuilt hadrian
climax tour destination hadrian must mind along greece
arrived autumn 124 time participate eleusinian mysteries
tradition stage ceremony initiates supposed carry arms waived avoid any risk emperor
athenians' request conducted revision their constitution among other things new phyle tribe added bearing name
also system coercive purchases oil imposed athenian producers order ensure adequate supply commodity management system left hands local assembly council appeals emperor notwithstanding
athens also became provincial city benefit regular supply grain
hadrian also created two foundations provide funding athens' public games whenever there no citizen wealthy enough willing sponsor them gymnasiarch agonothetes
usually however hadrian preferred civic expenditure greek notables should concentrate buildings rather spectacles competitions letter aphrodisias praised requirement high priests imperial cult donate funds works aqueduct rather gladiatorial games
such aqueducts associated public fountains nymphaea hadrian's additions greek urban landscape besides athens two such fountains built argos also received similar project
possibly time hadrian received according eusebius apology
defense christian faith made two christians quadratus aristides
apparently hadrian simply kept trajan's policy passive tolerance christians should sought after sentenced after due trial
rescript addressed proconsul asia minutius fundanus preserved justin martyr hadrian laid down accusers christians bear burden proof their denunciations pain being punished calumnia defamation
during winter toured peloponnese
exact route uncertain however pausanias reports tell-tale signs such temples built hadrian statue emperor heroic nudity built grateful citizens epidaurus thanks their restorer
especially generous mantinea restored temple poseidon hippios supports theory antinous fact already hadrian's lover because strong link mantinea antinous's home bithynia
however kinship mantinea bythinia itself mythological fiction kind used time encouraging political alliances polities serious reason might exist hadrian's particular generosity
hadrian's buildings greece no mere whims followed pattern favoring old religious centers besides temple mantinea hadrian restored other ancient shrines abae argos restored heraion megara
way gathering legitimacy roman imperial rule associating glories classical greece something well line contemporary antiquarian taste cultural matters
hadrian credited pausanias restoring mantinea ancient classical name named antigoneia since hellenistic times honor macedonian king antigonus iii doson
same idea resurrecting classical past under roman overlordship behind possibility during tour peloponnese hadrian persuaded spartan grandee eurycles herculanus contemporary leader euryclid family ruled sparta since augustus' day enter senate alongside athenian grandee herodes atticus elder
two aristocrats first greeks old greece enter roman senate representatives two great powers classical age
important step overcoming greek notables' haughty disdain their reluctance take part roman political life
march 125 hadrian reached athens presiding over festival dionysia
building program hadrian initiated substantial
various rulers done work building temple olympian zeus over timespan five centuries hadrian vast resources command ensured job finished
also initiated construction several public buildings own whim even organized building aqueduct
return italy trip africa 126–128 return italy hadrian made detour sicily
coins celebrate restorer island though there no record earn accolade
back rome able see himself completed work rebuilding pantheon
also completed then hadrian's villa nearby tibur pleasant retreat sabine hills whenever rome became too much
beginning march 127 hadrian set off tour italy
once again historians able reconstruct route evidence hand-outs rather historical records
instance year restored picentine earth goddess cupra town cupra maritima
unspecified time improved drainage fucine lake
less welcome such largesse decision 127 divide italy four regions under imperial legates consular rank jurisdiction over italy excluding rome itself therefore shifting cases courts rome
actually four consulars acted governors regions assigned them
having italy effectively reduced status group mere provinces go down well italian hegemonic feelings especially roman senate innovation long outlive hadrian
hadrian fell ill around time though nature sickness known
whatever illness stop setting off spring 128 visit africa
arrival began good omen rain ending drought
along usual role benefactor restorer found time inspect troops speech troops survives day
hadrian returned italy summer 128 stay brief set off another tour last three years
greece asia egypt 128–130 antinous' death hadrian antinous busts british museum september 128 hadrian again attended eleusinian mysteries
time visit greece seems concentrated athens sparta two ancient rivals dominance greece
hadrian played idea focusing greek revival around amphictyonic league based delphi now decided something far grander
new panhellenion going council bring greek cities together
meeting place new temple zeus athens
having set motion preparations deciding whose claim greek city genuine itself take time hadrian set off ephesus
notion greek city however mostly political mythological rather historical involved fabricated claims greek origins imperial favour
most importantly linked appreciation idealized cultural hellenism loyalty rome her emperor
panhellenion devised view associating roman emperor protection greek culture liberties greece case urban self-government
allowed hadrian appear fictive heir pericles supposedly convened previous panhellenic congress mentioned way biography plutarch whose sympathies imperial order well-known
epigraphical evidence suggests however prospect applying panhellenion raised less interest wealthier cities asia minor jealous athenian european greek preeminence
hadrian defined hellenism narrow archaizing manner no hellenistic foundations admitted panhellenion hadrian defined greekness terms classical roots alone
greece hadrian proceeded way asia egypt
known inscription time probably conveyed across aegean entourage ephesian lucius erastus behalf whom later sent letter council ephesus stating erastus wanted become town councillor hadrian willing pay honorary sum required entrance council ephesians regarded erastus merchant probably snubbed upon unfit civic prominence worthy fill such position
egypt hadrian opened stay restoring pompey great's tomb pelusium
hadrian also offered sacrifice pompey hero composed epigram tomb
pompey universally acknowledged conqueror roman east restoration probably linked need reaffirm roman eastern hegemony after recent disturbances there during trajan's late reign
also egypt poem lion hunt libyan desert greek pankrates witnesses first time antinous travelled alongside hadrian
october 130 while hadrian entourage sailing nile antinous drowned unknown reasons accident suicide murder religious sacrifice postulated
historia augusta offers following account during journey nile lost antinous favourite youth wept like woman
concerning incident there varying rumours claim devoted himself death hadrian others both beauty hadrian's sensuality suggest
however may greeks deified hadrian's request declared oracles given through agency these commonly asserted composed hadrian himself
time hadrian turned personal initiative persona antinous low-status non-citizen greek something far surpassing usual imperial boy favourite sexual interest
deeply saddened hadrian founded egyptian city antinopolis memory antinous deified unprecedented honour ruling family
although hadrian criticized intensity grief antinous's death attempt turning deceased youth cult-figure found little opposition
cult antinous become very popular greek-speaking world
suggested hadrian created cult political move reconcile greek-speaking east roman rule
existence copy hadrian's villa famous statue pair tyrannicides bearded aristogeiton clean-shaven harmodios certain way linked imperial favourite classical tradition greek love opposition usual roman distrust greek pederasty
italy west cult also found supporters inscription tivoli antinous compared celtic sun-god belenos
medals struck antinous' effigy statues erected parts empire kinds garb including egyptian dress
temples built worship bithynia mantineia arcadia
athens festivals celebrated honour oracles delivered name
site chosen city antinopolis antinoe ruins besa vicinity antinous's death-place
city proper greek polis however besides benefitting alimentary scheme similar trajan's alimenta also allowed citizens privilege marrying members native population without disenfranchising themselves proof hadrian intended again use local religious cult case egyptianized means integrating native populations celebration roman rule
antinous's cult differed previous imperial cult instead centering worshipping emperor ruler involved emperor well subjects common religious activity thereby emphasizing sense shared community
eventually very successful
international cult figure antinous enduring fame far outlasting hadrian's reign local coins effigy still being struck during caracalla's reign invoked poem celebrate accession diocletian
greece east return rome 130–133 hadrian’s movements subsequent founding antinopolis 30 october 130 obscure
whether returned rome traveled east during 130/131 see below spent winter 131–32 athens dedicated olympeion probably remained greece went east because jewish rebellion broke out judaea 132 see below
inscriptions make clear took field person against rebels army 133 then returned rome probably year almost certainly again judging inscriptions via illyricum
third final trip greek east produced much religious enthusiasm region centered around hadrian received personal cult deity numerous monuments civic homages according religious syncretism time
legal reforms state apparatus around time hadrian enacted through jurist salvius julianus become first attempt codify roman law perpetual edict according various forms legal action introduced yearly pretors remain fixed
practical meaning measure law no longer changed magistrate's personal interpretation law become fixed statute emperor alter
same time following procedure initiated domitian hadrian professionalized emperor's legal advisory board prince's counsel consilia principis became permanent body staffed salaried legal aides
doing hadrian developed professional bureaucracy consisting mainly equestrians replacing earlier freedmen imperial household control political field instead senate's individual members innovation marked superseding surviving republican institutions openly autocratic political system
hadrian's bureaucracy supposed carry out administrative functions earlier exercised old magistrates therefore objectively detract senate's position new civil servants free men such supposed act behalf interests crown emperor individual
however senate never accepted loss prestige caused emergence new aristocracy alongside placing additional strain already troubled relationship senate emperor hallmark end hadrian's reign
hadrian judea second roman–jewish war jewish persecution 132–136 see also bar kokhba revolt coinage minted mark hadrian's visit judea porphyry statue hadrian discovered caesarea israel 130/131 hadrian toured east bestowing honorific titles many regional centers
palmyra received state visit given civic name hadriana palmyra
hadrian also bestowed honors various palmyrene magnates among them soados lived parthian city vologesias go-between done much protect palmyrene trade roman empire parthia
then hadrian visited ruins jerusalem roman judaea left after first roman–jewish war 66–73
according midrashic tradition first showed himself sympathetic jews allegedly planning city rebuilt allowing rebuilding temple samaritans catalyst sedition changed mind
reliability tradition however doubtful
account stands sharp contradiction alternate tradition hadrian deciding build temple roman god jupiter ruins temple mount other temples various roman gods throughout jerusalem including large temple goddess venus
according modern scholar giovanni bazzana hadrian's original intention may rebuild jerusalem roman colony such vespasian done earlier caesarea maritima various honorific fiscal privileges well pagan population
accepted usual roman policy other colonies involved exempting jewish population participating roman religious rituals
demanded jewish communities political support roman imperial order attested caesarea epigraphy attests jewish citizens served roman army during both 66 132 rebellions
speculated hadrian intended assimilate jewish temple civic-religious basis support reign doing greek other traditional places worship
also ventured hadrian attempted unify belief systems empire coherent whole serve basis support autocratic legitimacy project already devised earlier hellenized jewish intellectuals such philo
neighbouring samaritans already undergone such process hellenization religious syncretism integrating their religious rites hellenistic ones
hadrian probably sanctioned hellenized samaritan worship after suppression jewish revolt built temple hellenistic probably syncretic god zeus hypsistos highest mount gerizim
attempt conciliation judaism hellenism however foundered faced strict jewish monotheism
therefore romans appear surprised outbreak uprising
evidence failure integrate judaism unified religious system lies fact after war hadrian even renamed jerusalem itself aelia capitolina after himself jupiter capitolinus chief roman deity
according epiphanius hadrian appointed aquila sinope pontus overseer work building city seeing aquila related marriage
hadrian placed city's main forum junction main cardo decumanus maximus now location smaller muristan
tradition based historia augusta suggests tensions grew higher hadrian abolished circumcision brit milah hellenist viewed mutilation
however scholar peter schäfer maintains there no evidence claim given notoriously problematical nature historia augusta source tomfoolery shown writer particular relevant passage fact contemporary roman legislation genital mutilation seems address general issue castration slaves their masters
actually hadrian issued rescript blanket ban castration performed freeman slave voluntarily pain death both performer patient
castration legally put hadrian par conspiracy murder accordingly punished terms lex cornelia de sicaris et veneficis
notion antisemitic legislation hadrian therefore possibly anachronistic midrashic words modern scholar reading ancient sources
possible other issues intervened hadrian's intention rebuild jerusalem outbreak war tension incoming roman colonists supporters appropriated land confiscated after first jewish war landless poor well existence messianic groups triggered interpretation jeremiah's prophecy promising temple rebuilt seventy years after destruction repeating timing restoration first temple after babylonian exile something put restoration second temple around 140
hadrian's anti-jewish policies alternatively assimilation policies means cultural political hellenization triggered judaea massive anti-hellenistic anti-roman jewish uprising led simon bar kokhba
based delineation years eusebius' chronicon now chronicle jerome 16 th year hadrian's reign equivalent 4 th year 227 th olympiad jewish revolt began under roman governor tineius tynius rufus asked army crush resistance
bar kokhba leader resistance punished any jew refused join ranks
according justin martyr eusebius mostly christian converts opposed bar kokhba's messianic claims
then hadrian called general sextus julius severus britain troops brought far danube
fifth macedonian legion eleventh claudian legion also took part war operations judea time
roman losses very heavy compared fronto casualties earlier british uprising believed entire legion xxii deiotariana according epigraphy outlast hadrian's reign destroyed rebellion
indeed roman losses heavy hadrian's report roman senate omitted customary salutation you your children health well legions health
hadrian's army eventually put down rebellion 135
according cassius dio overall war operations land judea left 580000 jews killed 50 fortified towns 985 villages razed ground
most famous battle took place beitar fortified city 10 km
southwest jerusalem
city fell after lengthy siege three half years time hadrian prohibited jews burying their dead
eventually afforded burial antoninus pius succeeded hadrian roman emperor
according babylonian talmud after war hadrian continued persecution jews
roman inscription found near battir mentioning 5 th th roman legions rabbinical sources however seem concerned morals religion conveying history therefore occasionally such writings known contain embellished accounts war aftermath according whom hadrian attempted root out judaism saw cause continuous rebellions prohibited torah law hebrew calendar executed judaic scholars see ten martyrs
sacred scroll ceremonially burned temple mount
attempt erase memory judaea renamed province syria palaestina after philistines name found herodotus' histories jews barred entering rededicated capital
jewish sources mention hadrian epitaph may bones crushed שחיק עצמות שחיק טמיא aramaic equivalent expression never used even respect vespasian titus destroyed second temple
other modern scholars contend hadrian's strictures circumcision no-entry policy jews poorly enforced falling abeyance death
namely hadrian's legislation castration amended antoninus pius order allow jews circumcise their own sons jewish proselytism among male converts remaining forbidden
spite enslavement jewish war prisoners their suffering high war casualties wanton destruction proposed palestine remained predominantly jewish population well culture religious life fact reflected completion mishnah early third century 220 ce
however jerusalem talmud compiled 2 nd 3 rd century ce speaks areas palestine time wholly supplanted non-jewish peoples owing sparseness jewish citizens
jerusalem remained special case due fact rebuilt purely roman city circumstance later christian authors like eusebius took advantage order stress character christian city worship center
therefore extent punitive measures taken hadrian against jewish population remains matter continuing debate present-day historiography
hadrian's bloody repression revolt undoubtedly accomplish put end any measure jewish political independence alongside roman imperial order
rabbinic literature rabbinic literature critical hadrian's policy particularly religious intolerance concerning jews
indeed policies viewed attack religious freedom practice torah law
most stories related sages israel reflect two-faced approach tolerance jewish people
story punishes jew failed greet then punishes another jew wished well
asked logic punishing both men replied you wish give me advice how kill my enemies? another story hadrian got down chariot bowed jewish girl afflicted leprosy
queried soldiers why hadrian responded dual verse book isaiah praise nation israel says god redeemer israel downtrodden soul made repulsive nation kings will view stand
malbim commentary book daniel comments how hadrian erected statue himself site bet ha mikdash day marking anniversary temple's destruction titus
according jewish historical records time famous rabbi scholar contemporary hadrian rabbi yehoshua son hananiah opposed any jewish military intervention against occupying roman army spite rome's harsh decrees against jewish people
rabbi yehoshua reported saying lion once pounced upon prey got bone stuck throat
then 'whosoever comes takes out will give reward
egyptian heron came along whose bill long reaching down lion's throat extracted bone
bird then lion 'give me my reward
lion replied 'just happy you say went down lion's mouth came out alive well
same us
enough gone nation came out our lives
final years succession bronze head hadrian found river thames london
now british museum
hadrian spent final years life rome
134 took imperial salutation end second jewish war actually concluded until following year
136 dedicated new temple venus roma former site nero's golden house
time suffering poor health turned problem succession
136 adopted ordinary consuls year lucius ceionius commodus took name lucius aelius caesar
son-in-law gaius avidius nigrinus four consulars executed 118 himself delicate health
also reputation voluptuous well educated great lord leader
already time ventured aelius commendation beauty piece gossip found way historia augusta biography
various modern attempts made justify apparently unjustified choice them advanced french historian jerome carcopino being aelius actually hadrian's natural son
also speculated hadrian fully aware aelius never outlive adoption aristocrat scion no blood ties emperor belated attempt make amends episode four consulars therefore aiming reconciliation powerful clan old italian families senate
four consulars aelius' father-in-law avidius nigrinus hadrian's chief rival throne senator highest rank breeding connections stoic
according historia augusta early reign hadrian even considered making nigrinus heir apparent before eventually deciding get rid worthy opponent
granted tribunician power joint governorship pannonia superior pannonia inferior commission discharged honorably according historia augusta aelius caesar held further consulship 137 died january 138
following death aelius caesar hadrian next adopted titus aurelius fulvus boionius arrius antoninus future emperor antoninus pius served five imperial legates italy post created hadrian proconsul asia
25 february 138 antoninus received tribunician power imperium
moreover ensure future dynasty hadrian required antoninus adopt both lucius ceionius commodus son deceased aelius caesar marcus annius verus grandson influential senator same name hadrian's close friend annius already betrothed aelius caesar’s daughter ceionia fabia
hadrian's precise intentions arrangement debatable
though consensus wanted annius verus later become emperor marcus aurelius succeed antoninus also argued actually intended ceionius commodus son own adopted son succeed constrained show favour simultaneously annius verus because strong connections hispano-narbonensian nexus senatorial families hadrian himself part
annius verus step-grandson then prefect rome lucius catilius severus remnants all-powerful group spanish senators trajan's reign unavoidable hadrian should show favor grandson order count grandfather's support
possible according prosopography catilius severus third last husband hadrian's mother domitia lucilla major
lucilla major's second husband publius calvisius ruso father domitia lucilla minor annius verus' mother lucilla minor actually hadrian's half-sister annius verus therefore halfnephew
case advancing annius verus hadrian promote own bloodline's fortunes
note however prosopography universally accepted other scholars argue hadrian's mother known according historia augusta domitia paulina
alternatively may well hadrian rather antoninus pius annius verus's uncle advanced latter principal position
fact annius divorce ceionia fabia remarry antoninus' daughter annia faustina points same direction
eventually became emperor marcus aurelius co-opt ceionius commodus co-emperor under name lucius verus own initiative
also there fact marcus aurelius already emperor behaved coldly towards memory adoptive grandfather conspicuously absent list people marcus acknowledged debt gratitude meditations
emperor marcus far attracted conservative serious roman outlook antoninus' reign hadrian's open lewd hellenic outlook including hadrian's almost exclusive homosexuality
noteworthy marcus aurelius's relationship towards antinous's memory total silence
ancient sources present hadrian's last few years marked conflict unhappiness
adoption aelius caesar proved unpopular least hadrian's brother-in-law lucius julius ursus servianus servianus's grandson gnaeus pedanius fuscus salinator
servianus though now far too old stood line succession beginning reign fuscus designs imperial power himself 137 may attempted coup grandfather implicated
whatever truth hadrian ordered both put death
servianus reported prayed before execution hadrian long death unable die
prayer fulfilled hadrian suffered final protracted illness prevented suicide several occasions
death hadrian died year 138 10 th july villa baiae age 62
cause death believed heart failure
dio cassius historia augusta record details failing health
buried first puteoli near baiae estate once belonged cicero
soon after remains transferred rome buried gardens domitia close almost-complete mausoleum
upon completion tomb hadrian rome 139 successor antoninus pius body cremated ashes placed there together those wife vibia sabina first adopted son lucius aelius also died 138
after threatening senate toyed refusing hadrian's divine honors refusing assume power himself antoninus eventually succeeded having predecessor deified 139 given temple campus martius ornamented reliefs representing provinces
senate consequence agreed give antoninus title pius filial piety granting adoptive father honors
same time order mark senate's illwill commemorative coinage honoring hadrian's consecration kept minimum
poem hadrian according historia augusta hadrian composed shortly before death following poem animula vagula blandula hospes comesque corporis quae nunc abibis loca pallidula rigida nudula nec ut soles dabis iocos
