marks transition strictly scientific philosophic work
lewes interested philosophy early youth earliest essays appreciative account hegel's aesthetics
under influence positivism auguste comte john stuart mill's system logic abandoned faith possibility metaphysics recorded abandonment history philosophy
yet any time give unqualified assent comte's teachings wider reading reflection mind moved further away positivist stance
preface third edition history philosophy avowed change direction movement even plainly discernible subsequent editions work
final outcome intellectual progress problems life mind
sudden death cut short work yet complete enough allow judgment author's matured conceptions biological psychological metaphysical problems
first two volumes foundations creed laid down lewes' foundation rapprochement metaphysics science
still positivist enough pronounce inquiry ultimate nature things fruitless matter form spirit themselves futile question belongs sterile region metempirics
philosophical questions may susceptible precise solution through scientific method
thus since relation subject object falls within our experience proper matter philosophic investigation
treatment question relation subject object confused scientific truth mind body coexist living organism philosophic truth knowledge objects implies knowing subject
shadworth hodgson's phrase mixed up genesis mental forms their nature see philosophy reflexion ii
thus reached monistic doctrine mind matter two aspects same existence attending simply parallelism psychical physical processes given fact probable fact our experience leaving out account their relation subject object cognitive act
identification two phases existence open criticism point view philosophy science
treatment such ideas sensibility sentience like does make clear whether speaking physical psychical phenomena
among other philosophic questions discussed these two volumes nature casual relation perhaps handled most freshness suggestiveness
third volume physical basis mind further develops writer's views organic activities whole
insists radical distinction organic inorganic processes impossibility explaining former purely mechanical principles
parts nervous system same elementary property sensibility
thus sensibility belongs much lower centres spinal cord brain former elementary form contributing subconscious region mental life while higher functions nervous system make up our conscious mental life complex modifications fundamental property nerve substance
nervous organism acts whole particular mental operations cannot referred definite regions brain hypothesis nervous activity isolated pathway nerve cell another altogether illusory
insisting complete coincidence regions nerve action sentience these different aspects thing able attack doctrine animal human automatism affirms feeling consciousness merely incidental concomitant nerve action no way essential chain physical events
lewes's views psychology partly explained earlier volumes problems fully worked out last two 3 rd series
discussed method psychology much insight
against comte followers claimed place introspection psychological research
well subjective method there must objective reference nervous conditions socio-historical data
biology help explain mental functions such feeling thinking help us understand differences mental faculty different races stages human development
organic conditions these differences will probably ever escape detection hence explained products social environment
relationship mental phenomena social historical conditions probably lewes's most important contribution psychology
also emphasised complexity mental phenomena
every mental state regarded compounded three factors different proportions sensible affection logical grouping motor impulse
lewes's work psychology consists less discoveries method
biological experience prepared view mind complex unity highest processes identical evolved out lower
thus operation thought logic signs complicated form elementary operations sensation instinct logic feeling
last volume problems illustrates position
valuable repository psychological facts many them drawn obscure regions mental life abnormal experience
suggest stimulate mind rather supply any complete system knowledge may lewes's service philosophy
exceptional rapidity versatility intelligence seems account once freshness way envisaging subject matter philosophy psychology want satisfactory elaboration systematic co-ordination
