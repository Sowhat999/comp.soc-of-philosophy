developed response philosophical dogmatism plato's academy time
aenesidemus argued contemporaries academy unjustified strongly affirming theories including ideas stoics while firmly denying others
argued should determine nothing meaning nothing should either affirmed denied
stated formally aenesidemus never assert statements x f x never f rather statements case x f case x never f
given seems under form scepticism acceptable statements negative ones
bases argument holds humans incapable knowing anything formalised ten tropes
ten tropes reasons epoché given often called ten tropes ten modes
argument follows different animals manifest different modes perception similar differences seen among individual men same man information perceived senses self-contradictory furthermore varies time time physical changes addition data differs according local relations objects known indirectly through medium air moisture etc
these objects condition perpetual change colour temperature size motion perceptions relative interact upon another our impressions become less critical through repetition custom men brought up different beliefs under different laws social conditions other words argues truth varies infinitely under circumstances whose importance another cannot accurately judged human observers
therefore rejects any concept absolute knowledge since every man different perceptions arranges sense-gathered data methods peculiar himself
arguments against causality second part work attacks theory causality
proofs arguments bear strong resemblance precepts modern skepticism
example argues cause no inherent existence rather exists within perceiving mind such validity ideal subjective
human mind true relation cause effect impossible determine
argues cause effect different then must occur either simultaneously succession
happen same time then essence cause effect effect cause
instead succession then cause must precede effect effect cannot precede cause therefore there must period time cause actually effective meaning essentially itself
through such arguments arrives fundamental principle scepticism radical universal opposition causes summed up phrase panti logo logos antikeitai every argument another argument opposed same strength
physical ethical theories having reached conclusion able assimilate physical theory heraclitus explained hypotyposes sextus empiricus
admitting contraries co-exist perceiving subject able assert co-existence contrary qualities same object
having thus disposed ideas truth causality proceeds undermine ethical criterion denies any man aim good pleasure happiness absolute concrete ideal
actions products pleasure pain good evil
