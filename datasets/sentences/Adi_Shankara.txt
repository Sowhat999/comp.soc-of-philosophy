however commentary mentions older commentaries like those dravida bhartrprapancha others either lost yet found
works doubtful authenticity authentic commentaries nrisimha-purvatatapaniya shveshvatara upanishads attributed adi shankara their authenticity highly doubtful

themes using ideas ancient indian texts shankara systematized foundation advaita vedanta th century ce six orthodox schools hinduism founded many centuries earlier badarayana
thematic focus extended beyond metaphysics soteriology laid strong emphasis pramanas epistemology means gain knowledge reasoning methods empower gain reliable knowledge
rambachan example summarizes widely held view aspect shankara's epistemology before critiquing follows according these [widely represented contemporary] studies shankara accorded provisional validity knowledge gained inquiry words śruti vedas see latter unique source pramana brahmajnana
affirmations śruti argued need verified confirmed knowledge gained through direct experience anubhava authority śruti therefore secondary
— anantanand rambachan sengaku mayeda concurs adding shankara maintained need objectivity process gaining knowledge vastutantra considered subjective opinions purushatantra injunctions śruti codanatantra secondary

merrell-wolff states shankara accepts vedas upanishads source knowledge develops philosophical theses yet never rests case ancient texts rather proves each thesis point point using pranamas epistemology reason experience
adi shankara text upadesasahasri discourages ritual worship such oblations deva god because assumes self within different brahman
doctrine difference wrong asserts shankara because knows brahman another does know brahman
however shankara also asserts self-knowledge realized one's mind purified ethical life observes yamas such ahimsa non-injury non-violence others body mind thoughts niyamas
rituals rites such yajna fire ritual asserts shankara help draw prepare mind journey self-knowledge
emphasizes need ethics such akrodha yamas during brahmacharya stating lack ethics causes prevent students attaining knowledge
adi shankara varyingly called influenced shaivism shaktism
however works philosophy suggest greater overlap vaishnavism influence yoga school hinduism most distinctly advaitin convictions monistic view spirituality

system marks turn realism idealism
advaita non-dualism interpretation sruti postulates identity self atman whole brahman[note 2]
according adi shankara unchanging entity brahman alone real while changing entities absolute existence

practice advaita vedanta based śāstra scriptures yukti reason anubhava experiential knowledge aided karmas spiritual practices
starting childhood learning start philosophy way life
shankara's primary objective understand explain how moksha achievable life means liberated free jivanmukta
philosophical thesis jivanmukti self-realization awareness oneness self universal spirit called brahman
shankara considered purity steadiness mind achieved yoga aid gaining moksha knowledge such yogic state mind cannot itself give rise such knowledge
shankara knowledge brahman springs inquiry teachings upanishads
method yoga encouraged shankara's teachings notes michael comans includes withdrawal mind sense objects patanjali's system complete thought suppression instead meditative exercise withdrawal particular identification universal leading contemplation oneself most universal namely consciousness
shankara rejected those yoga system variations suggest complete thought suppression leads liberation well view shrutis teach liberation something apart knowledge oneness self
knowledge alone insights relating true nature things taught shankara liberates
placed great emphasis study upanisads emphasizing them necessary sufficient means gain self-liberating knowledge
sankara also emphasized need role guru acharya teacher such knowledge
shankara's vedanta mahayana buddhism shankara's vedanta shows similarities mahayana buddhism opponents even accused shankara being crypto-buddhist qualification rejected advaita vedanta tradition given differences these two schools
according shankara major difference advaita mahayana buddhism their views atman brahman
according both loy jayatilleke differences discerned
differences atman according shankara hinduism believes existence atman while buddhism denies
shankara citing katha upanishad asserted hindu upanishad starts stating objective
investigation whether after death man soul exists assert soul exists soul does exist assert others
end states shankara same upanishad concludes words exists
buddhists lokāyatas shankara assert soul does exist
[note 3] there also differences understanding liberation means
nirvana term often used buddhism liberating realization acceptance there no self anatman
moksha term common hinduism liberating realization acceptance self universal soul consciousness one's oneness existence understanding whole universe self
logic versus revelation stcherbatsky 1927 criticized shankara demanding use logic madhyamika buddhists while himself resorting revelation source knowledge
[note 4] sircar 1933 offered different perspective stated sankara recognizes value law contrariety self-alienation standpoint idealistic logic consequently possible integrate appearance reality
recent scholarship states shankara's arguments revelation apta vacana sanskrit आप्तवचन sayings wise relying word testimony past present reliable experts
part advaita vedanta's epistemological foundation
advaita vedanta school considers such testimony epistemically valid asserting human being needs know numerous facts limited time energy available learn fraction those facts truths directly
shankara considered teachings vedas upanishads apta vacana valid source knowledge
suggests importance teacher-disciple relationship combining logic revelation attain moksha text upadeshasahasri
rambachan others state shankara methodology rely exclusively vedic statements included range logical methods reasoning methodology pramanas
similarities despite adi shankara's criticism certain schools mahayana buddhism shankara's philosophy shows strong similarities mahayana buddhist philosophy attacks
according s
dasgupta shankara followers borrowed much their dialectic form criticism buddhists
brahman very much like sunya nagarjuna [
debts shankara self-luminosity vijnanavada buddhism hardly overestimated
there seems much truth accusations against shankara vijnana bhiksu others hidden buddhist himself
am led think shankara's philosophy largely compound vijnanavada sunyavada buddhism upanisad notion permanence self superadded
according mudgal shankara's advaita buddhist madhyamaka view ultimate reality compatible because both transcendental indescribable non-dual arrived through via negativa neti neti
mudgal concludes therefore
difference sunyavada mahayana philosophy buddhism advaita philosophy hinduism may matter emphasis kind

benedict ashley credits adi shankara unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines hinduism namely atman brahman
isaeva states shankara's influence included reforming hinduism founding monasteries edifying disciples disputing opponents engaging philosophic activity eyes indian tradition help revive orthodox idea unity beings vedanta thought
prior shankara views similar already existed occupy dominant position within vedanta
nakamura states early vedanta scholars upper classes society well-educated traditional culture
formed social elite sharply distinguished general practitioners theologians hinduism
their teachings transmitted among small number selected intellectuals
works early vedanta schools contain references vishnu shiva
after shankara theologians various sects hinduism utilized vedanta philosophy greater lesser degree form basis their doctrines while nath-tradition established led theoretical influence upon whole indian society became final definitive
critical assessment scholars doubt shankara's early influence india
buddhist scholar richard e
king states although common find western scholars hindus arguing sankaracarya most influential important figure history hindu intellectual thought does seem justified historical evidence
according king roodurmun until 10 th century shankara overshadowed older contemporary mandana-misra latter considered major representative advaita
other scholars state historical records period unclear little reliable information known various contemporaries disciples shankara
example advaita tradition holds mandana-misra same person suresvara name adopted after became disciple shankara after public debate shankara won
scholars state maṇḍana-miśra sureśvara must two different scholars because their scholarship quite different
other scholars other hand state mandana-miśra shankara share views because both emphasize brahman-atman directly perceived rather discovered defined through elimination division duality any kind
self-realization soul-knowledge suggest both mandanamisra shankara described cataphatically positive liberation freedom through knowledge jivanmukti moksha well apophatically removal ignorance negation duality negation division people souls spirit-matter
while both share core premises states isaeva differ several ways mandanamisra holding vedic knowledge absolute end itself while shankara holds vedic knowledge religious rites subsidiary means human longing liberation freedom moksha
several scholars suggest historical fame cultural influence shankara grew centuries later particularly during era muslim invasions consequent devastation india
many shankara's biographies created published after 14 th century such widely cited vidyaranya's śankara-vijaya
vidyaranya also known madhava 12 th jagadguru śringeri śarada pītham 1380 1386 inspired re-creation hindu vijayanagara empire south india response devastation caused islamic delhi sultanate
brothers suggest paul hacker other scholars śankara well extensive advaitic commentaries vedas dharma
vidyaranya minister vijayanagara empire enjoyed royal support sponsorship methodical efforts helped establish shankara rallying symbol values helped spread historical cultural influence shankara's vedanta philosophies
vidyaranya also helped establish monasteries mathas expand cultural influence shankara

shankara ?
lokayatikas bauddhas assert soul does exist

sautranticas affirm actual existence external objects no less internal sensations 4
vaibhashikas agree later sautranticas except contend immediate apprehension exterior objects through images forms represented intellect
shcherbatsky shankara accuses them disregarding logic refuses enter controversy them
position shankara interesting because heart full agreement madhyamikas least main lines since both maintain reality one-without-a-second mirage manifold
shankara ardent hater budhism never confess
therefore treats madhyamika great contempt [
charge madhyamika denies possibility cognizing absolute logical methods pramana
vachaspati mishra bhamati rightly interprets point referring opinion madhyamikas logic incapable solve question existence non-existence really
opinion shankara himself well known shares
does accept authority logic means cognizing absolute deems privilege vedantin fare without logic since revelation fall back upon
opponents requires strict logical methods
