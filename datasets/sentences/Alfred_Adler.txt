adler died heart attack 1937 aberdeen scotland during lecture tour although cremains went missing unaccounted until 2007
death temporary blow influence ideas although number them subsequently taken up neo-freudians
through work rudolf dreikurs united states many other adherents worldwide adlerian ideas approaches remain strong viable 70 years after adler's death
around world there various organizations promoting adler's orientation towards mental social well-being
these include international committee adlerian summer schools institutes icassi north american society adlerian psychology nasap international association individual psychology
teaching institutes programs exist austria canada england germany greece israel italy japan latvia switzerland united states jamaica peru wales
basic principles adler influenced mental construct ideas philosopher hans vaihinger philosophy 'as if' literature dostoevsky
while still member vienna psychoanalytic society developed theory organic inferiority compensation prototype later turn phenomenology development famous concept inferiority complex
adler also influenced philosophies immanuel kant friedrich nietzsche rudolf virchow statesman jan smuts coined term holism
adler's school known individual psychology—an arcane reference latin individuus meaning indivisibility term intended emphasize holism—is both social community psychology well depth psychology
adler early advocate psychology prevention emphasized training parents teachers social workers democratic approaches allow child exercise their power through reasoned decision making whilst co-operating others
social idealist known socialist early years association psychoanalysis 1902–1911
adler pragmatic believed lay people make practical use insights psychology
adler also early supporter feminism psychology social world believing feelings superiority inferiority often gendered expressed symptomatically characteristic masculine feminine styles
these styles form basis psychic compensation lead mental health difficulties
adler also spoke safeguarding tendencies neurotic behavior long before anna freud same phenomena her book ego mechanisms defense
adlerian-based scholarly clinical social practices focus following topics[citation needed] social interest community feeling holism creative self fictional finalism teleology goal constructs psychological social encouragement inferiority superiority compensation life style/style life early recollections projective technique family constellation birth order life tasks social embeddedness conscious unconscious realms private logic common sense based part kant's sensus communis symptoms neurosis safeguarding behaviour guilt guilt feelings socratic questioning dream interpretation child adolescent psychology democratic approaches parenting families adlerian approaches classroom management leadership organisational psychology inception adlerian psychology included both professional lay adherents
adler felt people make use scientific insights garnered psychology welcomed everyone decorated academics those no formal education participate spreading principles adlerian psychology
[citation needed] adler's approach personality adler's book über den nervösen charakter neurotic character defines earlier key ideas
argued human personality explained teleologically parts individual's unconscious self ideally work convert feelings inferiority superiority rather completeness
desires self ideal countered social ethical demands
corrective factors disregarded individual overcompensated then inferiority complex occur fostering danger individual becoming egocentric power-hungry aggressive worse
common therapeutic tools include use humor historical instances paradoxical injunctions
psychodynamics teleology adler maintained human psychology psychodynamic nature
unlike freud's metapsychology emphasizes instinctual demands human psychology guided goals fueled yet unknown creative force
like freud's instincts adler's fictive goals largely unconscious
these goals teleological function
constructivist adlerians influenced neo-kantian nietzschean ideas view these teleological goals fictions sense hans vaihinger spoke fictio
usually there fictional final goal deciphered alongside innumerable sub-goals
inferiority/superiority dynamic constantly work through various forms compensation overcompensation
example anorexia nervosa fictive final goal perfectly thin overcompensation basis feeling inferiority
hence fictive final goal serve persecutory function ever-present subjectivity though trace springs usually unconscious
end goal being thin fictive however since never subjectively achieved
teleology serves another vital function adlerians
chilon's hora telos see end consider consequences provides both healthy maladaptive psychodynamics
here also find adler's emphasis personal responsibility mentally healthy subjects seek their own social good
constructivism metaphysics metaphysical thread adlerian theory does problematise notion teleology since concepts such eternity ungraspable end time ceases exist match religious aspects held tandem
contrast constructivist adlerian threads either humanist/modernist postmodern variant seek raise insight force unconscious fictions– carry inevitability 'fate'– long does understand them
here 'teleology' itself fictive yet experienced quite real
aspect adler's theory somewhat analogous principles developed rational emotive behavior therapy rebt cognitive therapy ct
both albert ellis aaron t
beck credit adler major precursor rebt ct
ellis particular member north american society adlerian psychology served editorial board member adlerian journal individual psychology
psychodynamic system adlerians excavate past client/patient order alter their future increase integration community 'here-and-now'
'here-and-now' aspects especially relevant those adlerians emphasize humanism and/or existentialism their approaches
holism metaphysical adlerians emphasise spiritual holism keeping jan smuts articulated smuts coined term holism spiritual sense one-ness holism usually implies etymology holism ὅλος holos greek word meaning entire total smuts believed evolution involves progressive series lesser wholes integrating larger ones
whilst smuts' text holism evolution thought work science actually attempts unify evolution higher metaphysical principle holism
sense connection one-ness revered various religious traditions among these baha'i christianity judaism islam buddhism finds strong complement adler's thought
[citation needed] pragmatic materialist aspects contextualizing members communities construction communities socio-historical-political forces shape communities matter great deal comes understanding individual's psychological make-up functioning
aspect adlerian psychology holds high level synergy field community psychology especially given adler's concern called absolute truth logic communal life
however adlerian psychology unlike community psychology holistically concerned both prevention clinical treatment after-the-fact
hence adler considered first community psychologist discourse formalized decades following adler's death king & shelley 2008
adlerian psychology carl jung's analytical psychology gestalt therapy karen horney's psychodynamic approach holistic schools psychology
these discourses eschew reductive approach understanding human psychology psychopathology
[citation needed] typology adler developed scheme so-called personality types however taken provisional heuristic since essence believe personality types different times proposed different equally tentative systems
danger typology lose sight individual's uniqueness gaze reductively acts adler opposed
nevertheless intended illustrate patterns denote characteristic governed under overall style life
hence american adlerians such harold mosak made use adler's typology provisional sense getting leaning sensitive people developed shell around themselves protects them must rely others carry them through life's difficulties
low energy levels become dependent
overwhelmed develop typically think neurotic symptoms phobias obsessions compulsions general anxiety hysteria amnesias depending individual details their lifestyle
avoiding types those hate being defeated
may successful taken any risks getting there
likely low social contact fear rejection defeat any way
ruling dominant type strive power willing manipulate situations people anything get their way
people type also prone anti-social behavior
socially useful types those very outgoing very active
lot social contact strive make changes good
these 'types' typically formed childhood expressions style life
importance memories adler placed great emphasis upon interpretation early memories working patients school children writing “among psychic expressions most revealing individual’s memories
adler viewed memories expressions “private logic” metaphors individual’s personal philosophy life “lifestyle
maintained memories never incidental trivial rather chosen reminders “a person’s memories reminders she carries her her limitations meanings events
there no “chance” memories
out incalculable number impressions individual receives she chooses remember those she considers however dimly bearing her problems
birth order adler often emphasized one's birth order having influence style life strengths weaknesses one's psychological make up
birth order referred placement siblings within family
adler believed firstborn child favorable position enjoying full attention eager new parents until arrival second child
second child cause first born suffer feelings dethronement no longer being center attention
adler 1908 believed three-child family oldest child most likely suffer neuroticism substance addiction reasoned compensation feelings excessive responsibility weight world one's shoulders e
having look after younger ones melancholic loss once supremely pampered position
result predicted child most likely end up jail asylum
youngest children tend overindulged leading poor social empathy
consequently middle child experience neither dethronement nor overindulgence most likely develop successful individual yet also most likely rebel feel squeezed-out
adler himself second family six children
adler never produced any scientific support interpretations birth order roles nor feel need
yet value hypothesis extend importance siblings marking psychology individual beyond freud's limited emphasis mother father
hence adlerians spend time therapeutically mapping influence siblings lack thereof psychology their clients
idiographic approach entails excavation phenomenology one's birth order position likely influence subject's style life
sum subjective experiences sibling positionality inter-relations psychodynamically important adlerian therapists personality theorists cookbook predictions may may objectively true adler's time
adler birth order answered question why children raised same family grow up very different personalities? while geneticist claim differences caused subtle variations individuals' genetics adler showed through birth order theory children grow up same family oldest child grows up family younger siblings middle child older younger siblings youngest older siblings
position family constellation adler reason these differences personality genetics point later taken up eric berne
addiction adler's insight birth order compensation issues relating individuals' perception community also led investigate causes treatment substance abuse disorders particularly alcoholism morphinism already serious social problems time
adler's work addicts significant since most other prominent proponents psychoanalysis invested relatively little time thought widespread ill modern post-modern age
addition applying individual psychology approach organ inferiority example onset causes addictive behaviours also tried find clear relationship drug cravings sexual gratification their substitutions
early pharmaco-therapeutic interventions non-addictive substances such neuphyllin used since withdrawal symptoms explained form water-poisoning made use diuretics necessary
adler wife's pragmatic approach seemingly high success rates their treatment based their ideas social functioning well-being
clearly life style choices situations emphasized example need relaxation negative effects early childhood conflicts examined compared other authoritarian religious treatment regimens clearly modern approaches
certainly observations example psychopaths likely drug addicts compatible current methodologies theories substance abuse treatment self-centred attributes illness clear escapism social responsibilities pathological addicts put adler's treatment modalities clearly modern contextual reasoning
homosexuality further information homosexuality psychology adler's ideas regarding non-heterosexual sexuality various social forms deviance long controversial
along prostitution criminality adler classified 'homosexuals' falling among failures life
1917 began writings homosexuality 52-page brochure sporadically published thoughts throughout rest life
dutch psychiatrist gerard j
van den aardweg underlines how alfred adler came conclusions 1917 adler believed established connection homosexuality inferiority complex towards one's own gender
point view differed freud's theory homosexuality rooted narcissism jung's view expressions contrasexuality vis-à-vis archetypes anima animus
there evidence adler may moved towards abandoning hypothesis
towards end adler's life mid-1930 s opinion towards homosexuality began shift
elizabeth h
mc dowell new york state family social worker recalls undertaking supervision adler young man living sin older man new york city
adler asked her happy you say? oh yes mc dowell replied
adler then stated well why don't leave alone
reflection mc dowell found comment contain profound wisdom there must misunderstanding adler's answer
adler offering help those asking person
therapy process applied those felt themselves deadlock fallen bottom well looking help get out
homosexuality considered most difficult cases needing long experience part psychotherapist many consequent sessions much personal work individual depending maturity problem
success guaranteed
according phyllis bottome adler's biography after adler himself laid upon her task homosexuality treated lack courage
these ways obtaining slight release physical need while avoiding greater obligation
transient partner your own sex better known road requires less courage permanent contact unknown sex
adler taught men cannot judged within their possessions used call nerves glands traumas drives et cetera since both judge prisoner liable misconstrue invisible incalculable judged no danger introspection how measures up three common life tasks set before every human being cradle grave
work employment love marriage social contact
parent education adler emphasized both treatment prevention
psychodynamic psychology adlerians emphasize foundational importance childhood developing personality any tendency towards various forms psychopathology
best way inoculate against now termed personality disorders adler called neurotic character tendency various neurotic conditions depression anxiety etc
train child feel equal part family
responsibility optimal development child limited mother father teachers society broadly
adler argued therefore teachers nurses social workers require training parent education complement work family fostering democratic character
child does feel equal enacted upon abused through pampering neglect likely develop inferiority superiority complexes various accompanying compensation strategies
these strategies exact social toll seeding higher divorce rates breakdown family criminal tendencies subjective suffering various guises psychopathology
adlerians long promoted parent education groups especially those influenced famous austrian/american adlerian rudolf dreikurs dreikurs & soltz 1964
spirituality ecology community late work social interest challenge mankind 1938 adler turns subject metaphysics integrates jan smuts' evolutionary holism ideas teleology community sub specie aeternitatis
unabashedly argues vision society social feeling means above struggle communal form must thought eternally applicable
humanity attained goal perfection
ideal society amongst mankind ultimate fulfillment evolution
adler follows pronouncement defense metaphysics see no reason afraid metaphysics great influence human life development
blessed possession absolute truth account compelled form theories ourselves our future results our actions etc
our idea social feeling final form humanity - imagined state problems life solved our relations external world rightly adjusted - regulative ideal goal gives our direction
goal perfection must bear within goal ideal community because value life endures continues endure eternally product social feeling
social feeling adler gemeinschaftsgefühl community feeling whereby feels she belongs others also developed ecological connection nature plants animals crust earth cosmos whole sub specie aeternitatis
clearly adler himself little problem adopting metaphysical spiritual point view support theories
yet overall theoretical yield provides ample room dialectical humanist modernist postmodernist explain significance community ecology through differing lenses even adlerians fully considered how deeply divisive contradictory these three threads metaphysics modernism post modernism
