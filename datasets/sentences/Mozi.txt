schooled confucianism early years viewed confucianism being too fatalistic emphasizing too much elaborate celebrations funerals felt detrimental livelihood productivity common people
managed attract large following during lifetime rivaled confucius
followers—mostly technicians craftspeople—were organized disciplined order studied both mozi's philosophical technical writings
according accounts popular understanding mozi time hailed many greatest hero come henan
passion good people without concern personal gain even own life death
tireless contribution society praised many including confucius' disciple mencius
mencius jinxin chinese 孟子盡心 pinyin mengzi jinxin mozi believed love mankind

zhang tai yan terms moral virtue even confucius laozi cannot compare mozi
mozi travelled crisis zone another throughout ravaged landscape warring states trying dissuade rulers their plans conquest

chu court mozi engaged nine simulated war games gongshu ban chief military strategist chu overturned each stratagems
gongshu ban threatened death mozi informed king disciples already trained soldiers song fortification methods useless kill
chu king forced call off war
way back however soldiers song recognizing allow mozi enter their city spend night freezing rain
after episode also stopped state qi attacking state lu
taught defense city does depend fortification weaponry food supply also important keep talented people close put trust them
though mozi's school thought faded obscurity after warring states period studied again two millennia after death
almost nobody copied texts during last two thousand years there much difficulty deciphering them
result mohism became most difficult philosophy within hundred schools thoughts study
both republican revolutionaries 1911 communists saw surprisingly modern thinker stifled early chinese history

though mozi believe history necessarily progresses han fei zi shared latter's critique fate 命 mìng
mozi believed people capable changing their circumstances directing their own lives
applying their senses observing world judging objects events their causes their functions their historical bases
against fate part 3 three-prong method mozi recommended testing truth falsehood statements
students later expanded form school names
mozi tried replace considered long-entrenched chinese over-attachment family clan structures concept impartial caring universal love 兼愛 jiān ài
argued directly against confucians argued natural correct people care different people different degrees
mozi contrast argued people principle should care people equally notion philosophers other schools found absurd interpreted notion implying no special amount care duty towards one's parents family

one’s parents will treated others treats parents others
pursuing line argument mozi directly appealing idea enlightened self-interest social relations
also note fact mozi differentiated intention actuality thereby placing central importance will love even though practice may very well impossible bring benefit everyone
addition mozi argued benevolence comes human beings naturally fire turns upward water turns downward provided persons positions authority illustrate benevolence their own lives
differentiating ideas universal jian differential bie mozi universal comes righteousness while differential entails human effort
furthermore mozi’s basic argument concerning universal love asserts universal love supremely practical argument directed against those objected such love put practice
mozi also held belief power ghosts spirits although often thought worshipped them pragmatically
fact discussion ghosts spirits remarks even exist communal gatherings sake making sacrificial offering play role strengthening social bonds
furthermore mozi will heaven 天 tiān people should love another mutual love bring benefit
therefore everyone's interest love others love themselves
heaven should respected because failing subject punishment
mozi heaven amoral mystical nature taoists
rather benevolent moral force rewarded good punished evil
similar ways abrahamic religions mozi believed living things live realm ruled heaven heaven will independent higher will man
thus writes universal love way heaven since heaven nourishes sustains life without regard status
laws customs mozi mozi's ideal government advocated meritocracy based talent rather background also followed idea heaven

stanford sinologist david shepherd nivison cambridge history ancient china writes moral goods mohism interrelated basic wealth then reproduction people then production wealth
people plenty good filial kind unproblematically
contrast jeremy bentham mozi believe individual happiness important consequences state outweigh consequences individual actions
