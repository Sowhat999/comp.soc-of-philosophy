philosophy panaetius began new eclectic shaping stoic theory even among neoplatonists passed platonist
reason also assigned first place philosophy physics logic appears undertaken any original treatment latter
physics gave up stoic doctrine conflagration universe endeavoured simplify division faculties soul doubted reality divination
ethics recognised two-fold division virtue theoretical practical answering dianoietic ethical aristotle endeavoured bring ultimate object life nearer relation natural impulses show similes inseparability virtues pointed out recognition moral something striven after own sake leading fundamental idea speeches demosthenes admit harsh doctrine apatheia contrary vindicated claim certain pleasurable sensations regarded accordance nature while also insisted moral definitions should laid down such way might applied man yet attained wisdom
writings duties principal work panaetius without doubt treatise duties greek περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος composed three books
