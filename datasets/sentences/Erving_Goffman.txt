hughes most influential teachers according tom burns
gary alan fine philip manning state goffman never engaged serious dialogue other theorists
work however influenced discussed numerous contemporary sociologists including anthony giddens jürgen habermas pierre bourdieu
though goffman often associated symbolic interaction school sociological thought see himself representative fine manning conclude does easily fit within specific school sociological thought
ideas also difficult reduce number key themes work broadly described developing comparative qualitative sociology aimed produce generalizations human behavior
goffman made substantial advances study face-to-face interaction elaborated dramaturgical approach human interaction developed numerous concepts massive influence particularly field micro-sociology everyday life
many works concerned organization everyday behavior concept termed interaction order
contributed sociological concept framing frame analysis game theory concept strategic interaction study interactions linguistics
regard latter argued activity speaking must seen social rather linguistic construct
methodological perspective goffman often employed qualitative approaches specifically ethnography most famously study social aspects mental illness particular functioning total institutions
overall contributions valued attempt create theory bridges agency-and-structure divide popularizing social constructionism symbolic interaction conversation analysis ethnographic studies study importance individual interactions
influence extended far beyond sociology example work provided assumptions much current research language social interaction within discipline communication
impression management defined individual attempts present acceptable image those around her verbally nonverbally 480
definition based goffman’s idea individuals see themselves others view them essence attempt see themselves outside looking 480
goffman also dedicating work discover subtle ways humans present acceptable images concealing information may conflict images particular situation
instance concealing tattoos applying job tattoos inappropriate hiding bizarre obsession such collecting/interacting dolls society whole may see abnormal
goffman does break connection george herbert mead herbert blumer while does reject way individuals perceive themselves interested actual physical proximity “interaction order” molds self 481
other words goffman believed impression management achieved audience sync individual’s perception self
audience disagreement image individual presenting then individual’s presentation self interrupted
individuals present images themselves based how society thinks should act particular situation
decision how act decided based concept definition situation
definition predetermined individuals choose how will act choosing proper behavior social situation
goffman draws william thomas concept well
thomas believed people born particular social class definitions situations will encounter previously defined them 480
instance individual high class background goes black tie affair predefined definition situation must mind their manors act according their class
2007 goffman listed times higher education guide sixth most-cited author humanities social sciences behind anthony giddens ahead jürgen habermas
popularity general public attributed writing style described sardonic satiric jokey ironic self-consciously literary being accessible most academics
style also influential academia credited popularizing less formal style academic publications
students included carol brooks gardner charles goodwin marjorie goodwin john lofland gary marx harvey sacks emanuel schegloff david sudnow eviatar zerubavel
despite influence according fine manning there remarkably few scholars continuing work nor there goffman school thus impact social theory simultaneously great modest
fine manning attribute lack subsequent goffman-style research writing nature signature style consider very difficult duplicate even mimic-proof also writing style subjects being widely valued social sciences
regard style fine manning remark tends seen either scholar whose style difficult reproduce therefore daunting those might wish emulate style scholar whose work transitional bridging work chicago school contemporary sociologists thus less interest sociologists classics either those two groups
regard subjects fine manning observe topic behavior public places often stigmatized being trivial thus unworthy serious scholarly attention
nonetheless fine manning note goffman most influential american sociologist twentieth century

developed book's core ideas doctoral dissertation
goffman's first most famous book received american sociological association's 1961 mac iver award
goffman describes theatrical performances occur face-to-face interactions
holds individual comes contact another person attempts control guide impression other person will form altering own setting appearance manner
same time person individual interacting attempts form impression obtain information individual
goffman also believes participants social interactions engage certain practices avoid embarrassing themselves others
society homogeneous must act differently different settings
recognition led goffman dramaturgical analysis
saw connection kinds acts people put their daily lives theatrical performances
social interaction theatrical performance there onstage area actors individuals appear before audience positive self-concepts desired impressions offered
there well backstage hidden private area individuals themselves drop their societal roles identities
asylums main article asylums book goffman sometimes credited having 1957 coined term total institution though fine manning note heard lectures everett hughes reference any type institution people treated alike behavior regulated
regardless whether goffman coined term total institution popularized 1961 book asylums essays social situation mental patients other inmates
book described ethnography concept total institution
book first sociological examinations social situation mental patients psychiatric hospitals major contribution understanding social aspects mental illness
book composed four essays characteristics total institutions 1957 moral career mental patient 1959 underlife public institution study ways making out mental hospital medical model mental hospitalization notes vicissitudes tinkering trades
first three essays focus experiences patients last professional-client interactions
goffman mainly concerned details psychiatric hospitalization nature effects process calls institutionalization
describes how institutionalization socializes people role good patient someone dull harmless inconspicuous condition turn reinforces notions chronicity severe mental illness
total institutions greatly affect people's interactions yet even such places people find ways redefine their roles reclaim their identities
asylums credited helping catalyze reform mental health systems number countries leading reductions numbers large mental hospitals individuals locked up them
also influential anti-psychiatry movement
behavior public behavior public places 1963 goffman again focuses everyday public interactions
draws distinctions several types public gatherings gatherings situations social occasions types audiences acquainted versus unacquainted
stigma goffman's book stigma notes management spoiled identity 1963 examines how protect their identities depart approved standards behavior appearance people manage impressions themselves mainly through concealment
stigma pertains shame person may feel she fails meet other people's standards fear being discredited causes individual reveal her shortcomings
thus person criminal record may simply withhold information fear being judged whomever person happens encounter
interaction ritual interaction ritual essays face-to-face behavior collection six goffman essays
first four originally published 1950 s fifth 1964 last written collection
include face-work 1955 embarrassment social organization 1956 nature deference demeanor 1956 alienation interaction 1957 mental symptoms public order 1964 action
first essay face-work discusses concept face positive self-image individual holds interacting others
goffman believes face sociological construct interaction neither inherent nor permanent aspect person
once individual offers positive self-image herself others individual feels need maintain live up image
inconsistency how person projects herself society risks embarrassment discrediting
therefore people remain guarded ensure show themselves others unfavorable light
strategic interaction goffman's book strategic interaction 1969 contribution game theory
discusses compatibility game theory legacy chicago school sociology perspective symbolic interactionism
few works clearly engage perspective
goffman's view game theory shaped works thomas schelling
goffman presents reality form game discusses rules various moves players make unwitting naive covering uncovering counter-uncovering
frame analysis frame analysis essay organization experience 1974 goffman's attempt explain how conceptual frames ways organize experience structure individual's perception society
book thus organization experience rather organization society
frame set concepts theoretical perspectives organize experiences guide actions individuals groups societies
frame analysis then study organization social experience
illustrate concept frame goffman gives example picture frame person uses frame represents structure hold together picture represents content experiencing life
most basic frames called primary frameworks
primary framework takes individual's experience aspect scene originally meaningless makes meaningful
type primary framework natural framework identifies situations natural world completely biophysical no human influences
other type framework social framework explains events connects them humans
example natural framework weather example social framework meteorologist predicts weather
focusing social frameworks goffman seeks construct general statement regarding structure form experiences individuals any moment their social life
goffman saw book magnum opus popular earlier works
frame analyses talk frame analyses erving goffman provides platform understanding interpreting interaction individuals engaging speech communication
chapter “the frame analyses talk” focus put how words exchanged being specifically informal talk conversation
concept framing introduced through exploration why misunderstandings occur these basic everyday conversations
argues errors verbal framing anything else
types frames goffman considering discussed previous sections book “fabrications keyings frame breaks misframing course frame disputes
frame assume many forms basis analyses “these framings subject multitude different transformations - warrant frame analysis first place
goffman’s key idea most conversation simply replaying strip describes personal experience event
talk others speaker’s goal often same provide “evidence fairness unfairness current situation other grounds sympathy approval exoneration understanding amusement
listeners primarily obliged show kind audience appreciation
essentially through interaction looking heard inspire any kind action simply know someone listened understood
why often simple head nod grunt accepted appropriate response conversation
goffman explains way conversation keyed critical understanding intent behind many utterances everyday speech
key probably best understood tone dialogue change numerous times during interaction
signaling change key way framing often takes place “special brackets will introduced should want say something relatively serious way kidding aside now i'm really serious other such tags become necessary means momentarily down keying flow words
folklorist richard bauman builds heavily goffman’s work specifically idea key work pertaining analysis performance frame
bauman details performance dependent being properly keyed without display will successful
work performance analyses deeply indepted goffman establishes here “frame analyses
context other element framing essential
participants will bound norms good manners through frequency length turns talk through topics avoided through circumspection regard references self through attention offered eagerly begrudgingly-through these means rank social relationship will given their due
certain things will scenario never uttered another
awareness these social framings critical just awareness audience
depending you’re speaking teacher child loved friend pet etc
you will curve your speech fit frame your intended audience expecting
goffman uses metaphor conversation being stage play
plays tone will shift throughout performance due actions taken actors similar how discussion keyed based either person says does over course interaction key will change accordingly
parallels go further though
goffman also claims speaker details drama often provide information
invite listener empathize explained above they’re often meant stirred take action rather show appreciation during play generally takes form applause
other similarities include engaging suspense speaker attempting create
both scenarios you must put aside knowledge performers know outcome event being relayed sense play along
integral stance explains “the argument much talk consists replayings these make no sense unless form storyteller's suspense maintained shows close relevance frame-indeed close relevance dramaturgy-for organization talk
lastly because replaying strips extemporaneous rather preformulated yet another parallel stage production conversation
these things work concert provide foundation how talk framed
gender advertisements main article gender advertisement gender advertisements 1979 book part goffman's series studies anthropology visual communication deals topic gender representation advertising
book visual essay sex roles advertising differences depictions men women subtle underlying messages sexual roles projected masculine feminine images advertising well symbolism advertising
book goffman examined over 500 advertisements order find general patterns stereotypical gender representation placed six categories relative size goffman argues social situation expressed through relative size persons advertisements men showing their superiority through their girth height
feminine touch women frequently depicted touching persons objects ritualistic manner occasionally just barely touching object person
function ranking man woman shown collaborative manner male likely shown higher ranked person woman
family families depicted advertising parents shown closer their children same gender instances men shown separate rest family protective manner
ritualization subordination difference expressed lowering oneself physically
superiority disdain holding body erect head high
licensed withdrawal goffman states women advertisements frequently depicted removed scene around them either physically turning away scene appearing lost thought
her 2001 work measuring up how advertising affects self-image vickie rutledge shields stated work unique time employing method now being labeled 'semiotic content analysis' [provided] base textual analyses
such poststructuralist psychoanalytic approaches
she also noted feminist scholars like jean kilbourne [built] their highly persuasive widely circulated findings nature gender advertising goffman's original categories
forms talk goffman's book forms talk 1981 includes five essays replies responses 1976 response cries 1978 footing 1979 lecture 1976 radio talk 1981
