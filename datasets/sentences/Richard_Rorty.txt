during period especially popular once quipped assigned position transitory professor trendy studies
rorty's doctoral dissertation concept potentiality historical study concept completed under supervision paul weiss first book editor linguistic turn 1967 firmly prevailing analytic mode collecting classic essays linguistic turn analytic philosophy
however gradually became acquainted american philosophical movement known pragmatism particularly writings john dewey
noteworthy work being done analytic philosophers such willard van orman quine wilfrid sellars caused significant shifts thinking reflected next book philosophy mirror nature 1979
pragmatists generally hold meaning proposition determined use linguistic practice
rorty combined pragmatism truth other matters later wittgensteinian philosophy language declares meaning social-linguistic product sentences 'link up' world correspondence relation
rorty contingency irony solidarity 1989 truth cannot out there—cannot exist independently human mind—because sentences cannot exist out there
world out there descriptions world
descriptions world true false
world own unaided describing activities humans cannot
”5 views like led rorty question many philosophy's most basic assumptions—and also led being apprehended postmodern/deconstructionist philosopher
indeed late 1980 s through 1990 s rorty focused continental philosophical tradition examining works friederich nietzsche martin heidegger michel foucault jean-françois lyotard jacques derrida
work period included contingency irony solidarity essays heidegger others philosophical papers truth progress philosophical papers 1998
latter two works attempt bridge dichotomy analytic continental philosophy claiming two traditions complement rather oppose each other
according rorty analytic philosophy may lived up pretensions may solved puzzles thought
yet such philosophy process finding reasons putting those pretensions puzzles aside helped earn itself important place history ideas
giving up quest apodicticity finality edmund husserl shared rudolf carnap bertrand russell finding new reasons thinking such quest will never succeed analytic philosophy cleared path leads past scientism just german idealists cleared path led around empiricism
last fifteen years life rorty continued publish writings including four volumes archived philosophical papers achieving our country 1998 political manifesto partly based readings dewey walt whitman defended idea progressive pragmatic left against feels defeatist anti-liberal anti-humanist positions espoused critical left continental school
rorty felt these anti-humanist positions personified figures like nietzsche heidegger foucault
such theorists also guilty inverted platonism attempted craft overarching metaphysical sublime philosophies—which fact contradicted their core claims ironist contingent
rorty's last works after move stanford university focused place religion contemporary life liberal communities comparative literature philosophy cultural politics

concludes now wish spent somewhat my life verse
because fear having missed out truths incapable statement prose
there no such truths there nothing death swinburne landor knew epicurus heidegger failed grasp
rather because lived fully able rattle off old chestnuts—just made close friends

major works philosophy mirror nature main article philosophy mirror nature philosophy mirror nature 1979 rorty argues central problems modern epistemology depend upon picture mind trying faithfully represent mirror mind-independent external reality
give up metaphor then entire enterprise foundationalist epistemology misguided
foundationalist believes order avoid regress inherent claiming beliefs justified other beliefs beliefs must self-justifying form foundations knowledge
there two senses foundationalism criticized philosophy mirror nature
epistemological sense rorty criticized attempt justify knowledge claims tracing them set foundations e
self-evident premises noninferential sensations broadly criticized claim philosophy function foundationally within culture
former argument draws sellars's critique idea there given sensory perception combination quine's critique distinction analytic sentences sentences true solely virtue mean synthetic sentences sentences made true world
each critique taken alone provides problem conception how philosophy ought proceed yet leaves enough tradition intact proceed former aspirations
combined rorty claimed two critiques devastating
no privileged insight structure belief no privileged realm truths meaning instead knowledge those beliefs pay their way
worthwhile description actual process inquiry rorty claimed kuhnian account standard phases progress disciplines oscillating through normal abnormal periods routine problem-solving intellectual crises
after eliminating foundationalism rorty argues few roles left philosopher act intellectual gadfly attempting induce revolutionary break previous practice role rorty happy take himself
rorty suggests each generation tries subject disciplines model most successful discipline day employs
rorty's view success modern science led academics philosophy humanities mistakenly imitate scientific methods
philosophy mirror nature popularized extended ideas wilfrid sellars critique myth given willard van orman quine critique analytic-synthetic distinction others advocate wittgensteinian doctrine dissolving rather solving philosophical problems
contingency irony solidarity main article contingency irony solidarity contingency irony solidarity 1989 rorty abandons specifically analytic modes explication favor narrative pastiche order develop alternative conceptual vocabulary platonists rejects
schema based belief there no worthwhile theory truth aside boring non-epistemic semantic donald davidson developed out work alfred tarski
rorty suggests task philosophy should distinguished along public private lines
private philosophers provide greater abilities recreate oneself view adapted nietzsche rorty also identifies novels marcel proust vladimir nabokov should expected help public problems
public philosophy might turn rawls habermas
book also marks first attempt specifically articulate political vision consistent philosophy vision diverse community bound together opposition cruelty abstract ideas such 'justice' 'common humanity' policed separation public private realms life
book rorty introduces terminology ironism uses describe mindset philosophy
objectivity relativism truth amongst essays objectivity relativism truth philosophical papers volume 1990 priority democracy philosophy rorty defends rawls against communitarian critics
rorty argues liberalism get along without philosophical presuppositions while same time conceding communitarians conception self makes community constitutive self does comport well liberal democracy
rorty social institutions ought thought experiments cooperation rather attempts embody universal ahistorical order
essays heidegger others text rorty focuses primarily continental philosophers heidegger derrida
argues these european post-nietzscheans share much american pragmatists critique metaphysics reject correspondence theory truth
discussing derrida rorty claims derrida most useful viewed funny writer attempted circumvent western philosophical tradition rather inventor philosophical literary method
vein rorty criticizes derrida's followers like paul de man taking deconstructive literary theory too seriously
achieving our country main article achieving our country achieving our country leftist thought twentieth-century america 1997 rorty differentiates sees two sides left cultural left progressive left
criticizes cultural left exemplified post-structuralists such foucault postmodernists such lyotard offering critiques society no alternatives alternatives vague general abdications
although these intellectuals make insightful claims ills society rorty suggests provide no alternatives even occasionally deny possibility progress
other hand progressive left exemplified rorty pragmatist dewey whitman james baldwin makes hope better future priority
without hope rorty argues change spiritually inconceivable cultural left begun breed cynicism
rorty sees progressive left acting philosophical spirit pragmatism
human rights rorty's notion human rights grounded notion sentimentality
contended throughout history humans devised various means construing certain groups individuals inhuman subhuman
thinking rationalist foundationalist terms will solve problem claimed
rorty advocated creation culture global human rights order stop violations happening through sentimental education
argued should create sense empathy teach empathy others understand others' suffering
reception criticism rorty among most widely discussed controversial contemporary philosophers works provoked thoughtful responses many well-respected philosophers
robert brandom's anthology entitled rorty critics example rorty's philosophy discussed donald davidson jürgen habermas hilary putnam john mc dowell jacques bouveresse daniel dennett among others
2007 roger scruton rorty paramount among those thinkers advance their own opinion immune criticism pretending truth consensus counts while defining consensus terms people like themselves
john mc dowell strongly influenced rorty particularly rorty's philosophy mirror nature 1979
continental philosophy authors such jürgen habermas gianni vattimo jacques derrida albrecht wellmer hans joas chantal mouffe simon critchley esa saarinen mike sandbothe influenced different ways rorty's thinking
american novelist david foster wallace titled short story collection oblivion stories philosophy mirror nature critics accredited rorty's influence wallace's writings irony
susan haack fierce critic rorty's neopragmatism
haack criticises rorty's claim pragmatist short play called pragmatists rorty charles sanders peirce fictional conversation using accurate quotes their own writing
haack link rorty's neopragmatism pragmatism peirce name
haack believes rorty's neopragmatism both anti-philosophical anti-intellectual exposes people further rhetorical manipulation
although rorty confirmed liberal political moral philosophies attacked commentators left whom believe them insufficient frameworks social justice
rorty also criticized others rejection idea science depict world
criticism especially contingency irony solidarity rorty's philosophical 'hero' ironist elitist figure
rorty claims majority people commonsensically nominalist historicist ironist
these people combine ongoing attention particular opposed transcendent nominalism awareness their place continuum contingent lived experience alongside other individuals historicist without necessarily having continual doubts resulting worldview ironist does
ironist someone radical continuing doubts their final vocabulary 2 realizes argument phrased their vocabulary neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts 3 does think their vocabulary closer reality others 73 contingency irony solidarity
other hand italian philosopher gianni vattimo alongside spanish philosopher santiago zabala their 2011 book hermeneutic communism heidegger marx affirm together richard rorty also consider flaw `the main thing contemporary academic marxists inherit marx engels conviction quest cooperative commonwealth should scientific rather utopian knowing rather romantic
′ will show hermeneutics contains utopian romantic features rorty refers because contrary knowledge science does claim modern universality rather postmodern particularism
rorty often draws broad range other philosophers support views interpretation their works contested
since rorty working tradition re-interpretation remains uninterested 'accurately' portraying other thinkers rather utilizing their work same way literary critic might use novel
essay historiography philosophy four genres thorough description how treats greats history philosophy
contingency irony solidarity rorty attempts disarm those criticize writings arguing their philosophical criticisms made using axioms explicitly rejected within rorty's own philosophy
instance rorty defines allegations irrationality affirmations vernacular otherness so—rorty claims—accusations irrationality expected during any argument must simply brushed aside
