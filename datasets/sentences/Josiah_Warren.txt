philosophy warren like proudhon chose path anarchism individualism
benjamin tucker dedicated collection essays instead book memory warren my friend master
whose teachings my first source light
tucker credits warren being first man expound formulate doctrine now known anarchism
john stuart mill warren's philosophy though being superficial resemblance project socialists diametrically opposed them principle since recognizes no authority whatever society over individual except enforce equal freedom development individuals
warren's principle sovereignty individual later taken up mill herbert spencer
warren's individualistic philosophy arose out rejection robert owen's cooperative movement early participant witnessing person failure owen's new harmony commune
seemed difference opinion tastes purposes increased just proportion demand conformity […] appeared nature's own inherent law diversity conquered us […] our 'united interests' directly war individualities persons circumstances instinct self-preservation
according warren there should absolutely no community property property should individualized those advocated any type communism connected property interests responsibilities doomed failure because individuality persons involved such experiment
warren notable expounding idea sovereignty individual
manifesto josiah warren writes [t]he forming societies any other artificial combinations first greatest most fatal mistake ever committed legislators reformers
these combinations require surrender natural sovereignty individual over her person time property responsibilities government combination
tends prostrate individual—to reduce mere piece machine involving others responsibility acts being involved responsibilities acts sentiments associates lives & acts without proper control over own affairs without certainty results actions almost without brains dares use own account consequently never realizes great objects society professedly formed
ethics pricing sample labor labor note cincinnati time store
scanned equitable commerce 1846 josiah warren josiah warren termed phrase cost limit price cost here referring monetary price paid labor exerted produce item
understanding cost congruent classical economist adam smith real price every thing every thing really costs man wants acquire toil trouble acquiring though warren reached different conclusions
believed goods services should trade according how much labor exerted produce them bring them market instead according how individuals believed them subjectively worth
therefore proposed system pay people certificates indicating how many hours work
exchange notes local time stores goods took same amount time produce
charge labor something entailed less labor cannibalism according
moreover believed trading according cost limit price promote increasing efficiency economy explains equitable commerce cost made limit price every becomes interested reducing cost bringing economies facilities their aid
contrary cost does govern price every thing priced will bring there no such co-operating interests
am my supply flour cost then any facility afford wheat grower reduces cost me does same any portion wheat am promoting their interests while pursuing my own…now wheat sold us cost whatever bring according our necessities then none us any interest affording facilities repairing breaches nor any other way co-operating producer
same motive act production preservation use every thing
