anselm's works considered philosophical well theological since endeavor render christian tenets faith traditionally taken revealed truth rational system
anselm also studiously analyzed language used subjects carefully distinguishing meaning terms employed verbal forms found times wholly inadequate
worldview broadly neoplatonic reconciled christianity works st augustine pseudo-dionysius[n 3] understanding aristotelian logic gathered works boethius
thinkers northern france shortly followed him—including abelard william conches gilbert poitiers—inaugurated most brilliant periods western philosophy innovating logic semantics ethics metaphysics other areas philosophical theology
anselm held faith necessarily precedes reason reason expand upon faith seek understand may believe believe might understand
too believe since unless first believe shall understand
[n 4] possibly drawn tractate xxix st augustine's ten homilies first epistle john regarding john 714–18 augustine counseled seek understand order believe believe thou may understand
anselm rephrased idea repeatedly[n 5] williams considered aptest motto original title proslogion faith seeking understanding intended active love god seeking deeper knowledge god
once faith held fast however argued attempt must made demonstrate truth means reason me seems negligence after confirmation faith study understand believe

stylistically anselm's treatises take two basic forms dialogues sustained meditations

follows st augustine such extent gibson argues neither boethius nor anselm state anything already dealt greater detail augustine's de trinitate anselm even acknowledges debt work monologion’s prologue
however takes pains present reasons belief god without appeal scriptural patristic authority using new bold arguments
attributes style—and book's existence—to requests fellow monks nothing whatsoever these matters should made convincing authority scripture whatsoever
necessity reason concisely prove
first chapter anselm begins statement anyone should able convince themselves existence god through reason alone even moderately intelligent
argues many different things known good many varying kinds degrees
these must understood being judged relative single attribute goodness
then argues goodness itself very good further good through itself
such must highest good further supremely good also supremely great
there therefore thing supremely good supremely great—in other words supreme among existing things
chapter 2 follows similar argument while chapter 3 argues best greatest supreme among existing things must responsible existence other things
chapter 4 argues there must highest level dignity among existing things highest level must single member
therefore there certain nature substance essence through himself good great through himself through whom exists whatever truly good great anything supreme good supreme great thing supreme being subsistent supreme among existing things

written form extended direct address god
grew out dissatisfaction monologion's interlinking contingent arguments
single argument needed nothing itself alone proof itself enough show god really exists commonly[n 10] taken merely second chapter work
anselm reasoned even atheists imagine greatest being having such attributes nothing greater exist id quo nihil maius cogitari possit
however such being's attributes include existence still greater being imagined attributes first existence
therefore truly greatest possible being must necessarily exist
further necessarily-existing greatest being must god therefore necessarily exists
reasoning known scholastics anselm's argument ratio anselmi became known ontological argument existence god following kant's treatment

anselm addresses question-begging nature greatness formula partially appeal intuition partially independent consideration attributes being examined

responsio argument presented proslogion rarely seemed satisfactory[n 12] swiftly opposed gaunilo monk abbey marmoutier tours
book fool liber pro insipiente[n 13] argues cannot arbitrarily pass idea reality de posse ad esse fit illatio
most devastating gaunilo's objections parody anselm's argument involving island greater nothing conceived
since conceive such island exists our understanding and—following anselm—must exist reality
however absurd since shore might arbitrarily increased any case varies tide
anselm's reply responsio apology liber apologeticus does address argument directly led klima grzesik others construct replies led wolterstorff others conclude gaunilo's attack definitive
anselm however considered gaunilo misunderstood argument
each gaunilo's four arguments takes anselm's description nothing greater thought equivalent greater everything else thought
anselm countered anything does actually exist necessarily excluded reasoning anything might probably does exist likewise aside point
proslogion already stated anything else whatsoever other [god] thought exist
proslogion’s argument concerns concern single greatest entity out existing things
entity both must exist must god

anselm's de grammatico grammarian uncertain date[n 14] deals eliminating various paradoxes arising grammar latin nouns adjectives examining syllogisms involved ensure terms premises agree meaning merely expression
treatment shows clear debt boethius's treatment aristotle
1080 1086 while still bec anselm composed dialogues de veritate truth de libertate arbitrii freedom choice de casu diaboli devil's fall
de veritate concerned merely truth statements correctness will action essence well
correctness such matters understood doing thing ought designed
anselm employs aristotelian logic affirm existence absolute truth other truth forms separate kinds
identifies absolute truth god therefore forms fundamental principle both existence things correctness thought
corollary affirms everything rightly
de libertate arbitrii elaborates anselm's reasoning correctness regard free will
does consider capacity 'sin capacity good own sake opposed owing coercion self-interest
god good angels therefore free will despite being incapable sinning similarly non-coercive aspect free will enabled man rebel angels sin despite being necessary element free will itself
de casu diaboli anselm further considers case fallen angels serves discuss case rational agents general
teacher argues there two forms good—justice justicia benefit commodum—and two forms evil injustice harm incommodum
rational beings seek benefit shun harm their own account independent choice permits them abandon bounds imposed justice
angels chose their own happiness preference justice punished god their injustice less happiness
angels upheld justice rewarded such happiness now incapable sin there being no happiness left them seek opposition bounds justice
humans meanwhile retain theoretical capacity will justly owing fall incapable doing practice except divine grace

anselm argues owing fall mankind's fallen nature ever since humanity offended god
divine justice demands restitution sin human beings incapable providing actions men already obligated furtherance god's glory
further god's infinite justice demands infinite restitution impairment infinite dignity
enormity offense led anselm reject personal acts atonement even peter damian's flagellation inadequate ultimately vain
instead full recompense made god infinite mercy inclines provide
atonement humanity however made through figure jesus sinless being both fully divine fully human
taking upon himself offer own life our behalf crucifixion accrues infinite worth redeeming mankind permitting enjoy just will accord intended nature
interpretation notable permitting divine justice mercy entirely compatible exercised immense influence over church doctrine largely supplanting earlier theory developed origen gregory nyssa focused primarily satan's power over fallen man
