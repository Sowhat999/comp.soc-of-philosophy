crisis house divided crisis house divided harry v
jaffa crisis house divided jaffa discusses lincoln-douglas debates occurred eve american civil war
during 1850 s concern over spread slavery territories free states became primary concern american politics
douglas proposed doctrine popular sovereignty removed congressional authority over slavery's expansion territories allowed citizens each territory decide whether slavery legal there
contrast lincoln believed popular sovereignty another example tyranny majority
lincoln argued majority sanction enslavement other men due founding principle men created equal slavery violated
both men squared off contest illinois' senate seat 1858
book jaffa explains philosophical underpinnings both lincoln douglas' arguments
according catherine h
zuckert jaffa aimed nothing less bringing bear america methods substance straussian revival socratic tradition political philosophy
like strauss jaffa observed tendency modernity degenerate moral political philosophy found douglas' appeal popular sovereignty
jaffa also believed lincoln challenged douglas' argument aristotelian classical philosophical position derived declaration independence contention men created equal
new birth freedom new birth freedom first projected two-volume commentary gettysburg address
first volume focuses lincoln's first inaugural address july 4 1861 address congress
jaffa argues gettysburg address self-contained work speech within drama

bradford willmoore kendall
most recently jaffa debated libertarian author thomas di lorenzo
debate thomas di lorenzo jaffa thomas di lorenzo debated each other may 7 2002 event hosted independent institute
each man made statement followed rebuttal other ending questions answers audience
jaffa's argument divided four sections south closed society 1860 presidential election 10 states became confederate states lincoln ballot denying least 100000 votes those later went north join union army possibly
jaffa points out cooper union address lincoln concluded south satisfied anti-slavery sentiment removed state constitutions eight free states laws preventing free blacks being kidnapped slaves
man accused being slave summon no witnesses no counsel
jaffa federal commissioner decided slave [the commissioner] paid $10 decided free man paid $5
it's hard imagine any law passed either nazi germany stalin's russia inconsistent principles civil liberty fugitive slave act
right secession right revolution jaffa distinguished revolution secession
revolution argues explained under declaration independence
states “whenever any form government becomes destructive these ends [the security life liberty pursuit happiness] people right alter abolish institute new government [such] them shall seem most likely effect their safety happiness
contrast confederacy claimed right secession confederacy believed such right existed under constitution
jaffa argues confederacy claimed secession instead revolution because rights being violated federal government
however also notes states ratified constitution also agreed adhere results elections seceding union confederacy violated basic promise
prelude southern secession jaffa believed initial act secession took place 1860 democratic convention
according seven states deep south same seven states seceded after lincoln's election before inauguration demanded plank democratic platform without support douglas slave code territories
convention refused grant demand delegates seven states left convention
section debate jaffa points out slavery aggressively expanding repeal missouri compromise kansas-nebraska act
also dred scott case allowed slave owners take slaves territories demand federal government protection slavery those areas
jaffa claims largest expansions federal power
lincoln-douglas debates jaffa argued douglas accepted dred scott decision
there chief justice taney right own slaves expressly affirmed constitution
however lincoln debates implied expressly affirmed
lincoln douglas accepting taney's opinion slavery expressly affirmed constitution under obligation give slave owners implementation right
possibilities expansion slavery almost endless according jaffa
because douglas subscribe slave code south left party enough elect abraham lincoln
criticism robert bork jaffa argues former supreme court nominee robert bork advances theory american constitutionalism fundamental tension principles declaration independence
according bork believes constitution declaration separate documents never intended inform another
jaffa argues bork's argument represents legal positivism moral relativism akin expressed john c
calhoun confederacy during civil war

jaffa spent lifetime stressing importance declaration conservatives liberals alike
