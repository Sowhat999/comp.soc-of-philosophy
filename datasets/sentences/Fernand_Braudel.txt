braudel there no single mediterranean sea
there many seas—indeed vast complex expanse within men operate
life conducted mediterranean people travel fish fight wars drown various contexts
sea articulates plains islands
life plains diverse complex poorer south affected religious diversity catholicism islam well intrusions both cultural economic wealthier north
other words mediterranean cannot understood independently exterior
any rigid adherence boundaries falsifies situation
first level time geographical time environment slow almost imperceptible change repetition cycles
such change may slow irresistible
second level time comprises long-term social economic cultural history braudel discusses mediterranean economy social groupings empires civilizations
change level much rapid environment braudel looks two three centuries order spot particular pattern such rise fall various aristocracies
third level time events histoire événementielle
history individuals names
braudel time surfaces deceptive effects
time courte durée proper focus part 3 mediterranean treats events politics people
braudel's mediterranean centered sea just important also desert mountains
desert creates nomadic form social organization whole community moves mountain life sedentary
transhumance — movement mountain plain vice versa given season — also persistent part mediterranean existence
braudel's vast panoramic view used insights other social sciences employed concept longue durée downplayed importance specific events
widely admired most historians try replicate instead focused their specialized monographs
book firmly launched study mediterranean dramatically raised worldwide profile annales school

final three-volume work appeared 1979
work broad-scale history preindustrial modern world presented minute detail demanded school called cliometrics focusing how people made economies work
like major works mixed traditional economic material thick description social impact economic events various facets everyday life such food fashion other social customs
braudel discussed idea long-term cycles capitalist economy saw developing europe 12 th century
particular cities later nation-states follow each other sequentially centers these cycles venice genoa 13 th through 15 th centuries 1250–1510 antwerp 16 th century 1500–1569 amsterdam 16 th through 18 th centuries 1570–1733 london england 18 th 19 th centuries 1733–1896
used word structures denote variety social structures such organized behaviours attitudes conventions well physical structures infrastructures
argued structures established europe during middle ages contributed successes present-day european-based cultures
attributed much long-standing independence city-states though later subjugated larger geographic states completely suppressed—probably reasons utility
braudel argued capitalists typically monopolists usually assumed entrepreneurs operating competitive markets
argued capitalists specialize use free markets thus diverging both liberal adam smith marxian interpretations
braudel's view state capitalist countries served guarantor monopolists rather protector competition usually portrayed
asserted capitalists power cunning their side arrayed themselves against majority population
should noted agrarian structure long-term structure braudelian understanding concept
larger scale agrarian structure dependent regional social cultural historical factors state’s undertaken activities
historiography according braudel before annales approach writing history focused courte durée short span histoire événementielle history events
followers admired use longue durée approach stress slow often imperceptible effects space climate technology actions human beings past
annales historians after living through two world wars massive political upheavals france very uncomfortable notion multiple ruptures discontinuities created history
preferred stress inertia longue durée arguing continuities deepest structures society central history
upheavals institutions superstructure social life little significance history argued lies beyond reach conscious actors especially will revolutionaries
rejected marxist idea history should used tool foment foster revolutions
proponent historical materialism braudel rejected marxist materialism stressing equal importance infrastructure superstructure both reflected enduring social economic cultural realities
braudel's structures both mental environmental determine long-term course events constraining actions humans over duration long enough beyond consciousness actors involved
