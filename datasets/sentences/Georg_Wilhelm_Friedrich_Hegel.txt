thought freedom hegel's thinking understood constructive development within broad tradition includes plato immanuel kant
list add proclus meister eckhart gottfried wilhelm leibniz plotinus jakob böhme jean-jacques rousseau
these thinkers share distinguishes them materialists like epicurus stoics thomas hobbes empiricists like david hume regard freedom self-determination both real having important ontological implications soul mind divinity
focus freedom generates plato's notion phaedo republic timaeus soul having higher fuller kind reality inanimate objects possess
while aristotle criticizes plato's forms preserves plato's cornerstones ontological implications self-determination ethical reasoning soul's pinnacle hierarchy nature order cosmos assumption reasoned arguments prime mover
kant imports plato's high esteem individual sovereignty considerations moral noumenal freedom well god
three find common ground unique position humans scheme things known discussed categorical differences animals inanimate objects
discussion spirit encyclopedia hegel praises aristotle's soul far most admirable perhaps even sole work philosophical value topic
phenomenology spirit science logic hegel's concern kantian topics such freedom morality their ontological implications pervasive
rather simply rejecting kant's dualism freedom versus nature hegel aims subsume within true infinity concept notion begriff spirit ethical life such way kantian duality rendered intelligible rather remaining brute given
reason why subsumption takes place series concepts hegel's method science logic encyclopedia begin basic concepts like being nothing develop these through long sequence elaborations including those already mentioned
manner solution reached principle account true infinity science logic's chapter quality repeated new guises later stages way spirit ethical life third volume encyclopedia
way hegel intends defend germ truth kantian dualism against reductive eliminative programs like those materialism empiricism
like plato dualism soul versus bodily appetites kant pursues mind's ability question felt inclinations appetites come up standard duty plato's case good transcends bodily restrictiveness
hegel preserves essential platonic kantian concern form infinity going beyond finite process hegel fact relates freedom ought133–136 138 universal going beyond particular concept spirit going beyond nature
hegel renders these dualities intelligible ultimately argument quality chapter science logic
finite become infinite order achieve reality
idea absolute excludes multiplicity subjective objective must achieve synthesis become whole
because hegel suggests introduction concept reality111 determines itself—rather depending relations other things essential character—is fully real following latin etymology real thing-like does
finite things don't determine themselves because finite things their essential character determined their boundaries over against other finite things
order become real must go beyond their finitude finitude transcending itself145 result argument finite infinite—and extension particular universal nature freedom—don't face another two independent realities instead latter each case self-transcending former
146 rather stress distinct singularity each factor complements conflicts others—without explanation—the relationship finite infinite particular universal nature freedom becomes intelligible progressively developing self-perfecting whole
progress mystical writings böhme strong effect hegel
[citation needed] böhme written fall man necessary stage evolution universe
evolution itself result god's desire complete self-awareness
hegel fascinated works kant rousseau johann wolfgang goethe french revolution
modern philosophy culture society seemed hegel fraught contradictions tensions such those subject object knowledge mind nature self other freedom authority knowledge faith enlightenment romanticism
hegel's main philosophical project take these contradictions tensions interpret them part comprehensive evolving rational unity different contexts called absolute idea absolute knowledge
according hegel main characteristic unity evolved through manifested itself contradiction negation
contradiction negation dynamic quality every point each domain reality—consciousness history philosophy art nature society—leads further development until rational unity reached preserves contradictions phases sub-parts lifting them up aufhebung higher unity
whole mental because mind comprehend these phases sub-parts steps own process comprehension
rational because same underlying logical developmental order underlies every domain reality ultimately order self-conscious rational thought although later stages development does come full self-consciousness
rational self-conscious whole thing being lies outside other existing things minds
rather comes completion philosophical comprehension individual existing human minds through their own understanding bring developmental process understanding itself
hegel's thought revolutionary extent philosophy absolute negation long absolute negation center systematization remains open makes possible human beings become subjects
mind spirit common english translations hegel's use german geist
some[who?] argued either these terms overly psychologize hegel[citation needed] implying kind disembodied solipsistic consciousness like ghost soul
geist combines meaning spirit—as god ghost mind—with intentional force
hegel's early philosophy nature draft manuscripts written during time university jena hegel's notion geist tightly bound notion aether hegel also derived concepts space time however later works after jena hegel explicitly use old notion aether any
central hegel's conception knowledge mind therefore also reality notion identity difference mind externalizes itself various forms objects stand outside opposed through recognizing itself them itself these external manifestations same time mind other-than-mind
notion identity difference intimately bound up conception contradiction negativity principal feature differentiating hegel's thought other philosophers
civil society see also civil society hegel made distinction civil society state elements philosophy right
work civil society hegel used term bürgerliche gesellschaft though now referred zivilgesellschaft german emphasize inclusive community stage dialectical relationship occurs hegel's perceived opposites macro-community state micro-community family
broadly speaking term split like hegel's followers political left right
left became foundation karl marx's civil society economic base right became description non-state state peak objective spirit aspects society including culture society politics
liberal distinction political society civil society followed alexis de tocqueville
fact hegel's distinctions meant civil society often unclear
example while seems case felt civil-society such german society lived inevitable movement dialectic made way crushing other types lesser fully realized types civil society these societies fully conscious aware lack progress their societies
thus perfectly legitimate eyes hegel conqueror such napoleon come along destroy fully realized
heraclitus according hegel heraclitus first declared nature infinite first grasped nature itself infinite essence process
origin philosophy dated heraclitus
persistent idea same philosophers up present day idea plato aristotle
hegel heraclitus's great achievements understood nature infinite hegel includes understanding inherent contradictoriness negativity reality grasped reality becoming process being nothingness mere empty abstractions
according hegel heraclitus's obscurity comes being true hegel's terms speculative philosopher grasped ultimate philosophical truth therefore expressed himself way goes beyond abstract limited nature common sense difficult grasp those operate within common sense
hegel asserted heraclitus antecedent logic
there no proposition heraclitus adopted my logic
hegel cites number fragments heraclitus lectures history philosophy
attributes great significance fragment translates being non-being interprets mean sein und nichts sei dasselbe being non-being same
heraclitus does form any abstract nouns ordinary use become fragment seems opposing any identity any other identity c etc
hegel however interprets not-a existing nothing cannot conceived indeterminate pure being without particularity specificity
pure being pure non-being nothingness hegel pure abstractions reality becoming also how interprets heraclitus
interpretation heraclitus cannot ruled out even present main gist thought
hegel inner movement reality process god thinking manifested evolution universe nature thought hegel argued fully properly understood reality being thought god manifested person's comprehension process through philosophy
since human thought image fulfillment god's thought god ineffable incomprehensible unutterable understood analysis thought reality
just humans continually correct their concepts reality through dialectical process god himself becomes fully manifested through dialectical process becoming
god hegel does take logos heraclitus refers rather nous anaxagoras although may well regarded them same continues refer god's plan identical god
whatever nous thinks any time actual substance identical limited being remains thought substrate non-being identical pure unlimited thought
universe becoming therefore combination being non-being
particular never complete itself find completion continually transformed comprehensive complex self-relating particulars
essential nature being-for-itself free itself does depend anything else such matter being
limitations represent fetters must constantly casting off becomes freer self-determining
although hegel began philosophizing commentary christian religion often expresses view christian ideas god acceptable christians although major influence 19 th- 20 th-century theology
same time atheistic version thought adopted instead marxists stripping away concepts divinity styled left dialectical materialism saw originating heraclitus
religion graduate protestant seminary hegel's theological concerns reflected many writings lectures
hegel's thoughts person jesus christ stood out theologies enlightenment
posthumously published lectures philosophy religion part 3 hegel shown being particularly interested demonstrations god's existence ontological proof
espouses god abstraction concrete god
god considered terms eternal idea generate son distinguish himself himself process differentiating namely love spirit
means jesus son god posited god over against himself other
hegel sees both relational unity metaphysical unity jesus god father
hegel jesus both divine human
hegel further attests god jesus died
rather reversal takes place god say maintains himself process latter death death
god rises again life thus things reversed
walter kaufmann argued there great stress sharp criticisms traditional christianity appearing hegel's so-called early theological writings
kaufmann admits hegel treated many distinctively christian themes sometimes resist equating conception spirit geist god instead saying clearly god believe spirit suffices me
kaufmann also points out hegel's references god divine—and also spirit—drew classical greek well christian connotations terms
kaufmann goes addition beloved greeks hegel saw before example spinoza own time poetry goethe schiller hölderlin also liked speak gods divine
too sometimes spoke god often divine because occasionally took pleasure insisting really closer christian tradition theologians time sometimes understood christian according hegel himself philosophy consistent christianity

come profound impact many future philosophical schools including schools opposed hegel's specific dialectical idealism such existentialism historical materialism marx historism british idealism
hegel's influence immense both within philosophy other sciences
throughout 19 th century many chairs philosophy around europe held hegelians søren kierkegaard ludwig feuerbach marx friedrich engels—among many others—were deeply influenced also strongly opposed many central themes hegel's philosophy
scholars continue find point out hegelian influences approaches wide range theoretical and/or learned works such carl von clausewitz's magnum opus strategic thought war 1831
after less generation hegel's philosophy suppressed even banned prussian right-wing firmly rejected left-wing multiple official writings
after period bruno bauer hegel's influence make itself felt again until philosophy british idealism 20 th century hegelian western marxism began györgy lukács
recent movement communitarianism strong hegelian influence
reading hegel hegel's writing intended those advanced knowledge philosophy although encyclopedia intended textbook university course
nevertheless hegel assumes readers well-versed western philosophy
especially crucial aristotle kant kant's immediate successors most prominently fichte schelling
those without background well-advised begin many general introductions thought
case difficulties magnified those reading translation
fact hegel himself argues science logic german language particularly conducive philosophical thought
especially difficult aspect hegel's work innovation logic
response immanuel kant's challenge limits pure reason hegel develops radically new form logic called speculative
difficulty reading hegel perceived hegel's own day persists 21 st century
understand hegel fully requires paying attention critique standard logic such law contradiction law excluded middle
many philosophers came after hegel influenced whether adopting rejecting ideas without fully absorbing new speculative dialectical logic
[citation needed] according walter kaufmann basic idea hegel's works especially phenomenology spirit philosopher should confine herself views held penetrate these human reality reflect
other words enough consider propositions even content consciousness worthwhile ask every instance kind spirit entertain such propositions hold such views such consciousness
every outlook other words studied merely academic possibility existential reality
left right hegelianism historians spoken hegel's influence represented two opposing camps
right hegelians allegedly direct disciples hegel friedrich-wilhelms-universität advocated protestant orthodoxy political conservatism post-napoleon restoration period
left hegelians also known young hegelians interpreted hegel revolutionary sense leading advocation atheism religion liberal democracy politics
recent studies however paradigm questioned
no hegelians period ever referred themselves right hegelians term insult originated david strauss self-styled left hegelian
critiques hegel offered left hegelians radically diverted hegel's thinking new directions eventually came form disproportionately large part literature hegel
[citation needed] left hegelians also spawned marxism inspired global movements encompassing russian revolution chinese revolution myriad revolutionary practices up until present moment
twentieth-century interpretations hegel mostly shaped british idealism logical positivism marxism fascism
italian fascist giovanni gentile according benedetto croce
holds honor having most rigorous neo-hegelian entire history western philosophy dishonor having official philosopher fascism italy
however since fall ussr new wave hegel scholarship arose west without preconceptions prior schools thought

french revolution cause creation antithesis e
reign terror followed eventually result synthesis e
constitutional state free citizens
however hegel used classification once attributed terminology kant
terminology largely developed earlier fichte
spread heinrich moritz chalybäus accounts hegelian philosophy since then terms used descriptive type framework
thesis-antithesis-synthesis approach gives sense things ideas contradicted opposed things come outside them
contrary fundamental notion hegel's dialectic things ideas internal contradictions
hegel's point view analysis comprehension thing idea reveals underneath apparently simple identity unity underlying inner contradiction
contradiction leads dissolution thing idea simple form presented itself higher-level complex thing idea adequately incorporates contradiction
triadic form appears many places hegel e
being-nothingness-becoming immediate-mediate-concrete abstract-negative-concrete movement inner contradiction higher-level integration unification
hegel reason speculative dialectical
believing traditional description hegel's philosophy terms thesis-antithesis-synthesis mistaken few scholars like raya dunayevskaya attempted discard triadic approach altogether
according their argument although hegel refers two elemental considerations first idea freedom absolute final aim secondly means realising
subjective side knowledge will life movement activity thesis antithesis doesn't use synthesis instead speaks whole then recognised state moral whole reality freedom consequently objective unity these two elements
furthermore hegel's language dialectical aspect moment thought reality things thoughts turn their opposites their inner contradictions brought surface called aufhebung preliminary speculative synthesizing aspect moment grasps unity these opposites contradiction
widely admitted today old-fashioned description hegel's philosophy terms thesis-antithesis-synthesis inaccurate
nevertheless such persistence misnomer model terminology survive number scholarly works
renaissance last half 20 th century hegel's philosophy underwent major renaissance
due rediscovery reevaluation hegel possible philosophical progenitor marxism philosophically oriented marxists resurgence historical perspective hegel brought everything c increasing recognition importance dialectical method
