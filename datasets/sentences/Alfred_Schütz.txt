schutz strongly influenced ludwig von mises henri bergson william james edmund husserl
contrary common belief while schutz’s work paralled george herbert mead’s analysis meanings within social interactions schutz highly critical mead’s behavioristic approach
although schütz never student husserl collegeague felix kaufmann intensively studied husserl's work order seek basis interpretive sociology derived max weber
1932 schutz’s efforts resulted first published book sinnhafte aufbau sozialen welt literally translated meaningful construction social world published english phenomenology social world
schütz took up general emphasis phenomenology
argues everyday life apart scientific philosophical theories most important focus analysis
publication brought attention husserl whom 'frequently thereafter visited' 'although corresponded husserl until latter's death [in 1938] unable accept offer become assistant' freiburg university personal reasons
schütz's main concerns how people grasp consciousness others while live within their own stream consciousness
talked much intersubjectivity larger sense
used mean concern social world specifically social nature knowledge
great deal work deals life world
within people create social reality well constrained preexisting factors structures place both socially culturally
very focused dialectical relationship way people construct social reality obdurate social cultural reality inherit those preceded them social world legacy influence schütz's writings lasting impact sociology both phenomenological approaches sociology especially through work thomas luckmann peter l
berger ethnomethodology through writings harold garfinkel
luckmann heavily influenced schütz's work
luckmann student schütz's along peter l
berger ultimately finished schütz's work structures lifeworld after schütz died filling out unfinished notes
berger luckmann went use schütz's work further understand human culture reality
noted farganis 2011 peter berger arguably schutz’s best-known living sociologist due authorship social construction theory explain how processes externalization objectication internalization contribute social construction reality
phenomenology phenomenology originated edmund husserl
schütz became friends husserl soon after began working concept
phenomenology study things appear phenomena
also often descriptive rather explanatory central task phenomenology provide clear undistorted description ways things appear
there many assumptions behind phenomenology help explain creation
first rejects concept objective research
phenomenologists rather group presumptions through process called phenomenological epoche
second phenomenology believes analyzing daily human behavior will provide comprehensive understanding nature
third assumption persons individuals should explored questioned
sociologically speaking part because persons better understood unique ways reflect symbolize society she lives
fourth phenomenologists prefer gather “capta” conscious experience rather traditional data
finally phenomenology considered oriented discovery therefore phenomenologists gather research using methods far less restricting other sciences
phenomenological sociology noted farganis 2011 phenomenological sociology characterized particularly subjective nature because emphasis understanding reality through perspective through acting subject rather lens scientific observer
rather attempting uncover document social structures influence our social world schultz other sociological phenomenologists seek identify content our consciousnes related our conception social reality everyday life also how reality comes assume form
essence schutz social phenomenologists principally concerned happenings everyday life schultz refers ‘life world’
noted ritzer 2011 life world “is intersubjective world people both create social reality constrained preexisting social cultural structures created their predecessors
within world relationships social natural world come doubt
there existence meaning comes play yet most people simply accept world how never second guess concept problem meaning
schütz delves even specific relationships such difference intimate face-to-face relationships distant impersonal relationships
four divisions lifeworld 'schütz according natanson phenomenology's spokesman lebenswelt
mundane lifeworld' divided four distinct subworlds called 'the crux schütz's theoretical contribution
believes our social experience makes up vast world
distinguish[d] directly experienced social reality social reality lying beyond horizon direct experience'
former consisted umwelt schütz termed consociates fellow-men - man 'shares me community space community time'
contrast 'those am directly perceiving fall three classes
first comes world my contemporaries mitwelt then world my predecessors vorwelt finally world my successors folgewelt'
last two represent past future whereas one's contemporaries share community time space 'are distinguished other two fact principle possible them become my consociates'
schütz interested mapping 'the transition direct indirect experience
two poles stretches continuous series experiences' well called progressive anonymisation mitwelt 'scale increasing anonymity
there instance my absent friend brother whom described me professor whose books read postal clerk canadian parliament abstract entities like canada herself rules english grammar basic principles jurisprudence'
schütz 'the further out go world contemporaries anonymous inhabitants become' ending most anonymous - 'artifacts any kind bear witness subjective meaning-context unknown person' nothing
later writings schütz explored way 'in social situations everyday life relations pertaining these dimensions frequently intertwined
various degrees anonymity'
thus instance 'if face-to-face relationship friend discuss magazine article dealing attitude president congress toward
am relationship perhaps anonymous contemporary writer article also contemporary individual collective actors social scene designated terms president congress china'
