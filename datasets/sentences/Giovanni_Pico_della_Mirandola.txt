16 th century portrait giovanni pico della mirandola
1480 1482 continued studies university padua major center aristotelianism italy
already proficient latin greek studied hebrew arabic padua elia del medigo jewish averroist read aramaic manuscripts well
del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts hebrew latin pico continue number years
pico also sonnets latin italian because influence savonarola destroyed end life
spent next four years either home visiting humanist centres elsewhere italy
1485 travelled university paris most important centre europe scholastic philosophy theology hotbed secular averroism
probably paris giovanni began 900 theses conceived idea defending them public debate
florence during time two life-changing events occurred
first returned settle time florence november 1484 met lorenzo de' medici marsilio ficino
astrologically auspicious day ficino chosen publish translations works plato greek latin under lorenzo’s enthusiastic patronage
pico appears charmed both men despite ficino's philosophical differences convinced their saturnine affinity divine providence arrival
lorenzo support protect pico until death 1492
without lorenzo's support doubtful pico survived ten years beyond lorenzo's death
soon after stay florence pico travelling way rome intended publish 900 theses prepare congress scholars over europe debate them
stopping arezzo became embroiled love affair wife lorenzo de' medici's cousins
almost cost life
giovanni attempted run off woman caught wounded thrown prison her husband
released upon intervention lorenzo himself
incident wholly representative pico's often audacious temperament loyalty affection nevertheless inspire
pico spent several months perugia nearby fratta recovering injuries
there ficino divine providence
caused certain books fall my hands
chaldean books
esdras zoroaster melchior oracles magi contain brief dry interpretation chaldean philosophy full mystery
also perugia pico introduced mystical hebrew kabbalah fascinated late classical hermetic writers such hermes trismegistus
kabbalah hermetica thought pico's time ancient old testament reason accorded them almost scriptural status
pico's intention walk completely around topic look many possible angles order derive truest possible vision thing itself
syncretism pico seeing same absolute many different points view scholastic approach strong modern resonance
pico based ideas chiefly plato teacher marsilio ficino retained deep respect aristotle
although product studia humanitatis pico constitutionally eclectic respects represented reaction against exaggerations pure humanism defending believed best medieval islamic commentators such averroes avicenna aristotle famous long letter ermolao barbaro 1485
pico’s aim reconcile schools plato aristotle since believed both used different words express same concepts
perhaps reason friends called princeps concordiae prince harmony pun prince concordia family's holdings
similarly pico believed educated person should also study hebrew talmudic sources hermetics because believed represented same concept god seen old testament different words
finished oration dignity man accompany 900 theses traveled rome continue plan defend them
them published together december 1486 conclusiones philosophicae cabalasticae et theologicae offered pay expenses any scholars came rome debate them publicly
february 1487 pope innocent viii halted proposed debate established commission review orthodoxy 900 theses
although pico answered charges against them thirteen them condemned
pico agreed writing retract them change mind their validity
proceeded write apologia defending them apologia j
pici mirandolani concordiae comitis published 1489 dedicated apparently very tolerant patron lorenzo
pope apprised circulation manuscript set up inquisitorial tribunal forcing pico renounce apologia addition other condemned theses agreed
pope declared 900 theses part heretical part flower heresy several scandalous offensive pious ears most nothing reproduce errors pagan philosophers
others capable inflaming impertinence jews number them finally under pretext 'natural philosophy' favor arts enemies catholic faith human race
pico fled france 1488 arrested philip ii duke savoy demand papal nuncios imprisoned vincennes
through intercession several italian princes — instigated lorenzo de' medici — king charles viii released pope persuaded allow pico move florence live under lorenzo’s protection
cleared papal censures restrictions until 1493 after accession alexander vi rodrigo borgia papacy
pico deeply shaken experience
reconciled savonarola remained very close friend
pico’s persuasion lorenzo invited savonarola florence
pico never renounced syncretist convictions
settled villa near fiesole prepared lorenzo published heptaplus id est de dei creatoris opere 1489 de ente et uno being unity 1491
here also other most celebrated work disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium treatise against predictive astrology published until after death
pico acidly condemned deterministic practices astrologers day
after death lorenzo de' medici 1492 pico moved ferrara although continued visit florence
florence political instability gave rise increasing influence savonarola whose reactionary opposition renaissance expansion style already brought conflict medici family eventually expelled florence lead wholesale destruction books paintings
nevertheless pico became follower savonarola
determined become monk dismissed former interest egyptian chaldean texts destroyed own poetry gave away fortune
1494 pico friend angelio poliziano poisoned under mysterious circumstances
rumored own secretary poisoned because pico become too close savonarola
interred san marco savonarola delivered funeral oration
ficino “our dear pico left us same day charles viii entering florence tears men letters compensated joy people
without light brought king france florence might perhaps never seen somber day extinguished mirandola's light

scientists under supervision giorgio gruppioni professor anthropology bologna will use current testing techniques study men's lives establish causes their deaths
tv documentary being made research recently announced these forensic tests showed both poliziano pico likely died arsenic poisoning probably order lorenzo's successor piero de' medici
writings oratio de hominis dignitate oration dignity man 1486 pico justified importance human quest knowledge within neoplatonic framework
oration also served introduction pico's 900 theses believed provide complete sufficient basis discovery knowledge hence model mankind's ascent chain being
900 theses good example humanist syncretism because pico combined platonism neoplatonism aristotelianism hermeticism kabbalah
also included 72 theses describing pico believed complete system physics
mirandola's de animae immortalitate paris 1541 other works developed doctrine man's possession immortal soul freed hierarchical stasis
pico may believed universal reconciliation since 900 theses mortal sin finite duration deserving eternal temporal punishment among theses pronounced heretical pope innocent viii bull aug
4 1487
oration writes human vocation mystical vocation realized following three stage way comprehends necessarily moral transformation intellectual research final perfection identity absolute reality
paradigm universal because retraced every tradition
portion disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem published bologna after death
book pico presents arguments against practice astrology enormous resonance centuries up our own time
disputationes influenced arguments against astrology espoused intellectual heroes st
augustine hippo also medieval philosophical tale hayy ibn-yaqzan promoted autodidacticism philosophical program
pico’s antagonism astrology seems derive mainly conflict astrology christian notions free will
pico’s arguments moved beyond objections ficino himself astrologer
manuscript edited publication after pico’s death nephew giovanni francesco pico della mirandola ardent follower savonarola may possibly amended forcefully critical
might possibly explain fact ficino championed manuscript enthusiastically endorsed before publication
pico’s heptaplus mystico-allegorical exposition creation according seven biblical senses elaborates idea different religions traditions describe same god
being latin de ente et uno explanations several passages moses plato aristotle
attempted reconciliation platonic aristotelian writings relative places being refutation opposing arguments
italian imitation plato's symposium
letters aureae ad familiares epistolae paris 1499 important history contemporary thought
