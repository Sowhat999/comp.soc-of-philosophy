understand socrates thought must turn primarily works plato whose dialogues thought most informative source socrates' life philosophy also xenophon
these writings sokratikoi logoi socratic dialogues consist reports conversations apparently involving socrates
discovering real-life socrates difficulty ancient sources mostly philosophical dramatic texts apart xenophon
there no straightforward histories contemporary socrates dealt own time place
corollary sources mention socrates necessarily claim historically accurate often partisan
instance those prosecuted convicted socrates left no testament
historians therefore face challenge reconciling various evidence extant texts order attempt accurate consistent account socrates' life work

seem therefore ugly socrates brilliant intellect
socrates figure character socrates exhibited apology crito phaedo symposium concurs other sources extent seems possible rely platonic socrates demonstrated dialogues representation actual socrates lived history
same time however many scholars believe works plato being literary artist pushed avowedly brightened-up version socrates far beyond anything historical socrates likely done
also xenophon being historian reliable witness historical socrates

military service time socrates fulfilled role hoplite participating peloponnesian war—a conflict stretched intermittently over period spanning 431 404
several plato's dialogues refer socrates' military service
monologue apology socrates states active athens battles amphipolis delium potidaea
symposium alcibiades describes socrates' valour battles potidaea delium recounting how socrates saved life former battle 219 e-221

plato refers socrates gadfly state gadfly stings horse action socrates stung various athenians insofar irritated people considerations justice pursuit goodness
attempts improve athenians' sense justice may cause execution
according plato's apology socrates' life gadfly athens began friend chaerephon asked oracle delphi anyone wiser socrates oracle responded no-one wiser
socrates believed oracle's response paradox because believed possessed no wisdom whatsoever
proceeded test riddle approaching men considered wise people athens—statesmen poets artisans—in order refute oracle's pronouncement
questioning them however socrates concluded while each man thought knew great deal wise fact knew very little wise
socrates realized oracle correct while so-called wise men thought themselves wise yet himself knew wise paradoxically made wiser since person aware own ignorance
socrates' paradoxical wisdom made prominent athenians publicly questioned look foolish turning them against leading accusations wrongdoing
socrates defended role gadfly until end trial socrates asked propose own punishment suggested wage paid government free dinners rest life instead finance time spent athens' benefactor

alternative interpretation dialectic method direct perception form good
philosopher karl popper describes dialectic art intellectual intuition visualising divine originals forms ideas unveiling great mystery behind common man's everyday world appearances
similar vein french philosopher pierre hadot suggests dialogues type spiritual exercise
hadot writes plato's view every dialectical exercise precisely because exercise pure thought subject demands logos turns soul away sensible world allows convert itself towards good
philosophical beliefs beliefs socrates distinct those plato difficult discern
little way concrete evidence exists demarcate two
lengthy presentation ideas given most dialogues may ideas socrates himself subsequently deformed changed plato scholars think plato adapted socratic style make literary character philosopher himself impossible distinguish
others argue own theories beliefs
there degree controversy inherent identifying these might owing difficulty separating socrates plato difficulty interpreting even dramatic writings concerning socrates
consequently distinguishing philosophical beliefs socrates those plato xenophon proven easy must remembered attributed socrates might actually specific concerns these two thinkers instead
matter complicated because historical socrates seems notorious asking questions answering claiming lack wisdom concerning subjects questioned others
anything general philosophical beliefs socrates morally intellectually politically odds many fellow athenians
trial heresy corrupting minds youth athens uses method elenchos demonstrate jurors their moral values wrong-headed
tells them concerned their families careers political responsibilities ought worried welfare their souls
socrates' assertion gods singled out divine emissary seemed provoke irritation outright ridicule

socrates frequently says ideas own teachers'
mentions several influences prodicus rhetor anaxagoras philosopher
perhaps surprisingly socrates claims deeply influenced two women besides mother says diotima c
plato's symposium witch priestess mantinea taught knows eros love aspasia mistress pericles taught art rhetoric
john burnet argued principal teacher anaxagorean archelaus ideas plato described them eric
havelock other hand considered socrates' association anaxagoreans evidence plato's philosophical separation socrates
socratic paradoxes many beliefs traditionally attributed historical socrates characterized paradoxical because seem conflict common sense
following among so-called socratic paradoxes no desires evil
no errs does wrong willingly knowingly
virtue—all virtue—is knowledge
virtue sufficient happiness
term socratic paradox also refer self-referential paradox originating socrates' utterance know think know often paraphrased know know nothing
knowledge statement know know nothing often attributed socrates based statement plato's apology
conventional interpretation socrates' wisdom limited awareness own ignorance
socrates considered virtuousness require consist phronēsis thought sense judgement practical wisdom [and] prudence
therefore believed wrongdoing behaviour virtuous resulted ignorance those wrong knew no better
thing socrates claimed knowledge art love ta erôtikê
assertion seems associated word erôtan means ask questions
therefore socrates claiming know art love insofar knows how ask questions
time actually claimed wise within apology says wise limited sense having human wisdom
debatable whether socrates believed humans opposed gods like apollo actually become wise
hand drew clear line human ignorance ideal knowledge other plato's symposium diotima's speech republic allegory cave describe method ascending wisdom
plato's theaetetus 150 socrates compares treatment young people come philosophical advice way midwives treat their patients way matrimonial matchmakers act

perhaps significantly points out midwives barren due age women never given birth unable become midwives no experience knowledge birth unable separate worthy infants those should left hillside exposed
judge midwife must experience knowledge she judging
virtue bust socrates palermo archaeological museum
socrates believed best way people live focus pursuit virtue rather pursuit instance material wealth
invited others try concentrate friendships sense true community socrates felt best way people grow together populace
actions lived up standard end socrates accepted death sentence most thought simply leave athens felt run away go against will community mentioned above reputation valor battlefield without reproach
idea there certain virtues formed common thread socrates' teachings
these virtues represented most important qualities person foremost philosophical intellectual virtues
socrates stressed unexamined life worth living [and] ethical virtue thing matters
politics argued socrates believed ideals belong world wise man understand making philosopher type person suitable govern others
plato's dialogue republic socrates openly objected democracy ran athens during adult life
athenian democracy socrates found short ideal any government conform presentation perfect regime led philosophers athenian government far
however possible socrates plato's republic colored plato's own views
during last years socrates' life athens continual flux due political upheaval
democracy last overthrown junta known thirty tyrants led plato's relative critias once student friend socrates
tyrants ruled year before athenian democracy reinstated point declared amnesty recent events
socrates' opposition democracy often denied question biggest philosophical debates trying determine exactly socrates believed
strongest argument those claim socrates actually believe idea philosopher kings view expressed no earlier plato's republic widely considered plato's middle dialogues representative historical socrates' views
furthermore according plato's apology socrates early dialogue socrates refused pursue conventional politics often stated look other's matters tell people how live their lives yet understand how live own
believed philosopher engaged pursuit truth claim know fully
socrates' acceptance death sentence after conviction also seen support view
often claimed much anti-democratic leanings plato never able overcome disgust done teacher
any case clear socrates thought rule thirty tyrants also objectionable called before them assist arrest fellow athenian socrates refused narrowly escaped death before tyrants overthrown
however fulfill duty serve prytanis trial group generals presided over disastrous naval campaign judged even then maintained uncompromising attitude being those refused proceed manner supported laws despite intense pressure
judging actions considered rule thirty tyrants less legitimate democratic senate sentenced death
socrates' apparent respect democracy themes emphasized 2008 play socrates trial andrew david irvine
irvine argues because loyalty athenian democracy socrates willing accept verdict fellow citizens
irvine puts during time war great social intellectual upheaval socrates felt compelled express views openly regardless consequences
result remembered today sharp wit high ethical standards also loyalty view democracy best way man serve himself friends city—even during times war—is being loyal speaking publicly truth
covertness dialogues plato though socrates sometimes seems support mystical side discussing reincarnation mystery religions generally attributed plato
regardless view socrates cannot dismissed out hand cannot sure differences views plato socrates addition there seem corollaries works xenophon
culmination philosophic path discussed plato's symposium comes sea beauty sight beautiful itself 211 c then become wise
symposium socrates credits speech philosophic path teacher priestess diotima even sure socrates capable reaching highest mysteries
meno refers eleusinian mysteries telling meno understand socrates' answers better stay initiations next week
further confusions result nature these sources insofar platonic dialogues arguably work artist-philosopher whose meaning does volunteer itself passive reader nor again lifelong scholar
according olympiodorus younger life plato plato himself received instruction writers tragedy before taking up study philosophy
works indeed dialogues plato's choice medium sophocles euripides fictions theatre may reflect ever-interpretable nature writings called dramatist reason
first word nearly plato's works significant term respective dialogue used many connotations mind
finally phaedrus symposium each allude socrates' coy delivery philosophic truths conversation socrates phaedrus goes far demand such dissembling mystery writing
covertness often find plato appearing here there couched enigmatic use symbol and/or irony may odds mysticism plato's socrates expounds other dialogues
these indirect methods may fail satisfy readers
perhaps most interesting facet socrates' reliance greeks called daimōnic sign averting ἀποτρεπτικός apotreptikos inner voice socrates heard make mistake
sign prevented socrates entering politics
phaedrus socrates considered form divine madness sort insanity gift gods gives us poetry mysticism love even philosophy itself
alternately sign often taken call intuition however socrates' characterization phenomenon daimōnic may suggest origin divine mysterious independent own thoughts
today such voice classified under diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders command hallucination
satirical playwrights prominently lampooned aristophanes' comedy clouds produced socrates mid-forties trial according plato laughter theater harder task answer arguments accusers
søren kierkegaard believed play accurate representation socrates those students
play socrates ridiculed dirtiness associated laconizing fad also plays callias eupolis telecleides
other comic poets lampooned socrates include mnesimachus ameipsias
these socrates sophists criticized moral dangers inherent contemporary thought literature
prose sources plato xenophon aristotle main sources historical socrates however xenophon plato students socrates may idealize however continuous descriptions socrates come down us their complete form
aristotle refers frequently passing socrates writings
almost plato's works center socrates
however plato's later works appear own philosophy put mouth mentor
socratic dialogues main article socratic dialogue socratic dialogues series dialogues written plato xenophon form discussions socrates other persons time discussions socrates' followers over concepts
plato's phaedo example latter category
although apology monologue delivered socrates usually grouped dialogues
apology professes record actual speech socrates delivered own defense trial
athenian jury system apology composed three parts speech followed counter-assessment then final words
apology transliteration translation greek apologia meaning defense sense apologetic according our contemporary use term
plato generally does place own ideas mouth specific speaker lets ideas emerge via socratic method under guidance socrates
most dialogues present socrates applying method extent nowhere completely euthyphro
dialogue socrates euthyphro go through several iterations refining answer socrates' question
pious impious? plato's dialogues learning appears process remembering
soul before incarnation body realm ideas very similar platonic forms
there saw things way truly rather pale shadows copies experience earth
process questioning soul brought remember ideas their pure form thus bringing wisdom
especially plato's writings referring socrates clear ideas brought forward socrates friends actually belonged socrates these may new additions elaborations plato known socratic problem
generally early works plato considered close spirit socrates whereas later works including phaedo republic considered possibly products plato's elaborations
legacy immediate influence statue socrates front academy athens modern immediately students socrates set work both exercising their perceptions teachings politics also developing many new philosophical schools thought
athens' controversial anti-democratic tyrants contemporary posthumous students socrates including alcibiades critias
critias' cousin plato go found academy 385 bc gained much renown academy became standard word educational institutions later european languages such english french italian
plato's protege another important figure classical era aristotle went tutor alexander great also found own school 335 bc—the lyceum—whose name also now means educational institution
while socrates dealt moral matters took no notice nature general dialogues plato emphasize mathematics metaphysical overtones mirroring pythagoras former dominate western thought well renaissance
aristotle himself much philosopher scientist extensive work fields biology physics
socratic thought challenged conventions especially stressing simplistic way living became divorced plato's detached philosophical pursuits
idea inherited socrates' older students antisthenes became originator another philosophy years after socrates' death cynicism
idea asceticism being hand hand ethical life piety ignored plato aristotle somewhat dealt cynics formed core another philosophy 281 bc stoicism zeno citium discover socrates' works then learn crates cynic philosopher
later historical influence while later contributions socrates hellenistic era culture philosophy well roman era lost time teachings began resurgence both medieval europe islamic middle east alongside those aristotle stoicism
socrates mentioned dialogue kuzari jewish philosopher rabbi yehuda halevi jew instructs khazar king judaism
al-kindi well-known arabic philosopher introduced tried reconcile socrates hellenistic philosophy islamic audience referring name 'suqrat'
socrates' stature western philosophy returned full force renaissance age reason europe political theory began resurface under those like locke hobbes
voltaire even went far write satirical play trial socrates
there number paintings life including socrates tears alcibiades embrace sensual pleasure jean-baptiste regnault death socrates jacques-louis david later 18 th century
day socratic method still used classroom law school discourse expose underlying issues both subject speaker
recognized accolades ranging frequent mentions pop culture such movie bill & ted's excellent adventure greek rock band called socrates drank conium numerous busts academic institutions recognition contribution education
over past century numerous plays socrates also focused socrates' life influence
most recent socrates trial play based aristophanes' clouds plato's apology crito phaedo adapted modern performance
criticism evaluation reaction socrates undertaken both historians philosophers time death present day multitude conclusions perspectives
although directly prosecuted connection critias leader spartan-backed thirty tyrants showed considerable personal courage refusing submit [them] seen figure mentored oligarchs became abusive tyrants undermined athenian democracy
sophistic movement railed life survived 3 rd century bc rapidly overtaken many philosophical schools thought socrates influenced
socrates' death considered iconic status martyr philosophy overshadows most contemporary posthumous criticism
however xenophon mentions socrates' arrogance expert art pimping self-presentation
direct criticism socrates man almost disappears after time there noticeable preference plato aristotle over elements socratic philosophy distinct those students even middle ages
modern scholarship holds much own thought obscured possibly altered plato impossible gain clear picture socrates amid contradictory evidence
both cynicism stoicism carried heavy influence socratic thought unlike even contrary platonism further illustrates
ambiguity lack reliability serves modern basis criticism—that nearly impossible know real socrates
controversy also exists socrates' attitude towards homosexuality whether believed olympian gods monotheistic held other religious viewpoint
however still commonly taught held little exception socrates progenitor subsequent western philosophy point philosophers before referred pre-socratic
literature socrates major character mary renault's historical novel last wine
book's protagonists alexias lysis study under athens
