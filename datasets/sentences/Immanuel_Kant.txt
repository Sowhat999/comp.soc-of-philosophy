further suggested other nebulae might also similarly large distant disks stars
these postulations opened new horizons astronomy first time extending astronomy beyond solar system galactic extragalactic realms

retinal cells send impulses through optic nerve then form mapping brain visual features object

my great thanks my well-wishers friends think kindly me undertake my welfare same time most humble request protect me my current condition any disturbance
kant emerged silence 1781 result critique pure reason
although now uniformly recognized greatest works history philosophy critique largely ignored upon initial publication
book long over 800 pages original german edition written convoluted style
received few reviews these granted no significance
kant's former student johann gottfried herder criticized placing reason entity worthy criticism instead considering process reasoning within context language one's entire personality
similar christian garve johann georg heinrich feder rejected kant's position space time possessed form analyzed
additionally garve feder also faulted kant's critique explaining differences perception sensations

reception stood stark contrast praise kant received earlier works such prize essay shorter works preceded first critique
these well-received readable tracts include earthquake lisbon popular sold page
prior change course documented first critique books sold well time published observations feeling beautiful sublime 1764 become notable popular author
kant disappointed first critique's reception
recognizing need clarify original treatise kant prolegomena any future metaphysics 1783 summary main views
shortly thereafter kant's friend johann friedrich schultz 1739–1805 professor mathematics published erläuterungen über des herrn professor kant critik reinen vernunft königsberg 1784 brief very accurate commentary kant's critique pure reason
kant's reputation gradually rose through latter portion 1780 s sparked series important works 1784 essay answer question enlightenment? 1785's groundwork metaphysics morals first work moral philosophy 1786 metaphysical foundations natural science
kant's fame ultimately arrived unexpected source
1786 karl leonhard reinhold published series public letters kantian philosophy
these letters reinhold framed kant's philosophy response central intellectual controversy era pantheism dispute
friedrich jacobi accused recently deceased gotthold ephraim lessing distinguished dramatist philosophical essayist spinozism
such charge tantamount atheism vigorously denied lessing's friend moses mendelssohn leading bitter public dispute among partisans
controversy gradually escalated debate values enlightenment value reason
reinhold maintained letters kant's critique pure reason settle dispute defending authority bounds reason
reinhold's letters widely read made kant most famous philosopher era
mature work kant published second edition critique pure reason kritik reinen vernunft 1787 heavily revising first parts book
most subsequent work focused other areas philosophy
continued develop moral philosophy notably 1788's critique practical reason known second critique 1797's metaphysics morals
1790 critique judgment third critique applied kantian system aesthetics teleology
1792 kant's attempt publish second four pieces religion within bounds bare reason journal berlinische monatsschrift met opposition king's censorship commission established same year context french revolution
kant then arranged four pieces published book routing through philosophy department university jena avoid need theological censorship
insubordination earned now famous reprimand king
nevertheless published second edition 1794 censor irate arranged royal order required kant never publish even speak publicly religion
kant then published response king's reprimand explained himself preface conflict faculties
also number semi-popular essays history religion politics other topics
these works well received kant's contemporaries confirmed preeminent status 18 th-century philosophy
there several journals devoted solely defending criticizing kantian philosophy
despite success philosophical trends moving another direction
many kant's most important disciples including reinhold beck fichte transformed kantian position increasingly radical forms idealism
progressive stages revision kant's teachings marked emergence german idealism
kant opposed these developments publicly denounced fichte open letter 1799
final acts expounding stance philosophical questions
1800 student kant named gottlob benjamin jäsche published manual logic teachers called logik prepared kant's request
jäsche prepared logik using copy textbook logic georg freidrich meier entitled auszug aus vernunftlehre kant written copious notes annotations
logik considered fundamental importance kant's philosophy understanding

also robert schirokauer hartman wolfgang schwarz translators' introduction their english translation logik importance lies significance critique pure reason second part restatement fundamental tenets logic position within whole kant's work
kant's health long poor worsened died königsberg 12 february 1804 uttering es ist gut good before expiring
unfinished final work published opus postumum
kant book discussing theory virtue terms independence believed viable modern alternative familiar greek views virtue
book often criticized hostile tone articulating thoughts autocracy comprehensibly

philosophy immanuel kant carle vernet 1758-1836 kant's essay answering question enlightenment? kant defined enlightenment age shaped latin motto sapere aude dare wise
kant maintained ought think autonomously free dictates external authority
work reconciled many differences rationalist empiricist traditions 18 th century
decisive impact romantic german idealist philosophies 19 th century
work also starting point many 20 th century philosophers
kant asserted because limitations argumentation absence irrefutable evidence no really know whether there god afterlife
sake morality ground reason kant asserted people justified believing god even though never know god's presence empirically
explained preparations reason therefore may called pure philosophy reality directed those three problems [god soul freedom]
however these three elements themselves still hold independent proportional objective weight individually
moreover collective relational context namely know ought done will free there god there future world
concerns our actions reference highest aims life see ultimate intention nature her wise provision really constitution our reason directed moral interests
sense enlightened approach critical method required cannot prove thing may try prove
fails either often occurs may still ask whether interest accept other alternatives hypothetically theoretical practical point view
hence question no longer whether perpetual peace real thing real thing whether may deceiving ourselves adopt former alternative must act supposition being real
presupposition god soul freedom then practical concern morality itself constitutes system happiness does unless distributed exact proportion morality
however possible intelligible world under wise author ruler
reason compels us admit such ruler together life such world must consider future life else moral laws considered idle dreams
kant claimed created copernican revolution philosophy
involved two interconnected foundations critical philosophy epistemology transcendental idealism moral philosophy autonomy practical reason
these teachings placed active rational human subject center cognitive moral worlds
kant argued rational order world known science just accidental accumulation sense perceptions
conceptual unification integration carried out mind through concepts categories understanding operating perceptual manifold within space time
latter concepts forms sensibility priori necessary conditions any possible experience
thus objective order nature causal necessity operates within depend mind's processes product rule-based activity kant called synthesis
there much discussion among kant scholars correct interpretation train thought
'two-world' interpretation regards kant's position statement epistemological limitation able transcend bounds our own mind meaning cannot access thing-in-itself
however kant also speaks thing itself transcendental object product human understanding attempts conceive objects abstraction conditions sensibility
following line thought interpreters argued thing itself does represent separate ontological domain simply way considering objects means understanding alone known two-aspect view
notion thing itself much discussed philosophers after kant
argued because thing itself unknowable existence must assumed
rather arbitrarily switching account ungrounded anything supposed real german idealists another group arose ask how our presumably reliable accounts coherent rule-abiding universe actually grounded
new kind philosophy became known phenomenology founder edmund husserl
regard morality kant argued source good lies anything outside human subject either nature given god rather good will itself
good will acts duty accordance universal moral law autonomous human being freely gives itself
law obliges treat humanity understood rational agency represented through oneself well others end itself rather merely means other ends individual might hold
necessitates practical self-reflection universalize our reasons
these ideas largely framed influenced subsequent philosophical discussion analysis
specifics kant's account generated immediate lasting controversy
nevertheless theses mind itself necessarily makes constitutive contribution knowledge contribution transcendental rather psychological philosophy involves self-critical activity morality rooted human freedom act autonomously act according rational moral principles lasting effect subsequent philosophy
theory perception main article critique pure reason kant defines theory perception influential 1781 work critique pure reason often cited most significant volume metaphysics epistemology modern philosophy
kant maintains our understanding external world foundations merely experience both experience priori concepts thus offering non-empiricist critique rationalist philosophy others referred copernican revolution
firstly kant distinguishes analytic synthetic propositions analytic proposition proposition whose predicate concept contained subject concept e
bachelors unmarried bodies take up space
synthetic proposition proposition whose predicate concept contained subject concept e
bachelors happy bodies weight
analytic proposition true nature meaning words sentence — require no further knowledge grasp language understand proposition
other hand synthetic statement tells us something world
truth falsehood synthetic statements derives something outside their linguistic content
instance weight necessary predicate body until heaviness body know weight
case experience body required before heaviness becomes clear
before kant's first critique empiricists cf
hume rationalists cf
leibniz assumed synthetic statements required experience known
kant however contests claims elementary mathematics like arithmetic synthetic priori statements provide new knowledge knowledge derived experience
becomes part over-all argument transcendental idealism
argues possibility experience depends certain necessary conditions — calls priori forms — these conditions structure hold true world experience
doing main claims transcendental aesthetic mathematic judgments synthetic priori addition space time derived experience rather preconditions
once grasped functions basic arithmetic need any empirical experience know 100 + 100 = 200 appears arithmetic analytic
however analytic disproved considering calculation 5 + 7 = 12 there nothing numbers 5 7 number 12 inferred
thus 5 + 7 cube root 1728 12 analytic because their reference same their sense — mathematical judgment 5 + 7 = 12 tells us something new world
self-evident undeniably priori same time synthetic
thus kant proved proposition synthetic known priori
kant asserts experience based both perception external objects priori knowledge
external world writes provides those things sense
our mind processes information gives order allowing us comprehend
our mind supplies conditions space time experience objects
according transcendental unity apperception concepts mind understanding perceptions intuitions garner information phenomena sensibility synthesized comprehension
without concepts perceptions nondescript without perceptions concepts meaningless — thus famous statement thoughts without content empty intuitions perceptions without concepts blind
kant also claims external environment necessary establishment self
although kant want argue there no empirical way observing self see logical necessity self observe different perceptions external environment over time
uniting these general representations global representation see how transcendental self emerges
am therefore conscious identical self regard manifold representations given me intuition because call them together my representations
categories faculty understanding see also category kant kant statue belo horizonte brazil kant deemed obvious objective knowledge world such say newtonian physics
knowledge relies synthetic priori laws nature like causality substance
problem then how possible
kant's solution reason subject must supply laws make experience objects possible these laws synthetic priori laws nature know apply objects before experience them
deduce these laws kant examined experience general dissecting supplied mind supplied given intuitions
just explicated commonly called transcendental reduction
begin kant's distinction posteriori being contingent particular knowledge priori being universal necessary knowledge must kept mind
merely connect two intuitions together perceiving subject knowledge subjective because derived posteriori desired knowledge objective two intuitions refer object hold good necessarily universally anyone anytime just perceiving subject current condition
else equivalent objective knowledge besides priori say universal necessary knowledge? nothing else hence before knowledge objective must incorporated under priori category understanding
example say subject says sun shines stone stone grows warm perceives perception
judgment contingent holds no necessity
says sunshine causes stone warm subsumes perception under category causality found perception necessarily synthesizes concept sunshine concept heat producing necessarily universally true judgment
explain categories detail preconditions construction objects mind
indeed even think sun stone presupposes category subsistence substance
categories synthesize random data sensory manifold intelligible objects
means categories also most abstract things say any object whatsoever hence priori cognition totality objects experience list them
kant formulates another transcendental deduction
judgments kant preconditions any thought
man thinks via judgments possible judgments must listed perceptions connected within them put aside make possible examine moments understanding engaged constructing judgments
categories equivalent these moments concepts intuitions general far determined these moments universally necessarily
thus listing moments deduce them categories
may now ask how many possible judgments there? kant believed possible propositions within aristotle's syllogistic logic equivalent possible judgments logical operators within propositions equivalent moments understanding within judgments
thus listed aristotle's system four groups three quantity universal particular singular quality affirmative negative infinite relation categorical hypothetical disjunctive modality problematic assertoric apodeictic
parallelism kant's categories obvious quantity unity plurality totality quality reality negation limitation relation substance cause community modality possibility existence necessity
fundamental building blocks experience
objective knowledge now place
first there sensibility supplies mind intuitions then there understanding produces judgments these intuitions subsume them under categories
these categories lift intuitions up out subject's current state consciousness place them within consciousness general producing universally necessary knowledge
categories innate any rational being any intuition thought within category mind necessarily subsumed understood identically any mind
other words filter see hear
transcendental schema doctrine see also schema kant kant ran problem theory mind plays part producing objective knowledge
intuitions categories entirely disparate how interact? kant's solution transcendental schema priori principles transcendental imagination connects concepts intuitions through time
principles temporally bound concept purely priori categories then must apply times
hence there principles such substance endures through time cause must prior effect
moral philosophy immanuel kant kant developed moral philosophy three works groundwork metaphysic morals 1785 critique practical reason 1788 metaphysics morals 1797
groundwork kant's method involves trying convert our everyday obvious rational knowledge morality philosophical knowledge
latter two works followed method using practical reason based things reason tell us deriving any principles experience reach conclusions applied world experience second part metaphysic morals
kant known theory there single moral obligation called categorical imperative derived concept duty
kant defines demands moral law categorical imperatives
categorical imperatives principles intrinsically valid good themselves must obeyed everyone situations circumstances our behavior observe moral law
categorical imperative generates other moral obligations tested against
kant also stated moral means ends applied categorical imperative rational beings pursue certain ends using appropriate means
ends based physical needs wants create merely hypothetical imperatives
categorical imperative based something end itself end means other need desire purpose
kant believed moral law principle reason itself based contingent facts world such make us happy act moral law no other motive worthiness being happy
accordingly believed moral obligation applies rational agents
unlike hypothetical imperative categorical imperative unconditional obligation force obligation regardless our will desires groundwork metaphysic morals 1785 kant enumerated three formulations categorical imperative believed roughly equivalent
kant believed action done motive duty then without moral value
thought every action should pure intention behind otherwise meaningless
final result most important aspect action how person felt while carrying out action time value set result
groundwork metaphysic morals kant also posited counter-utilitarian idea there difference preferences values considerations individual rights temper calculations aggregate utility concept axiom economics everything either price dignity
whatever price replaced something else equivalent other hand whatever above price therefore admits no equivalent dignity
constitutes condition under alone something end itself does mere relative worth
price intrinsic worth

first formulation immanuel kant introduced categorical imperative act according maxim whereby you same time will should become universal law
first formulation formula universal law moral imperative requires maxims chosen though should hold universal laws nature
formulation principle supreme law creed act according maxim whose universality law you same time will condition under will never come conflict itself [
interpretation first formulation called universalizability test
agent's maxim according kant subjective principle human actions agent believes reason act
universalisability test five steps find agent's maxim
action paired motivation
take example declaration will lie personal benefit
lying action motivation fulfill sort desire
paired together form maxim
imagine possible world everyone similar position real-world agent followed maxim
no exception one's self
order you hold people same principle required yourself
decide whether any contradictions irrationalities arise possible world result following maxim
contradiction irrationality arises acting maxim allowed real world
there no contradiction then acting maxim permissible sometimes required
modern parallel see john rawls' hypothetical situation original position
second formulation second formulation formula end itself holds rational being nature end thus end itself must serve every maxim condition restricting merely relative arbitrary ends
principle dictates you [a]ct reference every rational being whether yourself another end itself your maxim meaning rational being basis maxims action must treated never mere means supreme limiting condition use means
end same time
third formulation third formulation formula autonomy synthesis first two basis complete determination maxims
says maxims stem autonomous legislation ought harmonize possible realm ends realm nature
principle act your maxims should serve same time universal law rational beings meaning should act may think ourselves member universal realm ends legislating universal laws through our maxims code conduct possible realm ends
none may elevate themselves above universal law therefore one's duty follow maxims
religion within limits reason kant articulates strongest criticisms organization practices religious organizations those encourage sees religion counterfeit service god
among major targets criticism external ritual superstition hierarchical church order

nevertheless other interpreters consider kant trying mark off defensible rational core christian belief
kant sees jesus christ affirmation pure moral disposition heart make man well-pleasing god
idea freedom critique pure reason kant distinguishes transcendental idea freedom psychological concept mainly empirical refers question whether must admit power spontaneously beginning series successive things states real ground necessity regard causality practical concept freedom independence our will coercion necessitation through sensuous impulses
kant finds source difficulty practical idea freedom founded transcendental idea freedom sake practical interests uses practical meaning taking no account
transcendental meaning feels properly disposed third antinomy element question freedom will philosophy real stumbling-block embarrassed speculative reason
kant calls practical everything possible through freedom pure practical laws never given through sensuous conditions held analogously universal law causality moral laws

critique aesthetic judgment first major division critique judgment kant used term aesthetic manner according kant scholar w
walsh differs modern sense
prior critique pure reason note essential differences judgments taste moral judgments scientific judgments kant abandoned term aesthetic designating critique taste noting judgments taste never directed laws priori
baumgarten aesthetica 1750–58 kant first philosophers develop integrate aesthetic theory unified comprehensive philosophical system utilizing ideas played integral role throughout philosophy
chapter analytic beautiful critique judgment kant states beauty property artwork natural phenomenon instead consciousness pleasure attends 'free play' imagination understanding
even though appears using reason decide beautiful judgment cognitive judgment consequently logical aesthetical §
pure judgement taste fact subjective insofar refers emotional response subject based upon nothing esteem object itself disinterested pleasure feel pure judgements taste
judgements beauty lay claim universal validity §§20–22
important note universal validity derived determinate concept beauty common sense §40
kant also believed judgement taste shares characteristics engaged moral judgement both disinterested hold them universal
chapter analytic sublime kant identifies sublime aesthetic quality like beauty subjective unlike beauty refers indeterminate relationship faculties imagination reason shares character moral judgments use reason
feeling sublime itself officially divided two distinct modes mathematical dynamical sublime describes two subjective moments both concern relationship faculty imagination reason
commentators however argue kant's critical philosophy contains third kind sublime moral sublime aesthetic response moral law representation thereof development noble sublime kant's theory 1764
mathematical sublime situated failure imagination comprehend natural objects appear boundless formless appear absolutely great § 23–25
imaginative failure then recuperated through pleasure taken reason's assertion concept infinity

kant's political thought summarized republican government international organization
characteristically kantian terms doctrine state based upon law rechtsstaat eternal peace
indeed each these formulations both terms express same idea legal constitution 'peace through law'
taken simply itself kant's political philosophy being essentially legal doctrine rejects definition opposition moral education play passions alternate foundations social life
state defined union men under law
state rightly called constituted laws necessary priori because flow very concept law
regime judged no other criteria nor assigned any other functions those proper lawful order such
