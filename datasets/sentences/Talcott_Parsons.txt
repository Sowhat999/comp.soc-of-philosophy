put briefly very critical neo-classical theory attitude prevailed way through life reflected critique milton friedman gary becker

however agreed generally least up point their theoretical methodological style approach should discriminated substance
same reasons several other reasons addition unable accept institutionalist solution
interview late life parsons recalled conversation joseph schumpeter institutionalist methodological position following way economist like schumpeter contrast absolutely none

schutz fascinated parsons' theory regarded state-of-the-art social theory written evaluation parsons' theory kindly asked parsons comment
led short intensive correspondence generally revealed gap schutz's sociologized phenomenology parsons concept voluntaristic action far too great
parsons' point view schutz's position too speculative subjectivist nature felt schutz essentially philosopher tended reduce social processes articulation lebenswelt consciousness while parsons defining edge human life action catalyst historical change
parsons essential sociology science should pay strong attention subjective element action should never become completely absorbed since purpose science explain causal relationships whether covering laws other types explanatory devices
schutz's basic argument sociology cannot ground itself epistemology luxury necessity social scientist
parsons agreed stressed pragmatic need demarcate science philosophy insisted moreover grounding conceptual scheme empirical theory construction cannot aim absolute solutions need take sensible stock-taking epistemological balance each point time
however there no doubt two men shared many basic assumptions nature social theory kept debate simmering ever since

riesman prominent member american academic left influenced erich fromm frankfurt school
reality riesman's book academic attempt give credit concept mass society especially idea america suffocated social conformity
riesman essentially argued emerging highly advanced capitalism america basic value-system socializing roles change inner-directed toward other-directed pattern value-orientation
parsons white challenged riesman's idea argued there no change away inner-directed personality structure
while noticing riesman's other-directness look like caricature cooley's looking-glass self argued framework institutional individualism basic code-structure america's normative system essentially changed
happen however industrialized process increased pattern societal differentiation changed family's generalized symbolic function society allowed greater permissiveness way child related parents
however parsons white argued prelude greater otherdirectness complicated way inner-directed pattern situated itself social environment
political power concept influence 1963 1963 became notable year parsons's theoretical development because year published two important articles political power concept influence
two articles represented parsons's first published attempt work out idea generalized symbolic media integral part exchange processes within agil system
theoretical development parsons worked ever since publication economy society 1956
prime model generalized symbolic media money parsons reflecting question whether functional characteristics money represented exclusive uniqueness economic system whether possible identify other generalized symbolic media other subsystems well
although each medium unique characteristics parsons claimed power political system influence societal community institutional functions essentially structurally similar general systemic function money
utilizing roman jakobson's idea code message parsons divided components media question value-principle versus coordination standards code-structure question factor versus product control within those social process carried message components
way while utility regarded value-principle economy medium money effectiveness value-principle political system medium political power solidarity societal community medium influence

lloyd warner's structural approach social class laumann argued ethnicity religion perceived social class together play large role structuring community social networks
laumann's work found community networks highly partitioned along lines ethnicity religion occupational social status
also highlighted tension individuals experience their preference associate people like them homophily simultaneous desire affiliate higher-status others
later beginning career university chicago laumann argue how these impulses resolved individuals forms basis corporate competitive class consciousness within given community
addition demonstrating how community solidarity conceptualized social network role ethnicity religion class shaping such networks laumann's dissertation became first examples use population-based surveys collection social network data thus precursor decades egocentric social network analysis

first review article parsons analyzed bendix's work entitled embattled reason
parsons basically praised work's attempt defend basic values cognitive rationality defense parsons unconditionally shared agree bendix question cognitive rationality primarily cultural issue category reduced biologial economic social factors
however parsons problems way bendix proceed task especially felt bendix misrepresented work freud durkheim
parsons found real reason behind case misrepresentation lied way bendix tended conceive question systematic theorizing under concept reductionism
parsons further found bendix approach suffered conspicuous hostility toward idea evolution
true parsons assessed max weber rejected one-linear evolutionary approaches karl marx herbert spencer didn't follow weber rejected question evolution generalized question
second review article commentary reinhard bendix guenther roth scholarship partisanship essays max weber parsons continued line criticism
parsons especially concerned statement bendix bendix claimed weber subscriber karl marx's notion ideas epiphenomena organization production
parsons strongly rejected assessment
should contend certainly intellectual mature weber never hypothetical marxist
somewhere behind these attitudes bendix parsons detected discomport bendix behalf move out idiographic mode theorizing

turner called parsons symbolic interactionist
response parsons acknowledged action theory symbolic interactionism should regarded two separate antagonistic positions contrast overlapping structures conceptualization
parsons regarded symbolic interactionism theory george herbert mead valuable contributions action theory specifying certain aspects theory personality individual

parsons' approach differs essence niklas luhmann's theory because parsons rejects idea systems autopoietic short actual action-system individual actors
systems immanent capacities outcome institutionalized processes action-systems final analysis consists historical effort individual actors
while niklas luhmann became caught up sheer systemic immanence parsons insisted question autocatalytic homeostatic processes hand question actor ultimate first mover other mutually exclusive
homeostatic processes might necessary occur action necessitating
within perspective ultimate reference action parsons' dictum higher order cybernetic systems during course history will tend control social forms organized lower levels cybernetic hierarchy should understood

general theory important highlight parsons discriminates two meanings modes term general theory
purposes speaks general theory those aspects theoretical concerns field social sciences focus most constitutive elements cognitive concern basic theoretical systematization given field
within these concerns parsons include basic conceptual scheme given field including highest order theoretical relations naturally also necessary specification system's axiomatic epistemological methodological foundations point view logical implications
these elements signify quest general theory highest level theoretical concern
however term general theory also referred fully operational system system implications conceptual scheme spelled out lower levels cognitive structuralization levels standing closer perceived empirical object
speech american sociological society 1947 spoke five such levels
these levels following general theory level primarily took form theory social systems
theory motivation social behavior especially addressed questions dynamics social system naturally presupposed theories motivation personality socialization
theoretical bases systematic comparative analysis social structure example involve study concrete cultures concrete systems various levels generalization
special theories around particular empirical problem areas
fitting these theories specific empirical research techniques such statistics survey techniques
during life parsons work developing five fields theoretical concerns pay special attention development highest constitutive level since rest building stand fall solidity highest level
contrary prevailing myths parsons never thought modern societies exist kind perfect harmony their norms most modern societies necessary characterized high level consensus happy institutional integration
parsons highlighted two things regard
almost logically impossible there any perfect fit perfect consensus situation basic normative structure complex modern societies because basic value-pattern modern societies generally differentiated such way basic normative categories will exist inherent conflict each other actually then least potentially
example both freedom equality generally viewed fundamental sense non-negotiable values modern societies
each represents kind ultimate imperative higher values humanity
however parsons emphasizes there does exist any simple answer priority freedom versus equality any simple solution how possibly mediated
therefore modern societies faced inherent conflict prevailing these two values there no eternal solution such
reason alone there cannot exist any perfect match motivational pattern normative solutions prevailing value-pattern any modern society
parsons also maintain never-ending dispute left right something fact both defend ultimately justified human values ideals each their own terms indispensable values these fundamental values will exist endless conflictual position each other
general token parsons maintained integration normative pattern society problematic level integration reached principle far harmonious perfect
harmonious pattern does emerge then related specific historical circumstances general law social systems
agil paradigm heuristic scheme parsons used analyze systems subsystems called agil paradigm agil scheme
survive maintain equilibrium respect environment any system must degree adapt environment adaptation attain goals goal attainment integrate components integration maintain latent pattern latency pattern maintenance sort cultural template
these concepts abbreviated agil
these called system's functional imperatives
important understand parsons agil model analytical scheme sake theoretical production any simple copy any direct historical summary empirical reality
also scheme itself doesn't explain anything little periodical table natural sciences explains anything itself
agil scheme tool explanations no better quality those theories explanation processed

there however no single place parsons writing total agil system visually displayed explained—the complete system reconstructed multiple places writing
system displayed american university most basic elements should mistaken whole system
social evolutionism parsons contributed field social evolutionism neoevolutionism
divided evolution four sub-processes differentiation creates functional subsystems main system discussed above adaptation those systems evolve efficient versions inclusion elements previously excluded given systems generalization values increasing legitimization increasingly complex system
furthermore parsons explored these sub-processes within three stages evolution primitive archaic modern parsons viewed western civilisation pinnacle modern societies out western cultures declared united states most dynamically developed
parsons' late work focused new theoretical synthesis around four functions common claimed systems action—from behavioral cultural set symbolic media enable communication across them
attempt structure world action according scheme focused order unacceptable american sociologists time retreating grand pretensions 1960 s empirical grounded approach
pattern variables parsons asserted there two dimensions societies instrumental expressive
meant there qualitative differences kinds social interaction
observed people personalized formally detached relationships based roles play
characteristics associated each kind interaction called pattern variables
interaction characterized identifier each contrastive pair affectivity - affective neutrality self-orientation - collectivity-orientation universalism - particularism ascription - achievement specificity - diffusity influence legacy many years parsons best-known sociologist united states indeed most influential most controversial sociologists world
