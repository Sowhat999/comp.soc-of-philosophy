epistemology main article knowing known terminology problem fields epistemology logic partially due according dewey bentley inefficient imprecise use words concepts reflect three historic levels organization presentation
order chronological appearance these self-action prescientific concepts regarded humans animals things possessing powers their own initiated caused their actions
interaction described newton things living inorganic balanced against something system interaction example third law motion states every action there equal opposite reaction
transaction modern systems descriptions naming employed deal multiple aspects phases action without any attribution ultimate final independent entities essences realities
series characterizations transactions indicate wide range considerations involved
logic method dewey sees paradox contemporary logical theory
proximate subject matter garners general agreement advance while ultimate subject matter logic generates unremitting controversy
other words challenges confident logicians answer question truth logical operators
function merely abstractions e
pure mathematics connect essential way their objects therefore alter bring them light? grave dewey wife alcove north side ira allen chapel burlington vermont
grave university vermont campus logical positivism also figured dewey's thought
movement eschews use 'propositions' 'terms' substituting 'sentences' 'words'
general theory propositions logic theory inquiry welcomes changing referents far fixes attention upon symbolic structure content propositions
however registers small complaint against use sentence words without careful interpretation act process transposition narrows unduly scope symbols language since customary treat gestures diagrams maps blueprints etc
words sentences
other words sentences words considered isolation disclose intent may inferred adjudged means context
yet dewey entirely opposed modern logical trends
concerning traditional logic states aristotelian logic still passes current nominally logic based upon idea qualitative objects existential fullest sense

education teacher education main article democracy education dewey's educational theories presented my pedagogic creed 1897 school society 1900 child curriculum 1902 democracy education 1916 experience education 1938
several themes recur throughout these writings
dewey continually argues education learning social interactive processes thus school itself social institution through social reform should take place
addition believed students thrive environment allowed experience interact curriculum students should opportunity take part their own learning
ideas democracy social reform continually discussed dewey's writings education
dewey makes strong case importance education place gain content knowledge also place learn how live
eyes purpose education should revolve around acquisition pre-determined set skills rather realization one's full potential ability use those skills greater good

child curriculum 1902 dewey discusses two major conflicting schools thought regarding educational pedagogy
first centered curriculum focuses almost solely subject matter taught
dewey argues major flaw methodology inactivity student within particular framework child simply immature being matured superficial being deepened 1902 p
argues order education most effective content must presented way allows student relate information prior experiences thus deepening connection new knowledge
same time dewey alarmed many child-centered excesses educational-school pedagogues claimed followers argued too much reliance child equally detrimental learning process
second school thought must take our stand child our departure
subject-matter determines both quality quantity learning dewey 1902 p
according dewey potential flaw line thinking minimizes importance content well role teacher
order rectify dilemma dewey advocated educational structure strikes balance delivering knowledge while also taking account interests experiences student
notes child curriculum simply two limits define single process
just two points define straight line present standpoint child facts truths studies define instruction dewey 1902 p
through reasoning dewey became most famous proponents hands-on learning experiential education related synonymous experiential learning
argued knowledge comes impressions made upon us natural objects impossible procure knowledge without use objects impress mind dewey 1916/2009 pp
dewey's ideas went influence many other influential experiential models advocates

works john dewey provide most prolific examples how limited vocational view education applied both k-12 public education system teacher training schools attempted quickly produce proficient practical teachers limited set instructional discipline-specific skills needed meet needs employer demands workforce
school society dewey 1976 democracy education dewey 1980 dewey claims rather preparing citizens ethical participation society schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery facts disciplining bodies
rather preparing students reflective autonomous ethical beings capable arriving social truths through critical intersubjective discourse schools prepare students docile compliance authoritarian work political structures discourage pursuit individual communal inquiry perceive higher learning monopoly institution education dewey 1976 1980
dewey philosophical followers education stifles individual autonomy learners taught knowledge transmitted direction expert learner
dewey re-imagined way learning process should take place also role teacher should play within process

business teachers help producing many kinds skill needed contemporary life
teachers up their work also aid production character dewey tap 2010 p
according dewey emphasis placed producing these attributes children use their contemporary life because “impossible foretell definitely just civilization will twenty years now” dewey mpc 2010 p
however although dewey steadfast beliefs education serves immediate purpose dewey drt 2010 dewey mpc 2010 dewey ttp 2010 ignorant impact imparting these qualities intelligence skill character young children their present life will future society
while addressing state educative economic affairs during 1935 radio broadcast dewey linked ensuing economic depression “lack sufficient production intelligence skill character” dewey tap 2010 p

dewey notes there lack these goods present society teachers responsibility create them their students assume will grow adults will ultimately go participate whatever industrial economical civilization awaits them
according dewey profession classroom teacher produce intelligence skill character within each student democratic community composed citizens think act intelligently morally
teacher's knowledge dewey believed successful classroom teacher possesses passion knowledge intellectual curiosity materials methods teach
dewey propensity inherent curiosity love learning differs one’s ability acquire recite reproduce textbook knowledge
no according dewey really successful performing duties meeting these demands [of teaching] does retain [her] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [her] entire career dewey apt 2010 p
according dewey “teacher ought strive high-class scholar subjects she teach” rather “a teacher ought unusual love aptitude subject history mathematics literature science fine art whatever” dewey apt 2010 p
classroom teacher does scholar subjects rather genuine love will elicit feel genuine information insight subjects taught
addition propensity study subjects taught classroom teacher “is possessed recognition responsibility constant study school room work constant study children methods subject matter various adaptations pupils” dewey pst 2010 p
dewey desire lifelong pursuit learning inherent other professions e
architectural legal medical fields dewey 1904 & dewey pst 2010 particular importance field teaching
dewey notes “this further study side line something fits directly demands opportunities vocation” dewey apt 2010 p
according dewey propensity passion intellectual growth profession must accompanied natural desire communicate one’s knowledge others
“there scholars [the knowledge] marked degree lack enthusiasm imparting
‘natural born’ teacher learning incomplete unless shared” dewey apt 2010 p
dewey enough classroom teacher lifelong learner techniques subject-matter education she must aspire share she knows others her learning community
teacher's skill best indicator teacher quality according dewey ability watch respond movement mind keen awareness signs quality responses her students exhibit regard subject-matter presented dewey apt 2010 dewey 1904
dewey notes often asked how teachers never studied art teaching still extraordinarily good teachers
explanation simple
quick sure unflagging sympathy operations process minds contact
their own minds move harmony those others appreciating their difficulties entering their problems sharing their intellectual victories dewey apt 2010 p
such teacher genuinely aware complexities mind mind transfer she intellectual fortitude identify successes failures process well how appropriately reproduce correct future
teacher's disposition result direct influence teachers shaping mental moral spiritual lives children during their most formative years dewey holds profession teaching high esteem often equating social value ministry parenting dewey apt 2010 dewey drt 2010 dewey mpc 2010 dewey pst 2010 dewey ttc 2010 dewey ttp 2010
perhaps most important attributes according dewey those personal inherent qualities teacher brings classroom
dewey notes no amount learning even acquired pedagogical skill makes up deficiency dewey tls p
25 personal traits needed most successful profession
according dewey successful classroom teacher occupies indispensable passion promoting intellectual growth young children
addition she knows her career comparison other professions entails stressful situations long hours limited financial reward potential overcome her genuine love sympathy her students
dewey most depressing phases vocation number care worn teachers sees anxiety depicted lines their faces reflected their strained high pitched voices sharp manners
while contact young privilege temperaments tax others tax bear up under very well
schools there too many pupils teacher too many subjects teach adjustments pupils made mechanical rather human way
human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions dewey apt 2101 p
essential according dewey classroom teacher mental propensity overcome demands stressors placed her because students sense their teacher genuinely invested promoting their learning dewey pst 2010
such negative demeanors according dewey prevent children pursuing their own propensities learning intellectual growth
therefore assumed teachers want their students engage educational process employ their natural curiosities knowledge teachers must aware how their reactions young children stresses teaching influence process
role teacher education cultivate professional classroom teacher dewey’s passions teaching—a natural love working young children natural propensity inquire subjects methods other social issues related profession desire share acquired knowledge others—are set outwardly displayed mechanical skills
rather may viewed internalized principles habits “work automatically unconsciously” dewey 1904 p
according dewey teacher education programs must turn away focusing producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related instruction discipline e
creating delivering lesson plans classroom management implementation assortment content-specific methods learned over time during their everyday school work their students dewey pst 2010
dewey notes teacher leaves professional school power managing class children may appear superior advantage first day first week first month even first year compared other teacher much vital command psychology logic ethics development
later ‘progress’ may such consist perfecting refining skill already possessed
such persons seem know how teach students teaching
even though go studying books pedagogy reading teachers’ journals attending teachers’ institutes etc
yet root matter them unless continue students subject-matter students mind-activity
unless teacher such student may continue improve mechanics school management cannot grow teacher inspirer director soul-life dewey 1904 p
dewey teacher education should focus producing persons know how teach soon leave program rather teacher education should concerned producing professional students education propensity inquire subjects teach methods used activity mind gives receives knowledge
according dewey such student superficially engaging these materials rather professional student education genuine passion inquire subjects education knowing doing ultimately leads acquisitions skills related teaching
such students education aspire intellectual growth within profession achieved immersing one’s self lifelong pursuit intelligence skills character dewey linked profession
dewey notes other professional fields such law medicine cultivate professional spirit their fields constantly study their work their methods their work perpetual need intellectual growth concern issues related their profession
teacher education profession these same obligations dewey 1904 dewey pst 2010
dewey notes intellectual responsibility got distributed every human being concerned carrying out work question attempt concentrate intellectual responsibility work done their brains their hearts hundreds thousands people dozen top no matter how wise skillful concentrate responsibility--it diffuse irresponsibility dewey pst 2010 p
