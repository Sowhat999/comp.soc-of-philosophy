1921 guénon published introduction study hindu doctrines
goal writes attempt presenting westerners eastern metaphysics spirituality understood thought easterners themselves while pointing rené guénon describes erroneous interpretations misunderstandings western orientalism neospiritualism latter notably proponents madame blavatsky's theosophism
right time presents rigorous understanding hindu doctrines also eastern metaphysics general
managed expose these doctrines western public viewed quite unprepared unreceptive whole
departed standard scholarship orientalist terminology methods preferred expose doctrines simple easterner devoid called western prejudices
most famous aspects rené guénon's work irreducible difference describes east west
rené guénon defines eastern metaphysics intellectuality universal nature opens possibilities conception truly beyond any limitation
work comprises exposition fundamental metaphysical principles introduction study hindu doctrines contains general definition term tradition guénon defines man becoming according vedânta symbolism cross multiple states being metaphysical principles infinitesimal calculus oriental metaphysics
studies symbolism comprising many articles journal le voile d'isis became later known under name etudes traditionnelles
these studies symbolism later compiled michel valsan posthumous book symbols sacred science
studies great triad traditional forms & cosmic cycles insights islamic esoterism & taoism king world alternately translated lord world also mostly symbolism

partition strict guénon's works display coherence unity making each book integrally related others
perspective according rené guénon's own words work completely unrelated any particular philosophical system
identifies main difference profane sacred knowledge former ignores notion realisation moksha delivrance hindu doctrines while latter provides effective means realizing supreme principle through initiation mantra dhikr recitation orthodox spiritual lineages
guénon defines modern world being degeneration calls traditional world
according real separation east west comes degeneration other words comes intellectual standpoint related any geographical distinction doctrinal divergence
amidst global period intellectual confusion disorder characterizes modernity according rené guénon east maintained alive through uninterrupted spiritual lineages intellectual possibly hidden elite fully conscious original wisdom transmitted humanity time immemorial
books states present condition humanity explained traditional doctrine cosmic cycles described hindu doctrines

therein denounces calls pseudo-initiation according spreading since end 19 th century
intends denounce through careful examination historical origin ideological evolution taken calls their pseudo-doctrines pseudo-spiritual organisations according expose west false eastern doctrines counterfeits regular initiatic traditions among these pseudo-spiritual associations makes particular mention theosophical society founded madame blavatsky wake modern pseudo-rosicrucian organisations late 19 th century
guénon exposits view metaphysics according no means reduced scientific philosophical conceptions instead knowledge
principles universal order being absolutely illimited metaphysics cannot defined
metaphysics seen according etymological sense while recalling sense books
such metaphysics being essence beyond any contingency necessarily source orthodox traditions these latter being considered direct derivations great primordial tradition corresponding hindu notion sanātana dharma laws manu
metaphysics introduced rené guénon branch philosophy western studies
traditional metaphysics according guénon beyond any contingency knowledge universal principles lies very source orthodox legitimate traditions making connection heart these traditions unique spiritual origin primordial tradition
study traditional metaphysics relationship our state existence
our world clears path inwardly towards center common shared each authentic religion exoterism bounds outside accessible everyone purpose maintain link supreme principle
however current state west characterized voluntary gradual detachment own tradition christianity degeneration major branches last initiatic organization freemasonry makes restoration somewhat unlikely feasible given situation result long evolution through western history according guénon follows even predetermined plan
incidentally esoteric domain rené guénon says two dates mark historically fundamental spiritual degeneration west first destruction order knights templar 1314 defines precisely rené guénon called modern deviation treaty westphalia 1648 severed historical outer realm link west rené guénon defined supreme centre
multiple occasions books rené guénon insisted most important metaphysics properly inexpressible should agreed altering truth partial restrictive systematized exposition keep part inexpressible ie part cannot emprisonned any form metaphysically really matters most even say represents most essential part according doctrine exposed guénon spiritual realisation leads effective identification states being superior our transitory human state ultimately supreme identity supreme principle absolute reality

introduction study hindu doctrines book published 1921 topics will included lecture will give sorbonne december 17 1925 oriental metaphysics consists four parts
first part preliminary questions exposes hurdles prevented classical orientalism deep understanding eastern doctrines without forgetting rené guénon course view orientalism time classical prejudice consists essentially predisposition attribute origin civilization greeks romans ignorance certain types relationships ancient peoples linguistic difficulties confusions arising certain questions related chronology these confusions being made possible through ignorance importance oral transmission precede considerable indeterminate extent written formulation

introduction study hindu doctrines among objectives purpose giving proper intellectual basis promote openness study eastern intellectuality
study hindu doctrines continued book man becoming according vêdantâ taking specific viewpoint human being's constitution according vêdantâ rené guénon states goal present synthetic exposition vedic doctrines quite impossible task consider particular point doctrine case definition human being order contemplate afterwards other aspects metaphysics
book begins precising nature vêdantâ profound signification end vedas traditional signification shruti smriti scriptures distinction shruti smriti fundamentally equivalent immediate intellectual intuition reflective consciousness first described word bearing primitive meaning 'hearing' precisely order indicate intuitive character because according hindu cosmological doctrine sound holds primordial rank among sensible qualities
fundamental texts called mimânsa pûrva-mimânsa uttara-mimânsa upanishads brahmâ-sûtras along hindu cosmological texts listed notion intellectual function associated their origin proposed opposed profane notion author
general considerations self unmanifested universal manifestation then introduced universal manifestation exists development constantly being progress towards destiny
unmanifested beyond universal manifestation designated negation
second chapter also establishes fundamental distinctions self ego personality individuality first being absolutely real
these ideas declined different denominations depending first part different degrees reality considered also transcendent immanent point views contemplated ishwara divine personality principle universal manifestation
unmanifested principle manifestation cannot itself manifested relation symbolism black heads ishwara head darkness
atmâ paramâtmâ brahmâ realization self relation any being whatsoever reality identical atmâ constitutes heart hindu doctrine delivrance moksha doctrine absolutely identical islamic esoterism calls supreme identity say expressed hindu terms identity atmâ brahmâ 'supreme identity' according expression borrowed islamic esoterism doctrine many other points fundamentally same hindu tradition spite great differences form
supreme identity moksha delivrance made possible through realization because very heart human being confused heart organ corporeal envelope found called brahmâ 's journey brahmâ-pura
resides center human state purusha brahmâ considered inside center human being
purusha order manifestation may produced must enter correlation another principle although such correlation really non-existent relation highest uttama aspect purusha there cannot truth any other principle supreme principle except relative sense
correlative purusha then prakriti undifferentiated primordial substance passive principle represented feminine while purusha also called pumas active principle represented masculine these two poles manifestation though remaining unmanifested themselves
union these complementary principles produces integral development human individual state applies relatively each individual
man becoming according vedânta p
there different degrees individual manifestation described named particular tanmatras mind manas role coordinator internal external faculties five vayus different prânas distinctions waking state dream state deep sleep state
book ends description reabsorption individual faculties either posthumous conditions spiritual process realization up final delivrance supreme identity ultimate goal any true spiritual path
symbolism cross symbolism cross book dedicated venerated memory esh-sheikh abder-rahman elish el-kebir
goal guénon states explain symbol common almost traditions fact seem indicate direct attachment great primordial tradition
alleviate hurdles bound interpretations symbol belonging different traditions guénon distinguishes synthesis syncretism syncretism consists assembling outside number less incongruous elements regarded never truly unified
syncretism something outward elements taken any quarters put together way never amount anything borrowings effectively incapable being integrated doctrine worthy name
apply these criteria present context symbolism cross syncretism recognized wherever finds elements borrowed different traditional forms assembled together without any awareness there single doctrine these forms many different expressions many adaptations related particular conditions related given circumstances time place
notable example syncretism found according guénon doctrines symbols theosophical society
synthesis other hand carried essentially within properly consists envisaging things unity their principle
synthesis will exist starts unity itself never loses sight throughout multiplicity manifestations moreover implies ability see beyond forms awareness principal truth
given such awareness liberty make use another those forms something certain traditions symbolically denote gift tongues
concordance traditional forms may represent genuine synonymies
particular rené guénon writes cross symbol various forms met almost everywhere most remotes times
therefore far belonging peculiarly christian tradition cross like any other traditional symbol regarded according manifold senses
far being absolute complete unity himself individual reality constitutes relative fragmentary unity
multiplicity states being fundamental metaphysical truth implies effective realization being's multiple states related conception various traditional doctrines including islamic esoterism denote term 'universal man' arabic al-insân-al-kâmil same time 'primordial man' al-insân-al-qâdim adam qadmon hebrew kabbalah also 'king' wang far-eastern tradition tao te king chap
conception 'universal man' establishes constitutive analogy universal manifestation individual human modality use language western hermeticism 'macrocosm' 'microcosm'
these considerations geometrical symbolism cross most universal signification contemplated most traditional doctrines symbolize realization 'universal man' sign everywhere same because according guénon those directly attached primordial tradition
sign sign cross very clearly represents manner achievement realization perfect communion states being harmoniously conformably ranked integral expansion double sense amplitude exaltation
fact double expansion being may regarded taking place horizontally hand certain level degree existence vertically other hierarchical superimposition degrees
thus horizontal direction represents amplitude integral extension individuality taken basis realization vertical direction represents hierarchy likewise fortiori indefinite multiples states
furthermore symbol cross also considered two basic ways so-called horizontal vertical appears double consideration first cross obtained ecliptic plane joining equinoctial solstice points second cross orthogonal first defined equator line going through poles
tridimensional cross obtained way linked six directions space centre cross through symbolism appears notably hebraic kabbalah relation mystery unity also clement alexandria hindu doctrines well
then symbol cross may develop according different points view union complements vertical line representing active principle horizontal line passive principle hence establishing application general consideration purusha-prakriti resolution opposites symbolized central point corresponds islamic esoterism calls divine station namely combines contrasts antinomies al-mâqam lillahi huwa mâqam ijtima 'al-diddâin station mâqam degree being's effective realization attained al-fanâ' extinction ego return primordial state such extinction writes rené guénon even regards literal meaning term denoting without analogy nirvâna buddhist doctrine
beyond al-fanâ' there still fanâ al-fanâ' extinction extinction similarly corresponds parinirvâna
far-eastern tradition central point called invariable middle ching-yin place perfect equilibrium represented center 'cosmic wheel' also same time point 'activity heaven' directly manifested
center directs things actionless activity wei wu wei although unmanifested rather because unmanifested reality plenitude activity since activity principle whence activities derived guénon notes expressed lao tzu follows principle actionless yet everything done
invariable middle also locus peace void corresponding islamic esoterism calls great peace
'peace' dwells central point brings another symbolism namely war well-known example symbolism writes rené guénon found bhagavad-gitâ
same conception writes rené guénon specific hindu doctrine also found islamic real meaning 'holy war' jihâd war represents cosmic process whereby manifested reintegrated principal unity why viewpoint manifestation itself reintegration appears destruction emerges very clearly certain aspects symbolism shiva hindu doctrine
another aspect symbolism cross identifies various traditions identifies tree midst numerous symbols world axis
tree stands center world rather world domain state existence such human state developed
biblical symbolim example 'tree life' planted midst terrestrial paradise represents center our world rené guénon studies relationships another biblical tree 'tree knowledge good evil'
besides horizontal cross directly relation polar symbolism swastika truly universal symbol represents particularly india action principle manifestation no way related artificial even anti-traditional use swastika german 'racialists' given fantastic somewhat ridiculous title hakenkreuz 'hanked cross' quite arbitrarily made symbol antisemitism
then rené guénon goes deeply possible geometrical symbolism applies equally both degrees universal existence states each being both 'macrocosmic' 'microcosmic'standpoint
these considerations lead interpretation symbolism weaving sanskrit sûtra means thread least curious note arabic word sûrat denotes chapters koran composed exactly same elements sanskrit sûtra word addition kindred sense 'row' 'line' derivation unknown
rené guénon then contemplates many aspects related geometrical representation states being representation continuity modalities same state being relationship point space question related infinitesimals ontology burning bush old testament universal spherical vortex far-eastern symbol yin-yang tree serpent etc
multiple states being narayana names vishnu hindu tradition signifies literally walks waters evident parallel gospel tradition
surface waters their plane separation described plane reflection celestial ray
marks state passage individual universal operative well-known symbol walking waters represents emancipation form liberation individual condition rené guénon multiples states being chapter 12 two chaoses
book expands multiple states being doctrine already tackled symbolism cross leaving aside geometrical representation exposed book bring out full range altogether fundamental theory
first foremost asserted necessity metaphysical infinity envisaged relationship universal possibility
infinite according etymology term designates no limits applied absolutely no limit exempted certain limitations while being subjected others like space time quantity other words countless other things fall within indefinite fate nature
there no distinction infinite universal possibility simply correlation these terms indicates case infinite contemplated active aspect while universal possibility refers passive aspect these two aspects brahma shakti hindu doctrines
results distinction possible real [
no metaphysical validity every possible real way according mode befitting own nature
leads metaphysical consideration being non-being [
define being universal sense principle manifestation same time comprising itself totality possibilities manifestation must say being infinite because does coincide total possibility because being principle manifestation although does indeed comprise possibilities manifestation does insofar actually manifested
outside being therefore rest possibilities non-manifestation well possibilities manifestation themselves insofar unmanifested state included among these being itself cannot belong manifestation since principle thereof consequence itself unmanifested
want any other term obliged designate thus outside beyond being non-being us negative term no way synonym 'nothingness'
instance our present state corporeal modality defined five conditions space time matter
quantity form life these five conditions enter correlation five corporeal elements bhutas hindu doctrine see below create living forms including us our corporeal modalities our world state existence
universal manifestation incommensurably vast including states existence correspond other conditions possibilities yet being itself principle universal manifestation
involves foundation theory multiple states metaphysical notion unicity existence wahdatul-wujûd instance developed islamic esoterism mohyddin ibn arabi
relationships unity multiplicity lead accurate description non-being there no question multiplicity states since domain essentially undifferentiated even unconditionned undifferentiated cannot exist distinctive mode although still speak analogously states non-manifestation non-being metaphysical zero logically anterior unity why hindu doctrine speaks regard non duality advaita
analogous considerations drawn study dream state help understand relationships unity multiplicity dream state modalities manifestation human being corresponding subtle non-corporeal part individuality being produces world proceeds entirely itself objects therein consist exclusively mental images opposed sensory perceptions waking state say combinations ideas clothed subtle forms depend substantially subtle form individual himself moreover imaginal objects dream nothing accidental secondary modifications
then rené guénon studies possibilities individual consciousness mental mind characteristic element human individuality
chapter x limits indefinite comes back notion metaphysical realization moksha suprême identity
superior signification notion darkness then introduced most notably chapter entitled two chaoses describes happening during course spiritual realization disciple leaves domain formal possibilities
multiples states being essentially related notion spiritual hierarchies found traditions
hence described universal process realization being through knowledge
initiation hermes' caduceus example symbol associated possession lesser mysteries showing example horizontal duality two snakes' heads placed horizontal dual position hence referring apparent dualities such life death

perspectives initiation first published close world war ii 1946 extends series articles central subject initiation originally written 1932 1938 le voile d'isis later renamed etudes traditionnelles

while notion initiation introduced most general setting impossible writes guénon write complete comprehensive book subject indefinite number questions raised very nature subject resisting any set limit
however subject initiation being contemplated general point view goal rené guénon goes beyond introduction subject doing make clear distinctions relevant initiation according guénon

case initiation contrary individual source initiative towards 'realization' pursued methodically under rigorous unremitting control normally reaching beyond very possibilities individual such
other writings metaphysics hermeticism cosmological sciences lesser greater mysteries main article perspectives initiation hindu doctrine cosmic cycles guénon introduces preliminary aspects particular extremely complex cosmological science hindu doctrine cosmic cycles instance article remarks doctrine cosmic cycles
writes giving overview theory equivalents different traditional forms merely impossible task because question very complex itself specially owing extreme difficulty expressing these things european language way intelligible present-day western mentality no practice whatsoever kind thinking
possible respect clarify few points remarks raise suggestions meaning doctrine question rather really explaining
most general sense term cycle must considered representing process development state manifestation case minor cycles less restricted specialized modalities state
moreover virtue law correspondence links things universal existence there necessarily certain analogy either among different cycles same order among principal cycles their secondary divisions
allows use same mode expression speaking cycles although must often understood symbolically allude here especially 'chronological' form under doctrine cycles presented since kalpa represents total development world say state degree universal existence obvious cannot speak literally duration computed according temporal measure unless duration relates state time determination our world
everywhere else duration purely symbolic must transposed analogically temporal succession image both logical ontological 'extra-temporal' series causes effects
inside kalpa manvantaras eras successive manus 14 number forming two septenary series first includes both past manvantaras present second future manvantaras present humanity seventh manvantara kalpa
these two series linked those seven svargas seven patalas point view hierarchy degrees existence universal manifestation represent states respectively higher lower human state
another correspondence concerns seven dvīpa devnagari वीप 'regions' world divided
although according proper meaning word designates them these represented islands continents distributed certain way space must careful take literally regard them simply different parts present-day earth guénon writes 'emerge' turns simultaneously them manifested sensible domain over course certain period
period manvantara will conclude each dvīpa will appear twice kalpa once each just mentioned septenary series correspond another inversely similar cases particularly svargas patalas deduce order appearance dvīpa will likewise second series inverse first matter different 'states' terrestrial world rather 'regions' properly speaking
jambudvīpa really represents entire earth present state corporeal modality extend south meru 'axial' mountain around our world revolves because meru identified symbolically north pole whole earth really situated south respect
explain completely necessary develop symbolism directions space according dvīpas distributed well correspondences existing spatial symbolism temporal symbolism whole doctrine cycles rest
way envisaging dvīpas writes rené guénon also confirmed concordant data other traditions also speak 'seven lands' particularly islamic esoterism hebrew kabbalah
thus latter even while these 'seven lands' outwardly represented many divisions land canaan related reigns 'seven kings edom' clearly correspond seven manus first series included 'land living' represents complete development our world considered realized permanently principal state
note here coexistence two points view succession refers manifestation itself other simultaneity refers principle call 'archetype' root correspondence these two points view certain way equivalent temporal symbolism spatial symbolism just alluded connection dvīpas hindu tradition
islamic esoterism 'seven lands' appear perhaps even explicitly many tabaqāt 'categories' terrestrial existence coexist way interpenetrate presently accessible senses while others latent state perceived exceptionally under special conditions these too manifested outwardly turn during different periods succeed another course total duration world
other hand each 'seven lands' governed qutb 'pole' thus corresponds very clearly manu period during land manifested these seven aktab subordinated supreme 'pole' just different manus subordinate adi-manu primordial manu because these 'seven lands' coexist also certain respect exercise their functions permanent simultaneous way
hardly necessary writes guénon point out designation 'pole' closely related polar symbolism meru
meru itself any case exact equivalent mountain qāf islamic tradition
seven terrestrial 'poles' considered reflections seven celestial 'poles' preside respectively over seven planetary heavens naturally evokes correspondence svargas hindu doctrine shows sum perfect concordance regard two traditions
yugas divisions manvantara four number correspond spatial symbolism four cardinal points
there obvious equivalence four yugas four ages gold silver bronze iron greco-latin antiquity
guénon writes figures given durations yugas various indian texts taken symbolically their actual exact determination needs in-depth specific knowledge these numbers often written various traditional reasons undetermined number zeros added their transcription
guénon gives indications determination yuga's durations total duration manvantara represented 10 then durations four yugas krita yuga satya yuga 4 corresponding 25920 years
treta yuga 3 19440 years
dvapara yuga 2 12960 years
kali yuga 6480 years
division manvantara carried out formula 10 = 4 + 3 + 2 + reverse pythagorean tetraktys
last formula corresponds language western hermeticism calls 'the circling square' other opposite problem 'squaring circle' expresses precisely relation end cycle beginning integration total development
guénon writes presently advanced phase kali yuga
science letters islam name allāh

numerical value word allāh + 30 + 30 + 5 = 66
effective totalization being called 'moksha' 'delivrance' hindu doctrines 'universal man' islamic esoterism latter represented couple 'adam-eve' adam wa hawwa same number 66 allāh may taken means expressing 'supreme identity' symbolism cross chapter 3

subject esoterism relations islamic doctrine refers arabic words tariqah haqiqah means end notes general meaning esoterism designated term taṣawwūf

while 'taṣawwūf' refers any esoteric initiatic doctrine questions [derivative] term 'sufism' designate islamic esoterism
guénon writes term unfortunate disadvantage inevitably suggesting 'ism' suffix idea doctrine proper particular school whereas case reality schools question being turuq basically represent different methods without there being any possibility fundamental difference doctrine 'the doctrine unity unique' at-tawhidu wahid
· according guénon derivation word sūfi undoubtedly unsolvable word having too many proposed etymologies equal plausibility true

true sūfi therefore possesses wisdom other words al-'arif bi' llah say 'he knows through god' god cannot known except himself supreme 'total' degree knowledge haqiqah
guénon then introduces symbolism used taṣawwūf numerical significaton arabic letters divine 'throne' surrounds worlds al-arsh al-muhit represented figure circle

classical atomism continuum 'naturalistic' tendencies never developed took extension india greece under influence physical philosophers
particular atomism modern sense atoms elementary particles classical signification related existence indivisible items entire corporeal world supposedly built conception formally opposed veda notably connection theory five elements
classical atomism states atom anu partakes potentially least nature other elements grouping together atoms various kinds under action force 'non perceptible' adrishta bodies supposed formed
error atomism comes fact these atoms supposed exist within corporeal order whereas bodily necessarily composite being divisible fact extended say subject spatial condition although corporeal domain divisibility necessarily limits
order find something simple indivisible necessary pass outside space therefore outside special modality manifestation constitutes corporeal existence
devanagari aum
true sense 'indivisible' writes guénon atom having no parts must without extension sum elements devoid extension never form extension atoms cannot make up bodies
guénon also reproduces argument coming shankaracharya refutation atomism two things come contact another either part themselves whole atoms devoid parts first hypothesis inadmissible thus second hypothesis remains amounts saying aggregation two atoms realized their coincidence [

guénon introduces term 'counter-initiation' describe 'counter-initiation' [
cannot regarded purely human invention such no way distinguishable nature plain 'pseudo-initiation' fact much order may really must certain sense far actual origin concerned proceed unique source initiation attached very source speaking generally anything our world manifests 'non-human' element proceeds 'counter-initiation' proceeds source degeneration carried extreme limits limit represented 'inversion' constitutes 'satanism' properly so-called
historical origin counter-initiation carries writing however obscure question origin may there plausibility idea may connected perversion ancient civilizations belonging another continents disappeared cataclysms occurring course present manvantara
while making precision note sixth chapter genesis might perhaps provide symbolical form indications relating distant origins 'counter-initiation'
order imitation inverted reflection may complete possible centers likely established organizations appertaining 'counter-initiation' will attached
guénon writes these centers will course purely 'psychic' like influences use transmit no sense spiritual like centers initiation true tradition will able [
assume up point outward appearance spiritual centers thus producing illusion characteristic 'inverted spirituality'
these centers depicted symbolical form ancient eastern legends such legend seven towers devil
awliyâ esh-shaytân constitution these seven centers claim oppose influence seven aqtâb poles subordinate supreme pole although such opposition illusory spiritual realm necessarily closed 'counter-initiation'
guénon gave indications geographical localization these towers distribution certainly no matter chance

guénon distinguishes two phases action 'counter-initiation' first being purely negative devoted destruction everything authentically traditional human realm phase culminated kind materialism called 'integral'
latter phase preparatory destined followed toward setting up something appropriately called 'counter-tradition' yet come before end kali-yuga
these two phases contemplated guénon using symbolism solve & coagula taken alchemy
'counter-tradition' role played 'counter-initiation' referred guénon following terms after having worked shadows inspire direct invisibly modern movements will end contrive 'exteriorize' right word something will counterpart true tradition least completely exactly within limitations necessarily inherent possible counterfeits such
false spirituality term refers also beings involved 'counter-initiation' engaged 'inverted realization' lose themselves way end extreme cases last total 'disintegration' conscious being final dissolution thus realizing inverse effacement 'ego' before 'self' others words realizing confusion 'chaos' against fusion principal unity
finality conclusive represents exceptional case awliyâ esh-shaytân goal 'counter-tradition' will divert many possible true spiritual path
'neo-spiritualism' 'pseudo-initiation' proceeding writes guénon partial 'prefiguration' 'counter-tradition' notably their utilization elements authentically traditional their origin perverted their true meaning
perversion move direction complete reversal must characterize 'counter-tradition'
false spirituality should expressed according rené guénon even social field through establishment counter-order opposed traditional notion sanctum regnum whose motto ordo ab chao run unprecedented scale human history according traditional data
such counter-order will appear guénon writes modern social concepts human organization inherited first phase antitraditional action such egalitarism other similar ideals will abandoned favor setting up counter-elite reintroduction counter-values will form social basis 'counter-tradition'
symbolism itself will subverted counter-initiation through subversion inherent double meanings constitutive elements according complex notion exposited chapter 30 reign quantity signs times

certain sense both there will collectivity will appear 'exteriorization' 'counter-initiatic' organization itself finally appears light day there must also person will head collectivity such most complete expression even very 'incarnation' will represent capacity 'support' malefic influences will first concentrate himself then project onto world
