written book lokayata study ancient indian materialism against old fashioned conception india land dreamers mystics
study questioned mainstream view indian philosophy's sole concern concept brahman
scattered references ancient philosophical literature completely hostile ancient materialist schools debiprasad chattopadhyaya reconstructed philosophy lokayata consistently denied existence brahman viewed pratyaksa perception sole means knowledge
demolished so-called interpretation synthesis sought combine diverse philosophical traditions india form ladder leads philosophy advaita vedanta
being marxist chattopadhyaya's uses method historical materialism study ultimate material basis primitive deha-vada primitive rituals related reveal how these connected mode securing material means subsistence
also traced course development archaic outlook eventually underwent
indian philosophy popular outline 1964 probably first introductory book examined indian philosophy through interdisciplinary approach drawing anthropological economic philological studies
book traced philosophical development india vedic period later buddhism
introductory study debiprasad chattopadhyaya targets another important myth overshadows study indian philosophy presupposed predominance shastrartha textual interpretation
views development indian philosophy consequence real clashes ideas contradiction constituted moving force behind indian philosophical development
dale riepe review book says chattopadhyaya combines analytic sagacity hume impatient realism lenin
indian atheism marxist analysis 1969 yet another provocative critique standard accounts indian philosophy religion
book brings out coherent historical account atheism india
fact according chattopadhyaya unbiased survey vedas clearly shows total absence religious consciousness earlier stage rgveda full relics stage thought
even world polytheism misapplied such early stage vedic thought
living dead indian philosophy 1976 main article living dead indian philosophy preface debiprasad chattopadhyaya says purpose book present analysis our philosophical traditions standpoint our present philosophical requirements
these requirements understood here secularism rationalism science-orientation
once again finds philosophical development debates clashes ancient india embedded class struggles time
discusses materialist foundation vedic rituals finds similar magical belief controlling natural forces through yajnas etc
shows how these rites rituals evolved primitive scientific endeavours transformed superstitions monopolies hands oppressors advent class divisions
book also endeavours demonstrate how indian philosophy any exception sharp conflicts idealism materialism universally evident philosophical traditions other regions
further considers role law-givers like manu establishing supremacy idealist traditions how due censor censure anti-idealists like varahamihira brahmagupta worked out their philosophies distinctive aesopian language developing their own modes camouflaging their ideas
like elsewhere india too anti-idealists materialists took practice main criterion truth
nyaya-vaisheshikas most outspoken regard after knowledge proved true practice there remains no doubt proof hence question proving does arise
other hand idealists believed complete separation theory practice
adhered words kumarila bhatta principle bahyartha-sunyatva unreality objects knowledge according debiprasad chattopadhyaya formed real pivot idealism throughout indian career
science society ancient india 1977 book scientific method ancient india how societal divisions time shaped development science
debiprasad chattopadhyaya chooses field medicine purpose because according discipline promises fully secular contains clear potentials modern understanding natural science medicine
main concentration book present analysis caraka samhita crucial source book indian medicine
according chattopadhyaya discarding scripture orientation [the indian physicians] insist supreme importance direct observation natural phenomena technique rational processing empirical data
go even extent claiming truth any conclusion thus arrived tested ultimately criterion practice
them everything nature occurs according immutable laws body usually called svabhava indian thought medical viewpoint there nothing made matter
even say substance called conscious endowed sense-organs
further chattopadhyaya shows anywhere ancient indian thought permitted see real anticipation view knowledge power further worked out assumes formulation freedom recognition necessity found among practitioners healing art
chattopadhyaya also tries show book how societal divisions especially caste system enforced law-givers their justificatory idealist ideologies formed obstructions way scientific development india
lenin philosopher 1979 book written context growing state authoritarianism during indian emergency declared indira gandhi hand upsurge rightist forces form jan sangh shiv sena etc
chattopadhyaya opined these grim anxious days through india today passing holds hope our future growing awareness our people socialism being way out
essential pre-condition moving forward socialism consolidation socialist consciousness right sense among indians today imperative understand absorb philosophical views lenin
book meant guide introduction lenin's philosophical writings
seeks lead readers actual study lenin providing them clarifications annotations summations may useful limited preliminary acquaintance lenin's philosophical ideas
however communist leader e
namboodiripad overall appreciative review book criticised chattopadhyaya explaining sufficiently convincing way why lenin thought necessary go hegel later years evident philosophical notebooks 1914
reception gerald larson sees chattopadhyaya's writings ancient indian philosophies most interesting sustained marxist interpretation indian thought
reviewing chattopadhyaya's writings samkhya philosophy observes chattopadhyaya proceeds reconstruct original samkhya position claiming classical notion include purusha most important notion samkhya prakrti citing pre-vedic tantra traditions matriarchal society foundation original samkhya
disagreeing conclusion chattopadhyaya says argue
archaic agricultural-matriarchal tradition mother-right pastoral-patriarchal tradition male dominance then trace direct one-to-one correlation samkhya materialism former vedanta idealism latter clearly oversimplification reflects chattopadhyaya's political ideology does india's ancient cultural heritage
concluding review larson avers begins refreshing anthropological methodology studying ancient thought culture reduced ideological perspective designed show
private property state machinery eternal adjuncts human existence
spiritualistic outlook innate man
johannes quack preface book indian atheism marxist analysis writes book based awareness indian struggle socialism today related struggle indian philosophical heritage
chattopadhaya says convinced analysis philosophical materials india will lead rightly followed marxism india
calls book most powerful ideological weapon destroy fiction indian wisdom being essentially god oriented
reviewing same book dale riepe calls most complete study kind special importance lies iconoclasm toppling idols european indian accounts early indian religion philosophy
notes book ends another 140 pages text staggering load argument will make rationalists theists alike somewhat dizzy
noticing chattopadhyaya's book markedly different mainstream scholarship indian philosophy calls work almost unique history indian philosophy
book indian philosophy since independence dale riepe calls debiprasad's lokayata work originality world significance
fully-founded work showing philosophical implications historical considerations
chattopadhyaya proponent historical dialectical materialism writes riepe chattopadhyaya's book according riepe classic
giving overview debiprasad's other books riepe writes these indications herculean efforts debiprasad earnest tokens awareness great work still done indian philosophy
although planted almost alone indian fields others slowly harvesting results home abroad renown exceeding many leading idealists
according chattopadhyaya states riepe buddha looked backwards tribal collectives wanted revive
imaginary substance tribe
according dale riepe chattopadhyaya claims most ancient indian traditional philosophers atheists contrasting approach taken debiprasad approach taken followers modern western idealism like s
dasgupta riepe writes debiprasad's approach here based anthropological archaeological findings sharp contrast mythopoeic constructions revivalists indian philosophers following lead modern western idealism
debiprasad's approach contrast teacher surendranath dasgupta simply ideological conceptual literary fine work dasgupta achieved bound idealistic viewpoint even uses important physical data
debiprasad stresses need establish historical account indian thought basis objective scientific approach
implies use relevant scientific methods scientific knowledge order explain rise indian philosophy interpret significance history india
various publications chattopadhyaya carvaka/lokayata praised pioneering important contributions studies ramakrishna bhattacharya
however bhattacharya also questions chattopadhyaya analysis
example ramkrishna bhattacharya states chattopadhyaya deny ajita kesakambali materialist chose emphasize 'ajita no less philosopher futility moral collapse buddha mahavira purana pakudha [
bhattacharya notes chattopadhyaya brands ajita's teachings philosophy graveyard
chattopadhyaya's rational reconstruction history indian materialism lokayata study ancient indian materialism other texts most significant contributions states rajendra prasad
chattopadhyaya's pursuit notes prasad result much commitment values scholarship communist movement india
efforts explain materialism atheism indian philosophy antiquity against old fashioned conception india land dreamers mystics required tremendous intellectual courage yet chattopadhyaya never flinched face isolation own profession
endorsing book lokayata joseph needham your book will truly treasured place my shelves
truly extraordinary should approached ancient chinese ancient indian civilisations such similar results
chattopadhayay's 1977 book science society ancient india feel you entirely proved your case caraka-samhita susruta-samhita ambiguous character dissected reveals intense struggle theological philosophers hand doctors strove truly scientific view world other
unmistakably chapter 'warfare science religion'
feel your philological philosophical analysis here really splendid contribution
