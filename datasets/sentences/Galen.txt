galen promoted theory typology human temperaments
imbalance each humor corresponded particular human temperament blood—sanguine black bile—melancholic yellow bile—choleric phlegm—phlegmatic
individuals sanguine temperaments extroverted social
choleric people energy passion charisma
melancholics creative kind considerate
phlegmatic temperaments characterized dependability kindness affection
galen’s principal interest human anatomy roman law prohibited dissection human cadavers since 150 bc
because restriction galen performed anatomical dissections living vivisection dead animals mostly focusing pigs primates
work useful because anatomical structures these animals usually closely mirror those humans
galen clarified anatomy trachea first demonstrate larynx generates voice
experiment galen used bellows inflate lungs dead animal
among galen’s major contributions medicine work circulatory system
first recognize there distinct differences venous dark arterial bright blood
although anatomical experiments animal models led complete understanding circulatory system nervous system respiratory system other structures work contained scientific errors
galen believed circulatory system consist two separate one-way systems distribution rather single unified system circulation
believed venous blood generated liver distributed consumed organs body
posited arterial blood originated heart distributed consumed organs body
blood then regenerated either liver heart completing cycle
galen also believed existence group blood vessels called rete mirabile carotid sinus
both these theories circulation blood later shown incorrect ibn al-nafis
work de motu musculorum galen explained difference motor sensory nerves discussed concept muscle tone explained difference agonists antagonists
galen skilled surgeon operating human patients
many procedures techniques used again centuries such procedures performed brains eyes
correct cataracts patients galen performed operation similar modern
using needle-shaped instrument galen attempted remove cataract-affected lens eye
surgical experiments included ligating arteries living animals
first reluctantly then increasing vigour galen promoted hippocratic teaching including venesection bloodletting then unknown rome
sharply criticised erasistrateans predicted dire outcomes believing blood pneuma flowed veins
galen however staunchly defended venesection three books subject demonstrations public disputations
contributions philosophy see also philosophy medicine although main focus work medicine anatomy physiology galen also logic philosophy
writings influenced earlier greek roman thinkers including plato aristotle stoics
galen concerned combine philosophical thought medical practice brief work best physician also philosopher
took aspects each group combined them original thought
regarded medicine interdisciplinary field best practiced utilizing theory observation experimentation conjunction
several schools thought existed within medical field during galen's lifetime main two being empiricists rationalists also called dogmatists philosophers methodists being smaller group
empiricists emphasized importance physical practice experimentation active learning medical discipline
direct opposition empiricists rationalists valued study established teachings order create new theories name medical advancements
methodists formed somewhat middle ground experimental empiricists nor theoretical rationalists
methodists mainly utilized pure observation showing greater interest studying natural course ailments making efforts find remedies
galen's education exposed four major schools thought platonists peripatetics stoics epicureans teachers rationalist sect empiricist sect
galen's opposition stoics galen well known advancements medical field circulatory system also quite involved philosophy
developed own tripartite soul following examples plato scholars reference platonist
galen agreed claim because primarily scientist claims supported scientific evidence plato purely philosopher
also developed own personality theory connected liquids body believed there physiological basis mental disorders
lastly connected many theories pneuma most strongly opposed stoics definition use pneuma
stoics according galen failed give credible answer localization functions psyche mind
through use medicine convinced came up better answer brain
stoics recognized soul having part rational soul claimed found heart
galen following plato's idea came up two parts soul
galen also rejected stoic propositional logic instead embraced hypothetical syllogistic strongly influenced peripatetics based elements aristotelian logic
localization function galen’s major works doctrines hippocrates plato sought demonstrate unity two subjects their views
using their theories combined aristotle's galen developed tripartite soul consisting similar aspects
used same terms plato referring three parts rational spiritual appetitive
each corresponded localized area body
rational soul brain spiritual soul heart appetitive soul liver
galen first scientist philosopher assign specific parts soul locations body because extensive background medicine
idea now referred localization function
galen’s assignments revolutionary time period set precedence future localization theories
galen believed each part tripartite soul controlled specific functions within body soul whole contributed health body strengthening natural functioning capacity organ organs question
rational soul controlled higher level cognitive functioning organism example making choices perceiving world sending those signals brain
also listed “imagination memory recollection knowledge thought consideration voluntary motion sensation being found within rational soul
functions “growing being alive” resided spirited soul
spirited soul also contained our passions such anger
these passions considered even stronger regular emotions consequence dangerous
third part soul appetitive spirit controlled living forces our body most importantly blood
appetitive spirit also regulated pleasures body moved feelings enjoyment
third part soul animalistic natural side soul deals natural urges body survival instincts
galen proposed soul moved too much enjoyment reaches states “incontinence” “licentiousness” inability willfully cease enjoyment negative consequence too much pleasure
order unite theories soul how operated within body adapted theory pneuma used explain how soul operated within assigned organs how those organs turn interacted together
galen then distinguished vital pneuma arterial system psychic pneuma brain nervous system
galen placed vital pneuma heart psychic pneuma within brain
conducted many anatomical studies animals most famously ox study transition vital psychic pneuma
although highly criticized comparing animal anatomy human anatomy galen convinced knowledge abundant enough both anatomies base off other
galen mind–body problem galen believed there no distinction mental physical
controversial argument time-period mind–body problem galen fell greeks believing mind body separate faculties
also believed scientifically proven
opposition stoics became most prevalent
galen proposed organs within body responsible specific functions these functions contributed functioning individual organism whole rather individual parts
according galen stoics' lack scientific justification discredited their claims separateness mind body why spoke strongly against them
galen psychotherapy another galen's major works diagnosis cure soul’s passion contained how approach treat psychological problems
galen’s early attempt psychotherapy
book contained directions how use called talk therapy psychotherapy prompt individual reveal their deepest passions secrets eventually cure them their mental deficiency
leading individual therapist male preferably older wiser age well free control passions
these passions according galen caused psychological problems people experienced

often form restating reinterpreting such magnus nisibis' 4 th-century work urine turn translated arabic
yet full importance contributions appreciated till long after death
galen's rhetoric prolificity powerful convey impression there little left learn
term galenism subsequently taken both positive pejorative meaning transformed medicine late antiquity yet dominated subsequent thinking stifle further progress
after collapse western empire study galen other greek works almost disappeared latin west
contrast predominantly greek-speaking eastern half roman empire byzantium many commentators subsequent centuries such oribasius physician emperor julian compiled synopsis 4 th century preserved disseminated galen's works making galenism accessible
nutton refers these authors medical refrigerators antiquity
late antiquity medical writing veered increasingly direction theoretical expense practical many authors merely debating galenism
magnus nisibis pure theorist john alexandria[disambiguation needed] agnellus ravenna their lectures galen's de sectis

galen's writings shown vesalius describe details present monkeys humans demonstrated galen's limitations through books hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition orthodox pro-galenists such jacobus sylvius
since galen states using observations monkeys human dissection prohibited give account body looks like vesalius portray himself using galen's approach description direct observation create record exact details human body since worked time human dissection allowed
galen argued monkey anatomy close enough humans physicians learn anatomy monkey dissections then make observations similar structures wounds their patients rather trying learn anatomy wounds human patients done students trained empiricist medical sect
