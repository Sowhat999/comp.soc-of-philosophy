until age 15 lived primarily kobe hiroshima received most early education multi-ethnic canadian academy kobe attributes beginnings pluralistic outlook
1940 cobb moved georgia usa finish high school
found himself both bewildered disgusted pervasive racism region particularly demonization japanese
seeing how same events presented such different ways based country living cobb became ever-more counter-cultural critical dominant views churches media universities government
after graduation high school cobb attended emory college oxford georgia before joining u
army 1943
chosen japanese language program filled mainly jewish catholic intellectuals helped make aware narrow parochial nature georgia protestantism
cobb served occupation japan then returned united states left army soon afterward
then entered interdepartmental program university chicago 1947
there set out test faith learning modern world's objections christianity
faith come out intact
determined expose my faith worst world offer
within six months such exposure my faith shattered… god my constant companion lord up point simply evaporated my prayers bounced back ceiling unheard
hoping reconstruct christian faith compatible scientific historical knowledge cobb entered university chicago divinity school
successful restoring personal faith primarily help richard mc keon daniel day williams charles hartshorne

during career cobb also served visiting professor harvard divinity school chicago divinity school vanderbilt divinity school iliff school theology rikkyo university japan university mainz germany
received six honorary doctorates
transdisciplinary work alfred north whitehead cobb's primary intellectual influence
although cobb most often described theologian overarching tendency thought toward integration many different areas knowledge employing alfred north whitehead's transdisciplinary philosophical framework guiding insight
result cobb done work broad range fields
philosophy education cobb consistently opposed splitting education knowledge discrete insulated disciplines departments
believes current university model encourages excessive abstraction because each specialized area study defines own frame reference then tends ignore others discouraging interdisciplinary dialogue inhibiting broad understanding world
combat these problems cobb argues discrete “disciplines” general—and theology particular—need re-emerge their mutual academic isolation
theology should once again tied ethical questions practical everyday concerns well theoretical understanding world
service vision cobb consistently sought integrate knowledge biology physics economics other disciplines theological philosophical work
constructive postmodern philosophy cobb convinced alfred north whitehead right viewing both nature human beings just purposeless machines
rather seeing nature purely mechanical human consciousness strange exception must explained away whiteheadian naturalism went opposite direction arguing subjective experience world should inform view rest nature just mechanical
short nature should seen having subjective purposive aspect deserves attention
speaking need moving beyond classically modern ideas 1960 s cobb first label whiteheadian thought “postmodern
later deconstructionists began describe their thought “postmodern” whiteheadians changed their own label “constructive postmodernism
like deconstructionist counterpart constructive postmodernism arose partly response dissatisfaction cartesian mind-matter dualism viewed matter inert machine human mind wholly different nature
while modern science uncovered voluminous evidence against idea cobb argues dualistic assumptions continue persist whole dualism accepted general culture
day shapes structure university division sciences humanities
most people whether articulate view world given them sight touch material while consider themselves transcend purely material status
while deconstructionists concluded must abandon any further attempts create comprehensive vision world cobb other constructive postmodernists believe metaphysics comprehensive world-models possible still needed
particular argued new whiteheadian metaphysics based events rather substances
formulation incorrect say person thing substance fundamental identity remains constant any changes person thing secondary
instead each moment person's life event seen new actuality thus asserting continual change transformation fundamental while static identities far less important
view easily reconciles itself certain findings modern science such evolution wave-particle duality
environmental ethics ecological themes pervasive cobb's work since 1969 turned attention ecological crisis
became convinced environmental issues constituted humanity's most pressing problem
cobb writes during seventies my sense theological vocation changed
lose interest developing christian tradition render intelligible convincing illuminating changing context
reject compartmentalization my discipline 'constructive theology' especially separation ethics generally isolation other academic disciplines
persuaded no problem critical decent survival humanity threatened destroy itself exhausting polluting natural context
cobb went write first single-author book environmental ethics too late? theology ecology 1971
book argued ecological worldview acknowledges continuity human beings other living things well their mutual dependence
also proposed christianity specifically needed appropriate knowledge biological sciences order undercut anthropocentrism human-centeredness devaluation non-human world
critique growth-oriented economics city hall claremont california
cobb lived worked claremont since 1958
cobb's economic critiques arose natural extension interest ecological issues
recognized write ecological sustainable just society without including discussion economics
part investigation why economic policies frequently worsened ecological situation 1980 s cobb decided re-evaluate gross national product gnp gross domestic product gdp measures economic progress
together son clifford cobb developed alternative model index sustainable economic welfare isew sought consolidate economic environmental social elements common framework show net progress
name metric later change genuine progress indicator gpi
recent 2013 article shown global gpi per capita peaked 1978 meaning social environmental costs economic growth outweighed benefits since time
cobb also co-authored book herman daly 1989 entitled common good redirecting economy toward community environment sustainable future outlined policy changes intended create society based community ecological balance
1992 common good earned cobb daly grawemeyer award ideas improving world order
recent years cobb described current growth-oriented economic systems prime example corruption american culture religion since rise modern economics christians forced give up their criticism greed because economists greed good you really want help people greedy possible
cobb sees such values being direct opposition message jesus many places explicitly criticizes accumulation wealth
because christianity's widespread acceptance such economic values cobb sees christians far less confident proclaiming values jesus
biology religion along whitehead cobb sought reconcile science religion places appear conflict well encourage religion make use scientific insights vice versa
area religion biology co-wrote liberation life cell community australian geneticist charles birch 1981
book critiqued dominant biological model mechanism arguing leads study organisms abstraction their environments
cobb birch argue instead ecological model draws no sharp lines living non-living organism environment
book also argues idea evolution adaptive behavior lead genetic changes
cobb birch stress species co-evolves environment way intelligent purpose plays role evolution evolution process ruthless competition directed goal ever-increasing power complexity
such attitude failing adaptive fact conducive evolutionary success
species co-evolves environment
equally there no stable harmonious nature whose wisdom humanity should simply submit
intelligent purpose plays role adaptive behaviour environments change role increased
liberation life stresses life just human life purposeful aims realization richer experience
cobb birch develop idea trusting life religious impulse rather attempting achieve settled perfected social structure does allow change evolution
religious pluralism interreligious dialogue cobb participated extensive interreligious interfaith dialogue most notably masao abe japanese buddhist kyoto school philosophy
cobb's explicit aim gain ideas insights other religions eye toward augmenting universalizing christianity
cobb writes
mission christianity become universal faith sense taking itself alien truths others realized
no mere matter addition
instead matter creative transformation
untransformed christianity christianity limited own parochial traditions cannot fulfill mission realizing universal meaning jesus christ
short cobb does conceive dialogue useful primarily convert converted rather useful order transform both parties mutually allowing broadening ideas reimagining each faith order might better face challenges modern world
cobb also active formulating own theories religious pluralism partly response another claremont graduate university professor john hick
cobb's pluralism sometimes identified kind deep pluralism alternately complementary pluralism
believes there actually three distinct religious ultimates god 2 creativity/emptiness/nothingness/being-itself 3 cosmos/universe
cobb believes these elements necessary present form every religion different faiths tend stress ultimate over others
viewed way different religions may seen complement each other providing insight different religious ultimates
cobb's pluralism thus avoids criticism conflating religions actually very different instance buddhism christianity while still affirming possible truths both
revitalizing christianity pluralistic world david ray griffin
cobb co-founded center process studies griffin 1973
cobb believed through least nineteenth century first half twentieth century american protestant theology largely derivative european specifically german theology
late 1950 s cobb claremont professor james robinson decided time come end one-sidedness move authentic dialogue american european theologians
establish real mutuality organized series conferences leading theologians germany united states published series volumes called new frontiers theology
after writing several books surveying contemporary forms christian protestantism cobb turned mid-1960 s original work sought bring alfred north whitehead's ideas contemporary american protestant scene
cobb aimed reconstruct christian vision compatible modern knowledge ready engage today’s pluralistic world
number ways
cobb stressed problems inherent calls “substantialist” worldview—ultimately derived classical greek philosophy—that still dominates christian theology well most western thought
substantialist way thinking necessitates mind-matter dualism matter mind two fundamentally different kinds entities
also encourages seeing relations entities being unimportant entity itself
contrast view cobb follows whitehead attributing primacy events processes rather substances
whiteheadian view nothing contained within own sharp boundaries
fact way thing relates other things makes
cobb writes “if substantialist view abandoned quite different picture emerges
each occasion human experience constituted incorporation cellular occasions body also incorporation aspects other people
people internally relate another
hence character one's being moment moment affected health happiness one's neighbors
cobb metaphysics process better-aligned bible stresses history community importance one’s neighbors
claremont school theology 2013 also instead turning further inward preserve cohesive christian community cobb turned outward order discover truths christianity may yet possess
direct opposition those feel christianity religious system absolutely final complete free error
cobb turned other religions most notably buddhism order supplement christian ideas systems also other disciplines including biology physics economics
fact cobb shied away even re-imaging now regarded “traditional” christian notion god
does believe god omnipotent sense having unilateral control over events since cobb sees reconciling total coercive power love goodness impossible task
instead creatures viewed having degree freedom god cannot override
cobb solves problem evil denying god’s omnipotence stressing instead god’s power persuasive rather coercive god influence creatures determine become
cobb god’s role liberate empower
against traditional theism cobb also denied idea god immutable unchanging impassible unfeeling
instead stresses god affected changed actions creatures both human otherwise
cobb idea god experiences changes does mean god imperfect—quite contrary
instead god seen experiencing beings hence understanding empathizing beings becoming fellow sufferer understands
cobb argues idea god compatible bible jesus suffers dies
additionally cobb's theology argued against idea salvation singular binary event either saved saved time
rather seeing one's time world test one's morality order enter heavenly realm cobb sees salvation continual striving transform perfect our experience world
cobb's idea salvation focuses less moral categories aesthetic categories—such preference intense experience over dull experience beauty rather ugliness
cobb writes morality bound up contributing others crucial question contributed? contribution might making them moral fine
finally true morality cannot aim simply spread morality
must aim wellbeing those tries help broader sense
process thought must perfection their experience inclusively
cobb admits idea morality being subservient aesthetics shocking many christians yet argues there must life simply being morally good morally bad aesthetic categories fulfill function specifically because defined goods themselves
within last twenty years cobb become increasingly distressed popular identification christianity religious right weak response mainstream protestants
encourage stronger response organized progressive christians uniting noted episcopal priest george regas 1996 chaired reflection committee edited number books
perceived gap policies american government christian teaching grew wider these books moved beyond simply reformist proposals
last these entitled resistance new role progressive christians
cobb's most recent book entitled spiritual bankruptcy prophetic call action
argues against both religiousness secularism claiming needed secularization wisdom traditions
influence cobb's thought china process philosophy tradition alfred north whitehead often considered primarily american philosophical movement spread globally particular interest chinese thinkers
process philosophy's leading figures cobb taken leadership role bringing process thought east most specifically help china develop ecological civilization—a goal current chinese government written constitution
