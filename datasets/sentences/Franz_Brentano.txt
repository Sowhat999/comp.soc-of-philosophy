april 2007 intentionality main article intentionality brentano best known reintroduction concept intentionality — concept derived scholastic philosophy — contemporary philosophy lectures work psychologie vom empirischen standpunkt psychology empirical standpoint
while often simplistically summarised aboutness relationship mental acts external world brentano defined main characteristic mental phenomena distinguished physical phenomena
every mental phenomenon every psychological act content directed object intentional object
every belief desire etc
object believed desired
brentano used expression intentional inexistence indicate status objects thought mind
property being intentional having intentional object key feature distinguish psychological phenomena physical phenomena because brentano defined physical phenomena lacked ability generate original intentionality facilitate intentional relationship second-hand manner labeled derived intentionality
“ every mental phenomenon characterized scholastics middle ages called intentional mental inexistence object might call though wholly unambiguously reference content direction towards object understood here meaning thing immanent objectivity
every mental phenomenon includes something object within itself although same way
presentation something presented judgement something affirmed denied love loved hate hated desire desired
intentional in-existence characteristic exclusively mental phenomena
no physical phenomenon exhibits anything like
therefore define mental phenomena saying those phenomena contain object intentionally within themselves

theory perception also well known claiming wahrnehmung ist falschnehmung 'perception misception' say perception erroneous
fact maintained external sensory perception tell us anything de facto existence perceived world simply illusion
however absolutely sure our internal perception
hear tone cannot completely sure there tone real world am absolutely certain hear
awareness fact hear called internal perception
external perception sensory perception yield hypotheses perceived world truth
hence many pupils particular carl stumpf edmund husserl thought natural sciences yield hypotheses never universal absolute truths pure logic mathematics
however reprinting psychologie vom empirischen standpunkte [psychology empirical standpoint] recanted previous view
attempted without reworking previous arguments within work wholly unsuccessful
new view states hear sound hear something external world there no physical phenomena internal perception
theory judgment brentano theory judgment different currently predominant fregean view
centre brentano’s theory judgment lies idea judgment depends having presentation presentation does predicated
even stronger brentano thought predication even necessary judgment because there judgments without predicational content
another fundamental aspect theory judgments existential
so-called existential claim implies someone judging s p he/she judging s p exists
note brentano denied idea judgments form s p [and other kinds judgment combine presentations]
brentano argued there also judgments arising single presentation e
“the planet mars exists” presentation
brentano’s own symbols judgment form ‘+a’ exists ‘–a’ does exist
combined third fundamental claim brentano idea judgments either positive judging exists negative judging does exist complete picture brentano’s theory judgment
imagine you doubt whether midgets exist
point you presentation midgets your mind
you judge midgets exist then you judging presentation you does present something exists
you utter words otherwise predicate judgment
whole judgment takes place denial approval existence presentation you
problem brentano’s theory judgment idea judgments existential judgments though sometimes very complex enterprise transform ordinary judgment existential real problem brentano made no distinction object presentation
presentation exists object your mind
you cannot really judge does exist because you you also judge presentation there impossible according brentano’s idea judgments object judged presentation
twardowski acknowledged problem solved denying object equal presentation
actually change within brentano’s theory perception welcome consequence theory judgment viz
you presentation exists same time judge object does exist
