critical realism bhaskar's consideration philosophies science social science resulted development critical realism philosophical approach defends critical emancipatory potential rational scientific philosophical enquiry against both positivist broadly defined 'postmodern' challenges
approach emphasises importance distinguishing epistemological ontological questions significance objectivity properly understood critical project
conception philosophy social science socially situated socially determined maintains possibility objective critique motivate social change ultimate end being promotion human freedom
term critical realism initially used bhaskar
philosophy began life bhaskar called 'transcendental realism' realist theory science 1975 extended social sciences 'critical naturalism' possibility naturalism 1978
term 'critical realism' elision transcendental realism critical naturalism subsequently accepted bhaskar after being proposed others partly because appropriate connotations critical realism shares certain dimensions german critical theory see frankfurt school
critical realism should confused various other 'critical realism's including georg lukács' aesthetic theory alister mc grath's scientific theology theological critical realism although share common goals
contemporary critical realist texts 'critical realism' often abbreviated 'cr'
later dialectical development critical realism bhaskar's work dialectic pulse freedom 1993 plato etc 1994 led separate branch second phase cr known 'dialectical critical realism' dcrbenton
first 'phase' critical realism accrued large number adherents proponents britain many whom involved radical philosophy group related movements radical philosophy journal much early cr scholarship first appeared
argued objectivist realist approach science based kant-style transcendental analysis scientific experimental activity
stressing need retain both subjective epistemological 'transitive' side knowledge objective ontological 'intransitive' side bhaskar developed theory science social science thought sustain reality objects science their knowability also incorporate insights 'sociology knowledge' movement emphasised theory-laden historically contingent socially situated nature knowledge
emerged marriage ontological realism epistemological relativism forming objectivist yet fallibilist theory knowledge
bhaskar's main strategy argue reality depth knowledge penetrate less deeply reality without ever reaching 'bottom'
bhaskar reintroduced 'ontology' philosophy science time almost heresy arguing ontology stratified emergence differentiated structure supported ontological reality causal powers independent their empirical effects such move opened up possibility non-reductivist non-positivistic account causal explanation human social domain
explanatory project linked critical project main idea doctrine 'explanatory critique' bhaskar developed fully scientific realism human emancipation 1987
developed critical tradition 'ideology critique' within cr framework arguing certain kinds explanatory accounts lead directly evaluations thus science function normatively just descriptively positivism since hume's law assumed
such move hoped provide holy grail critical theory objective normative foundation
'second phase' critical realism dialectic turn initiated dialectic pulse freedom 1993 won new adherents drew criticism critical realists
argued 'dialecticising' cr through elaborate reading hegel marx
arguing against hegel marx dialectical connections relations contradictions themselves ontological objectively real bhaskar developed concept real absence claimed provide robust foundation reality objectivity values criticism
attempted incorporate critical rational human agency dialectic figure 'fourth dimension' dialectic thereby grounding systematic model rational emancipatory transformative practice
2000 bhaskar published east west odyssey soul first expressed ideas related spiritual values came seen beginning so-called 'spiritual' turn led final phase cr dubbed 'transcendental dialectical critical realism'
publication ones followed highly controversial led something split among bhaskar's proponents
whilst respected critical realists cautiously supported bhaskar's 'spiritual turn' others took view development compromised status cr serious philosophical movement
reflections meta-reality states book articulates difference critical realism development new philosophical standpoint am process developing called philosophy meta-reality
main departure seems emphasis shift away western dualism non-dual model emancipation entails breakdown overcoming duality separateness things
however move seen undermine early critical realisms strongest aspects
criticism whilst early books considered models clarity rigour bhaskar criticised truly appalling style alex callinicos 1994 dialectical works written
won bad writing contest 1996 passage taken plato etc
style may result fast writing initially using voice recorder
other criticisms levelled substance bhaskar's arguments various points
objection bhaskar's early critical realism begs question assuming rather proving existence intransitive domain
another objection raised callinicos others bhaskar's so-called transcendental arguments really
certainly typical transcendental arguments philosophers such charles taylor defined them distinguishing feature identification putative condition possibility experience
however arguments function analogous way since try argue scientific practice unintelligible and/or inexplicable absence ontological features identifies
alleged dialectical phase philosophy proves too much since critical realism already dialectical
bhaskar's concept real absence questioned among others andrew collier points out fact fails distinguish properly real nominal absences real nominal absences after postmodernism 2001
bhaskar's most recent 'spiritual' phase criticised many adherents early critical realism departing fundamental positions made important interesting without providing philosophical support new ideas
