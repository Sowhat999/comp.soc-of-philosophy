vaz conceived language itself system classification speak something merely establish place simplified scheme therefore detach complexity reality

whereas bad skepticism presumes impossibility understanding good skepticism encourages healthy distrust language systematization
while bad pragmatism subjugates belief entirely one's own will good pragmatism regulates belief acknowledging one's ignorance
