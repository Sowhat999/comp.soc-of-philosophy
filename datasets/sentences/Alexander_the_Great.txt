there two different versions alexander's death details death differ slightly each
plutarch's account roughly 14 days before death alexander entertained admiral nearchus spent night next day drinking medius larissa
developed fever worsened until unable speak
common soldiers anxious health granted right file past silently waved them
second account diodorus recounts alexander struck pain after downing large bowl unmixed wine honour heracles followed days weakness develop fever died after agony
arrian also mentioned alternative plutarch specifically denied claim
given propensity macedonian aristocracy assassination foul play featured multiple accounts death
diodorus plutarch arrian justin mentioned theory alexander poisoned
justin stated alexander victim poisoning conspiracy plutarch dismissed fabrication while both diodorus arrian noted mentioned sake completeness
accounts nevertheless fairly consistent designating antipater recently removed macedonian viceroy odds olympias head alleged plot
perhaps taking summons babylon death sentence having seen fate parmenion philotas antipater purportedly arranged alexander poisoned son iollas alexander's wine-pourer
there even suggestion aristotle may participated
strongest argument against poison theory fact twelve days passed start illness death such long-acting poisons probably available
however 2003 bbc documentary investigating death alexander leo schep new zealand national poisons center proposed plant white hellebore veratrum album known antiquity may used poison alexander
2014 manuscript journal clinical toxicology schep suggested alexander's wine spiked veratrum album produce poisoning symptoms match course events described alexander romance
veratrum album poisoning prolonged course suggested alexander poisoned veratrum album offers most plausible cause
another poisoning explanation put forward 2010 proposed circumstances death compatible poisoning water river styx modern-day mavroneri arcadia greece contained calicheamicin dangerous compound produced bacteria
several natural causes diseases suggested including malaria typhoid fever
1998 article new england journal medicine attributed death typhoid fever complicated bowel perforation ascending paralysis
another recent analysis suggested pyogenic infectious spondylitis meningitis
other illnesses fit symptoms including acute pancreatitis west nile virus
natural-cause theories also tend emphasise alexander's health may general decline after years heavy drinking severe wounds
anguish alexander felt after hephaestion's death may also contributed declining health

arrian plutarch claimed alexander speechless point implying apocryphal story
diodorus curtius justin offered plausible story alexander passed signet ring perdiccas bodyguard leader companion cavalry front witnesses thereby nominating
perdiccas initially claim power instead suggesting roxane's baby king male himself craterus leonnatus antipater guardians
however infantry under command meleager rejected arrangement since excluded discussion
instead supported alexander's half-brother philip arrhidaeus

character generalship battle granicus 334 bc battle issus 333 bc alexander earned epithet great due unparalleled success military commander
never lost battle despite typically being outnumbered
due use terrain phalanx cavalry tactics bold strategy fierce loyalty troops

alexander also recognized potential disunity among diverse army employed various languages weapons
overcame being personally involved battle manner macedonian king
first battle asia granicus alexander used small part forces[citation needed] perhaps 13000 infantry 5000 cavalry against much larger persian force 40000
alexander placed phalanx center cavalry archers wings line matched length persian cavalry line 3 km
86 mi
contrast persian infantry stationed behind cavalry
ensured alexander outflanked while phalanx armed long pikes considerable advantage over persian's scimitars javelins
macedonian losses negligible compared those persians
issus 333 bc first confrontation darius used same deployment again central phalanx pushed through
alexander personally led charge center routing opposing army
decisive encounter darius gaugamela darius equipped chariots scythes wheels break up phalanx equipped cavalry pikes
alexander arranged double phalanx center advancing angle parting chariots bore down then reforming
advance successful broke darius' center causing latter flee once again
faced opponents used unfamiliar fighting techniques such central asia india alexander adapted forces opponents' style
thus bactria sogdiana alexander successfully used javelin throwers archers prevent outflanking movements while massing cavalry center
india confronted porus' elephant corps macedonians opened their ranks envelop elephants used their sarissas strike upwards dislodge elephants' handlers
