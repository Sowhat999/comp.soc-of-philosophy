aristotle's writings science largely qualitative opposed quantitative
beginning 16 th century scientists began applying mathematics physical sciences aristotle's work area deemed hopelessly inadequate
failings largely due absence concepts like mass velocity force temperature
conception speed temperature no quantitative understanding them partly due absence basic experimental devices like clocks thermometers
writings provide account many scientific observations mixture precocious accuracy curious errors
example history animals claimed human males teeth females
similar vein john philoponus later galileo showed simple experiments aristotle's theory heavier object falls faster lighter object incorrect
other hand aristotle refuted democritus's claim milky way made up those stars shaded earth sun's rays pointing out correctly even such reasoning bound dismissed long time given current astronomical demonstrations size sun greater earth distance stars earth many times greater sun then
sun shines stars earth screens none them
places aristotle goes too far deriving 'laws universe' simple observation over-stretched reason
today's scientific method assumes such thinking without sufficient facts ineffective discerning validity one's hypothesis requires far rigorous experimentation aristotle used support laws
aristotle also scientific blind spots
posited geocentric cosmology may discern selections metaphysics widely accepted up until 16 th century
3 rd century 16 th century dominant view held earth rotational center universe
because perhaps philosopher most respected european thinkers during after renaissance these thinkers often took aristotle's erroneous positions given held back science epoch
however aristotle's scientific shortcomings should mislead forgetting great advances many scientific fields
instance founded logic formal science created foundations biology superseded two millennia
moreover introduced fundamental notion nature composed things change studying such changes provide useful knowledge underlying constants
geology quoted charles lyell's principles geology [aristotle] refers many examples changes now constantly going insists emphatically great results must produce lapse ages

says [12 th chapter meteorics] 'the distribution land sea particular regions does endure throughout time becomes sea those parts land again becomes land sea there reason thinking these changes take place according certain system within certain period
concluding observation follows 'as time never fails universe eternal neither tanais nor nile flowed ever
places rise once dry there limit their operations there none time
also other rivers spring up perish sea also continually deserts lands invades others same tracts therefore earth sea others continents every thing changes course time
physics main article aristotelian physics five elements main article classical element aristotle proposed fifth element aether addition four proposed earlier empedocles
earth cold dry corresponds modern idea solid
water cold wet corresponds modern idea liquid
air hot wet corresponds modern idea gas
fire hot dry corresponds modern ideas plasma heat
aether divine substance makes up heavenly spheres heavenly bodies stars planets
each four earthly elements natural place
earthly tends toward center universe
center earth
water tends toward sphere surrounding center
air tends toward sphere surrounding water sphere
fire tends toward lunar sphere moon orbits
elements moved out their natural place naturally move back towards
natural motion—motion requiring no extrinsic cause
example water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up air rain falls flame rises
outside other spheres heavenly fifth element manifested stars planets moves perfection circles
motion main article potentiality actuality aristotle defined motion actuality potentiality such
aquinas suggested passage understood literally motion indeed understood active fulfillment potential transition toward potentially possible state
because actuality potentiality normally opposites aristotle other commentators either suggest wording come down us erroneous addition such definition critical understanding
causality four causes main article four causes aristotle suggested reason anything coming attributed four different types simultaneously active causal factors material cause describes material out something composed
thus material cause table wood material cause car rubber steel
does mean domino knocks over another domino
formal cause form
arrangement matter
tells us thing any thing determined definition form pattern essence whole synthesis archetype
embraces account causes terms fundamental principles general laws whole
macrostructure cause parts relationship known whole-part causation
plainly put formal cause idea existing first place exemplar mind sculptor second place intrinsic determining cause embodied matter
formal cause refer essential quality causation
simple example formal cause mental image idea allows artist architect engineer create drawings
efficient cause primary source change under consideration proceeds
identifies 'what makes made causes change changed' suggests sorts agents nonliving living acting sources change movement rest
representing current understanding causality relation cause effect covers modern definitions cause either agent agency particular events states affairs
take two dominoes time equal weighting first knocked over causing second also fall over
final cause purpose sake thing exists done including both purposeful instrumental actions activities
final cause teleos purpose function something supposed serve
covers modern ideas motivating causes such volition need desire ethics spiritual beliefs
additionally things causes another causing each other reciprocally hard work causes fitness vice versa although same way function beginning change other goal
thus aristotle first suggested reciprocal circular causality relation mutual dependence influence cause upon effect
moreover aristotle indicated same thing cause contrary effects presence absence may result different outcomes
simply goal purpose brings event
our two dominoes require someone something intentionally knock over first domino because cannot fall own accord
aristotle marked two modes causation proper prior causation accidental chance causation
causes proper incidental spoken potential actual particular generic
same language refers effects causes generic effects assigned generic causes particular effects particular causes operating causes actual effects
essentially causality does suggest temporal relation cause effect
optics aristotle held accurate theories optical concepts other philosophers day
second oldest written evidence camera obscura after mozi c
400 bc found aristotle's documentation such device 350 bc problemata
aristotle's apparatus contained dark chamber single small hole aperture allow sunlight enter
aristotle used device make observations sun noted no matter shape hole sun still correctly displayed round object
modern cameras analogous diaphragm
aristotle also made observation distance aperture surface image increased image magnified
chance spontaneity according aristotle spontaneity chance causes things distinguishable other types cause
chance incidental cause lies realm accidental things
spontaneous note spontaneous does come chance
better understanding aristotle's conception chance might better think coincidence something takes place chance person sets out intent having thing take place result another thing intended taking place
example person seeks donations
person may find another person willing donate substantial sum
however person seeking donations met person donating purpose collecting donations other purpose aristotle call collecting donation particular donator result chance
must unusual something happens chance
other words something happens most time cannot say chance
there also specific kind chance aristotle names luck apply human beings because sphere moral actions
according aristotle luck must involve choice thus deliberation humans capable deliberation choice
capable action cannot anything chance
metaphysics main article metaphysics aristotle aristotle defines metaphysics knowledge immaterial being being highest degree abstraction
refers metaphysics first philosophy well theologic science
substance potentiality actuality see also potentiality actuality aristotle aristotle examines concepts substance essence ousia metaphysics book vii concludes particular substance combination both matter form
book viii distinguishes matter substance substratum stuff composed
example matter house bricks stones timbers etc
whatever constitutes potential house while form substance actual house namely 'covering bodies chattels' any other differentia see also predicables let us define something house
formula gives components account matter formula gives differentia account form
regard change kinesis causes now defines physics generation corruption 319 b–320 distinguishes coming growth diminution change quantity locomotion change space alteration change quality
coming change nothing persists resultant property
particular change introduces concept potentiality dynamis actuality entelecheia association matter form
referring potentiality thing capable doing being acted upon conditions right prevented something else
example seed plant soil potentially dynamei plant prevented something will become plant
potentially beings either 'act' poiein 'be acted upon' paschein either innate learned
example eyes possess potentiality sight innate being acted upon while capability playing flute possessed learning exercise acting
actuality fulfillment end potentiality
because end telos principle every change sake end exists potentiality therefore actuality end

sake thing principle becoming sake end actuality end sake potentiality acquired
animals see order may sight sight may see
summary matter used make house potentiality house both activity building form final house actualities also final cause end
then aristotle proceeds concludes actuality prior potentiality formula time substantiality
definition particular substance
matter form aristotle tries solve problem unity beings example makes man one? since according plato there two ideas animal biped how then man unity? however according aristotle potential being matter actual form same thing
universals particulars main article aristotle's theory universals aristotle's predecessor plato argued things universal form either property relation other things
look apple example see apple also analyze form apple
distinction there particular apple universal form apple
moreover place apple next book speak both book apple being next each other
plato argued there universal forms part particular things
example possible there no particular good existence good still proper universal form
bertrand russell 20 th-century philosopher agreed plato existence uninstantiated universals
aristotle disagreed plato point arguing universals instantiated
aristotle argued there no universals unattached existing things
according aristotle universal exists either particular relation then there must must currently must future something universal predicated
consequently according aristotle case universal predicated object exists period time then does exist
addition aristotle disagreed plato location universals
plato spoke world forms location universal forms subsist aristotle maintained universals exist within each thing each universal predicated
according aristotle form apple exists within each apple rather world forms

classification living things aristotle distinguished 500 species birds mammals fishes
classification living things contains elements still existed 19 th century
modern zoologist call vertebrates invertebrates aristotle called 'animals blood' 'animals without blood' know complex invertebrates make use hemoglobin different kind vertebrates
animals blood divided live-bearing mammals egg-bearing birds fish
invertebrates 'animals without blood' insects crustacea divided non-shelled cephalopods shelled testacea molluscs

charles singer nothing remarkable [aristotle's] efforts [exhibit] relationships living things scala naturae aristotle's history animals classified organisms relation hierarchical ladder life scala naturae great chain being placing them according complexity structure function higher organisms showed greater vitality ability move
aristotle believed intellectual purposes
final causes guided natural processes
such teleological view gave aristotle cause justify observed data expression formal design
noting no animal same time both tusks horns single-hooved animal two horns never seen aristotle suggested nature giving no animal both horns tusks staving off vanity giving creatures faculties such degree necessary
noting ruminants multiple stomachs weak teeth supposed first compensate latter nature trying preserve type balance
similar fashion aristotle believed creatures arranged graded scale perfection rising plants up man scala naturae
system eleven grades arranged according degree infected potentiality expressed their form birth
highest animals laid warm wet creatures alive lowest bore theirs cold dry thick eggs
aristotle also held level creature's perfection reflected form preordained form
ideas like ideas souls regarded science modern times
placed emphasis types soul organism possessed asserting plants possess vegetative soul responsible reproduction growth animals vegetative sensitive soul responsible mobility sensation humans vegetative sensitive rational soul capable thought reflection
aristotle contrast earlier philosophers accordance egyptians placed rational soul heart rather brain

theophrastus also recognized role sex reproduction higher plants though last discovery lost later ages
influence hellenistic medicine details topic see medicine ancient greece
after theophrastus lyceum failed produce any original work
though interest aristotle's ideas survived generally taken unquestioningly
until age alexandria under ptolemies advances biology again found
first medical teacher alexandria herophilus chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence brain connected nervous system motion sensation

psychology aristotle's psychology given treatise soul peri psyche often known latin title de anima posits three kinds soul psyches vegetative soul sensitive soul rational soul
humans rational soul
kind soul capable same powers other kinds like vegetative soul grow nourish itself like sensitive soul experience sensations move locally
unique part human rational soul ability receive forms other things compare them
aristotle soul psyche simpler concept us today
soul simply meant form living being
because beings composites form matter form living beings endows them specific living beings e
ability initiate movement case plants growth chemical transformations aristotle considers types movement
memory according aristotle memory ability hold perceived experience your mind ability distinguish internal appearance occurrence past
other words memory mental picture phantasm aristotle defines de anima appearance imprinted part body forms memory
aristotle believed imprint becomes impressed semi-fluid bodily organ undergoes several changes order make memory
memory occurs stimuli too complex nervous system semi-fluid bodily organ cannot receive impressions once
these changes same those involved operations sensation common sense thinking
mental picture imprinted bodily organ final product entire process sense perception
does matter experience seen heard every experience ends up mental image memory aristotle uses word memory two basic abilities
first actual retaining experience mnemonic imprint develop sensation
second intellectual anxiety comes imprint due being impressed particular time processing specific contents
these abilities explained memory neither sensation nor thinking because arises after lapse time
therefore memory past prediction future sensation present
retrieval our imprints cannot performed suddenly
transitional channel needed located our past experiences both our previous experience present experience
aristotle proposed slow-witted people good memory because fluids their brain wash away their memory organ used imprint experiences imprint easily continue
however cannot too slow hardened surface organ will receive new imprints
believed young old properly develop imprint
young people undergo rapid changes develop while elderly's organs beginning decay thus stunting new imprints
likewise people too quick-witted similar young image cannot fixed because rapid changes their organ
because intellectual functions involved memory memories belong animals too those perception time
recollection because aristotle believes people receive kinds sense perceptions people perceive them images imprints people continually weaving together new imprints things experience
order search these imprints people search memory itself
within memory experience offered instead specific memory person will reject experience until find looking
recollection occurs experience naturally follows another
chain images needed memory will stimulate other
chain images needed expected then will stimulate other memory most instances
people recall experiences stimulate certain previous experiences until stimulated needed
recollection self-directed activity retrieving information stored memory imprint after time passed
retrieval stored information dependent scope mnemonic capabilities being human animal abilities human animal possesses
humans will remember imprints intellectual activity such numbers words
animals perception time will able retrieve memories their past observations
remembering involves perception things remembered time passed
recollection imprint present experiences person remembers similar elements corresponding character arrangement past sensory experiences
imprint recalled may bring forth large group related imprints
aristotle believed chain thought ends recollection certain imprints connected systematically three sorts relationships similarity contrast contiguity
these three laws make up laws association
aristotle believed past experiences hidden within our mind
force operates awaken hidden material bring up actual experience
according aristotle association power innate mental state operates upon unexpressed remains former experiences allowing them rise recalled
dreams sleep before understanding aristotle's take dreams first idea sleep must examined
aristotle gives account explanation sleep sleep wakefulness
sleep takes place result overuse senses digestion vital body including senses revitalized
while person asleep critical activities include thinking sensing recalling remembering function during wakefulness
since person cannot sense during sleep also desire result sensation
however senses able work during sleep albeit differently person awake because during sleep person still sensory experiences
also senses inactive during sleep ones weary
theory dreams dreams involve actually sensing stimulus because discussed senses work normally during sleep
dreams sensation still involved altered manner awake
aristotle explains phenomenon occurs person stares moving stimulus such waves body water
look away stimulus next thing look appears moving wave like motion
person perceives stimulus stimulus no longer focus their attention leaves impression
body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli sense impressions left previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant
however during sleep impressions stimuli made throughout day become noticed because there new sensory experiences distract these impressions made
dreams result these lasting impressions
since impressions left exact stimuli dreams will resemble actual experience occurred awake
during sleep person altered state mind
aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus
example person strong infatuation someone may begin think see person everywhere because overtaken their feelings
person asleep their senses acting awake results them thinking like person influenced strong feelings
since person sleeping suggestible state become easily deceived appears their dreams
asleep person unable make judgments awake due senses functioning normally during sleep unable help person judge happening their dream
turn leads person believe dream real
dreams may absurd nature senses able discern whether real
dreamer left accept dream because lack choice judge
component aristotle's theory dreams introduces ideas contradictory previously held beliefs
claimed dreams foretelling sent divine being
aristotle reasoned instances dreams resemble future events happenstances divinations
these ideas contradictory believed dreams time introduced these ideas thinkers beginning give naturalistic opposed supernatural explanations phenomena
aristotle also includes theory dreams constitutes dream does
claimed dream first established fact person asleep experience
person image appear moment after waking up see something dark considered dream because awake occurred
secondly any sensory experience actually occurs while person asleep perceived person while asleep does qualify part dream
example while person sleeping door shuts their dream hear door shut aristotle argues sensory experience part dream
actual sensory experience perceived senses fact occurred while person asleep does make part dream
lastly images dreams must result lasting impressions sensory experiences awake
practical philosophy ethics main article aristotelian ethics aristotle considered ethics practical rather theoretical study
aimed becoming good doing good rather knowing own sake
several treatises ethics including most notably nicomachean ethics
aristotle taught virtue proper function ergon thing
eye good eye much see because proper function eye sight
aristotle reasoned humans must function specific humans function must activity psuchē normally translated soul accordance reason logos
aristotle identified such optimum activity soul aim human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated happiness sometimes well being
potential ever being happy way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated moral ethical virtue excellence
aristotle taught achieve virtuous potentially happy character requires first stage having fortune habituated deliberately teachers experience leading later stage consciously chooses best things
best people come live life way their practical wisdom phronesis their intellect nous develop each other towards highest possible human virtue wisdom accomplished theoretical speculative thinker other words philosopher
politics main article politics aristotle aristotle's classification constitutions addition works ethics address individual aristotle addressed city work titled politics
aristotle considered city natural community
moreover considered city prior importance family turn prior individual whole must necessity prior part
also famously stated man nature political animal also arguing humanity's defining factor among others animal kingdom rationality
aristotle conceived politics being like organism rather like machine collection parts none exist without others
aristotle's conception city organic considered first conceive city manner
common modern understanding political community modern state quite different aristotle's understanding
although aware existence potential larger empires natural community according aristotle city polis functions political community partnership koinōnia
aim city just avoid injustice economic stability rather allow least citizens possibility live good life perform beautiful acts political partnership must regarded therefore being sake noble actions sake living together
distinguished modern approaches beginning social contract theory according individuals leave state nature because fear violent death inconveniences

rhetoric poetics main articles rhetoric aristotle poetics aristotle aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry music imitative each varying imitation medium object manner
example music imitates media rhythm harmony whereas dance imitates rhythm alone poetry language
forms also differ their object imitation
comedy instance dramatic imitation men worse average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better average
lastly forms differ their manner imitation through narrative character through change no change through drama no drama
aristotle believed imitation natural mankind constitutes mankind's advantages over animals
while believed aristotle's poetics comprised two books comedy tragedy portion focuses tragedy survived
aristotle taught tragedy composed six elements plot-structure character style thought spectacle lyric poetry
characters tragedy merely means driving story plot characters chief focus tragedy
tragedy imitation action arousing pity fear meant effect catharsis those same emotions
aristotle concludes poetics discussion either superior epic tragic mimesis
suggests because tragedy possesses attributes epic possibly possesses additional attributes such spectacle music unified achieves aim mimesis shorter scope considered superior epic

loss preservation works see also corpus aristotelicum recovery aristotle first page 1566 edition nicomachean ethics greek latin modern scholarship reveals aristotle's lost works stray considerably characterization surviving aristotelian corpus
whereas lost works appear originally written intent subsequent publication surviving works appear
rather surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended publication
authenticity portion surviving works originally aristotelian also today held suspect books duplicating summarizing each other authorship book questioned another book considered unlikely aristotle's
individual works within corpus including constitution athens regarded most scholars products aristotle's school perhaps compiled under direction supervision
others such colors may produced aristotle's successors lyceum e
theophrastus straton
still others acquired aristotle's name through similarities doctrine content such de plantis possibly nicolaus damascus
other works corpus include medieval palmistries astrological magical texts whose connections aristotle purely fanciful self-promotional
according distinction originates aristotle himself writings divisible two groups exoteric esoteric
most scholars understood distinction works aristotle intended public exoteric technical works intended use within lyceum course / school esoteric
modern scholars commonly assume these latter aristotle's own unpolished lecture notes cases possible notes students
however classic scholar offers alternative interpretation
5 th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes aristotle's writing style deliberately obscurantist good people may reason stretch their mind even whereas empty minds lost through carelessness will put flight obscurity encounter sentences like these
another common assumption none exoteric works extant aristotle's extant writings esoteric kind
current knowledge exactly exoteric writings like scant dubious though many them may dialogue form
fragments aristotle's dialogues survived
perhaps these cicero refers characterized aristotle's writing style river gold hard many modern readers accept seriously admire style those works currently available us
however modern scholars warned cannot know certain cicero's praise reserved specifically exoteric works few modern scholars actually admired concise writing style found aristotle's extant works
major question history aristotle's works then how exoteric writings lost how ones now possess come us
story original manuscripts esoteric treatises described strabo geography plutarch parallel lives
manuscripts left aristotle successor theophrastus turn willed them neleus scepsis
neleus supposedly took writings athens scepsis heirs let them languish cellar until st century bc apellicon teos discovered purchased manuscripts bringing them back athens
according story apellicon tried repair damage done during manuscripts' stay basement introducing number errors text
lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens 86 bc carried off library apellicon rome first published 60 bc grammarian tyrannion amisus then philosopher andronicus rhodes
carnes lord attributes popular belief story fact provides most plausible explanation rapid eclipse peripatetic school after middle third century absence widespread knowledge specialized treatises aristotle throughout hellenistic period well sudden reappearance flourishing aristotelianism during first century
