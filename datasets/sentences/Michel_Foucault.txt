[citation needed] foucault atheist
thought foucault's colleague pierre bourdieu summarised philosopher's thought long exploration transgression going beyond social limits inseparably linked knowledge power
“ theme underlies foucault's work relationship power knowledge how former used control define latter
authorities claim 'scientific knowledge' really just means social control
foucault shows how instance eighteenth century 'madness' used categorise stigmatise just mentally ill poor sick homeless indeed anyone whose expressions individuality unwelcome
— philip stokes philosophy 100 essential thinkers 2004 philosopher philip stokes university reading noted overall foucault's work dark pessimistic leave room optimism illustrates how discipline philosophy used highlight areas domination
doing stokes claimed able understand how being dominated strive build social structures minimise risk domination
development there close attention detail detail eventually individualises people
later life foucault explained work less analysing power phenomenon trying characterise different ways contemporary society expressed use power objectivise subjects
these taken three broad forms involving scientific authority classify 'order' knowledge human populations
second related form categorise 'normalise' human subjects identifying madness illness physical features
third relates manner impulse fashion sexual identities train one's own body engage routines practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within given society

since no human relation devoid power freedom becomes elusive - even ideal
stance critiques normativity socially constructed contingent relies implicit norm order mount critique led philosopher jürgen habermas describe foucault's thinking crypto-normativist covertly reliant very enlightenment principles attempts argue against
similar critique advanced diana taylor nancy fraser argues foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems denies himself recourse concepts such freedom justice therefore lacks ability generate positive alternatives
genealogy historical method philosopher richard rorty argued foucault's 'archaeology knowledge' fundamentally negative thus fails adequately establish any 'new' theory knowledge per se
rather foucault simply provides few valuable maxims regarding reading history
says rorty “ far see offer brilliant redescriptions past supplemented helpful hints how avoid being trapped old historiographical assumptions
these hints consist largely saying look progress meaning history see history given activity any segment culture development rationality freedom use any philosophical vocabulary characterize essence such activity goal serves assume way activity presently conducted gives any clue goals served past
foucault frequently criticized historians consider lack rigor analyses
example hans-ulrich wehler harshly criticized foucault 1998
wehler regards foucault bad philosopher wrongfully received good response humanities social sciences
according wehler foucault's works insufficient their empiric historical aspects also often contradictory lacking clarity
example foucault's concept power desperatingly undifferentiated foucault's thesis disciplinary society according wehler possible because foucault does properly differentiate authority force power violence legitimacy
addition thesis based one-sided choice sources prisons psychiatric institutions neglects other types organizations e
also wehler criticizes foucault's francocentrism because take consideration major german-speaking theorists social sciences like max weber norbert elias
wehler concludes foucault because endless series flaws so-called empirical studies
intellectually dishonest empirically absolutely unreliable crypto-normativist seducer postmodernism
feminist critiques though american feminists built foucault's critiques historical construction gender roles sexuality feminists accused androcentrism adopting exclusively male perspectives subjectivity ethics
queer theory foucault's approach sexuality understands sexualities socially constructed concepts ascribed onto bodies become widely influential example through work queer theorist judith butler eve sedgwick
nonetheless foucault's resistance identity politics rejection sexual object choice fixed foundation sexual behavior stands odds formulations queer gay identity
social constructionism human nature foucault sometimes criticized prominent formulation principles social constructionism see affront concept truth
foucault's 1971 televised debate noam chomsky foucault argued against possibility any fixed human nature posited chomsky's concept innate human faculties
chomsky argued concepts justice rooted human reason whereas foucault rejected universal basis concept justice
following debate chomsky stricken foucault's total rejection possibility universal morality stating struck me completely amoral i’d never met anyone totally amoral
