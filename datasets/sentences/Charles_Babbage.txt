babbage remarked skilled workers typically spend parts their time performing tasks below their skill level
labour process divided among several workers labour costs may cut assigning high-skill tasks high-cost workers restricting other tasks lower-paid workers

— babbage 1864 rejecting athanasian creed direct contradiction terms youth looked samuel clarke's works religion being attributes god 1704 exerted particularly strong influence

engineer inventor through royal society babbage acquired friendship engineer marc brunel
through brunel babbage knew joseph clement came encounter artisans whom observed work manufactures
babbage provided introduction isambard kingdom brunel 1830 contact proposed bristol & birmingham railway
carried out studies around 1838 show superiority broad gauge railways used brunel's great western railway
1838 babbage invented pilot also called cow-catcher metal frame attached front locomotives clears tracks obstacles also constructed dynamometer car
eldest son benjamin herschel babbage worked engineer brunel railways before emigrating australia 1850 s
babbage also invented ophthalmoscope gave thomas wharton jones testing

device came use after being independently invented hermann von helmholtz
cryptography babbage achieved notable results cryptography though still known century after death
letter frequency category 18 babbage's tabulation project

early 1845 babbage solved cipher posed challenge nephew henry hollier process made discovery ciphers based vigenère tables
specifically realized enciphering plain text keyword rendered cipher text subject modular arithmetic
during crimean war 1850 s babbage broke vigenère's autokey cipher well much weaker cipher called vigenère cipher today
discovery kept military secret published
credit result instead given friedrich kasiski prussian infantry officer made same discovery years later
however 1854 babbage published solution vigenère cipher published previously journal society arts
1855 babbage also published short letter cypher writing same journal
nevertheless priority wasn't established until 1985
public nuisances babbage involved himself well-publicised unpopular campaigns against public nuisances
once counted broken panes glass factory publishing 1857 table relative frequency causes breakage plate glass windows 464 broken panes 14 caused drunken men women boys
babbage's distaste commoners mob included writing observations street nuisances 1864 well tallying up 165 nuisances over period 80 days
especially hated street music particular music organ grinders against whom railed various venues
following quotation typical difficult estimate misery inflicted upon thousands persons absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes intellectual workers loss their time destroyed organ-grinders other similar nuisances
babbage alone campaign

1860 s babbage also took up anti-hoop-rolling campaign
blamed hoop-rolling boys driving their iron hoops under horses' legs result rider thrown very often horse breaks leg
babbage achieved certain notoriety matter being denounced debate commons 1864 commencing crusade against popular game tip-cat trundling hoops
computing pioneer part charles babbage's difference engine #1 assembled after death son henry prevost babbage 1824–1918 using parts found charles' laboratory babbage's machines among first mechanical computers
actually completed largely because funding problems clashes personality most notably airy astronomer royal
babbage directed building steam-powered machines achieved modest success suggesting calculations mechanised
ten years received government funding project amounted £17000 eventually treasury lost confidence
while babbage's machines mechanical unwieldy their basic architecture similar modern computer
