28 jerusalem scholem directly contrasted historiographical approach study jewish mysticism approach 19 th-century school wissenschaft des judentums science judaism sought submit study judaism discipline subjects such history philology philosophy
jewish mysticism seen judaism's weakest scholarly link
scholem story early research directed prominent rabbi expert kabbalah
seeing rabbi's many books subject scholem asked them trash? why waste my time reading nonsense like this? robinson 2000 p
396 analysis judaism carried out wissenschaft school flawed two ways according scholem studied judaism dead object rather living organism
consider proper foundations judaism non-rational force scholem's view made religion living thing
scholem's opinion mythical mystical components least important rational ones thought rather minutiae halakha truly living core judaism
particular disagreed considered martin buber's personalization kabbalistic concepts well argued inadequate approach jewish history hebrew language land israel
weltanschauung scholem research jewish mysticism separated historical context
starting something similar gegengeschichte friedrich nietzsche ended up including less normative aspects judaism public history
specifically scholem thought jewish history divided three periods during biblical period monotheism battles myth without completely defeating
during talmudic period institutions—for example notion magical power accomplishment sacraments—are removed favour purer concept divine transcendence
during medieval period impossibility reconciling abstract concept god greek philosophy personal god bible led jewish thinkers such maimonides try eliminate remaining myths modify figure living god
after time mysticism effort find again essence god their fathers became widespread
notion three periods interactions rational irrational elements judaism led scholem put forward controversial arguments
thought 17 th century messianic movement known sabbatianism developed lurianic kabbalah
order neutralize sabbatianism hasidism emerged hegelian synthesis
many those joined hasidic movement because seen orthodox congregation considered scandalous their community should associated heretical movement
same way scholem produced hypothesis source 13 th century kabbalah jewish gnosticism preceded christian gnosticism
historiographical approach scholem also involved linguistic theory
contrast buber scholem believed power language invoke supernatural phenomena
contrast walter benjamin put hebrew language privileged position respect other languages language capable revealing divine truth
scholem considered kabbalists interpreters pre-existent linguistic revelation
debate hannah arendt aftermath eichmann trial jerusalem scholem sharply criticised hannah arendt's book eichmann jerusalem report banality evil decried her lack ahavath yisrael solidarity jewish people
arendt responded she never loved any collective group she does love jewish people part them
bitter fight exchanged various articles made scholem break off ties arendt refuse forgive her
scholem hans paeschke knew hannah arendt she socialist half-communist
she zionist
am astounded her ability pronounce upon movements she once deeply engaged terms distance measured light years such sovereign heights
”[citation needed] various other israeli jewish academics also broke off ties arendt claiming her lack solidarity jewish people their time need appalling along her victimization various nazis
before eichmann trial scholem also opposed arendt's interpretation letters introduction illuminations walter benjamin marxist thinker predated new left
scholem benjamin essentially religious thinker whose turn marxism merely unfortunate inessential superficial expedient
