2015 selected member new york state writers hall fame
writing style characteristics most common impressions asimov's fiction work writing style extremely unornamented
1980 science fiction scholar james gunn professor emeritus english university kansas robot except two stories—liar! evidence—they stories character plays significant part
virtually plot develops conversation little any action
nor there great deal local color description any kind
dialogue best functional style best transparent
robot stories matter fact almost asimov fiction—play themselves relatively bare stage
gunn observes places asimov's style rises demands situation cites climax liar! example
sharply drawn characters occur key junctures storylines susan calvin liar! evidence arkady darell second foundation elijah baley caves steel hari seldon foundation prequels
asimov addresses criticism beginning book nemesis made up my mind long ago follow cardinal rule my writing—to 'clear'
given up thought writing poetically symbolically experimentally any other modes might good enough get me pulitzer prize
write merely clearly way establish warm relationship myself my readers professional critics—well whatever wish
other books gunn patrouch relative dearth literary criticism exists asimov particularly compared sheer volume output
cowart wymer's dictionary literary biography 1981 gives possible reason words easily lend themselves traditional literary criticism because habit centering fiction plot clearly stating reader rather direct terms happening stories why happening
fact most dialogue asimov story particularly foundation trilogy devoted such exposition
stories clearly state mean unambiguous language most difficult scholar deal because there little interpreted
[citation needed] fairness gunn's patrouch's respective studies asimov both take stand clear direct prose style still style
gunn's 1982 book goes considerable depth commenting upon each asimov's novels published date
does praise asimov's fiction nor does patrouch does call passages caves steel reminiscent proust
discussing how novel depicts night falling over futuristic new york city gunn says asimov's prose need ashamed anywhere literary society
[citation needed] although prided himself unornamented prose style credited clifford
simak early influence asimov also enjoyed giving longer stories complicated narrative structures often arranging chapters nonchronological ways
readers put off complaining nonlinearity worth trouble adversely affects clarity story
example first third gods themselves begins chapter 6 then backtracks fill earlier material
john campbell advised asimov begin stories late plot possible
advice helped asimov create reason early robot stories
see memory yet green details time period
patrouch found interwoven nested flashbacks currents space serious harm novel such extent dyed-in-the-kyrt asimov fan enjoy
asimov's tendency contort timelines perhaps most apparent later novel nemesis group characters lives present another group starts past beginning 15 years earlier gradually moving toward time period first group
[citation needed] limitations asimov sometimes criticized general absence sexuality extraterrestrial life science fiction
claimed gods themselves[citation needed] respond these criticisms often came new wave science fiction mostly british writers
second part three novel set alien world three sexes sexual behavior these creatures extensively depicted
alien life asimov once explained reluctance write aliens came incident early career astounding's editor john campbell rejected science fiction stories because alien characters portrayed superior humans
nature rejection led believe campbell may based bias towards humans stories real-world racial bias
unwilling write weak alien races concerned confrontation jeopardize campbell's friendship decided write aliens
nevertheless response these criticisms gods themselves contains aliens alien sex
book won nebula award best novel 1972 hugo award best novel 1973
asimov writings most proud middle section gods themselves part deals those themes
hugo award-winning novella gold asimov describes author clearly based himself books gods themselves adapted compu-drama essentially photo-realistic computer animation
director criticizes fictionalized asimov gregory laborian having extremely nonvisual style making difficult adapt work author explains relies ideas dialogue rather description get points across
[citation needed] gender social issues others criticized lack strong female characters early work
autobiographical writings such gold women science fiction acknowledges responds pointing inexperience
later novels written female characters essentially same prose style early sf stories brought matter wider audience
example august 25 1985 washington post's book world section reports robots empire follows 1940 asimov's humans stripped-down masculine portraits americans 1940 still
robots tin cans speedlines like old studebaker still robot tales depended increasingly unworkable distinction movable unmovable artificial intelligences still
asimov universe because conceived long time ago because author abhors confusion there no computers whose impact worth noting no social complexities no genetic engineering aliens arcologies multiverses clones sin sex heroes case r
daneel olivaw whom first met robot protagonist caves steel sequels feel no pressure information raw cooked simplest us today suffer no deformation winds asimov future because deeply strikingly orderly
naked sun 1957 deals social issues core part central setting motivation depicts genetic engineering guise eugenics fundamental part society presents reader inverted arcologies single person focal point artificial environment well hero hails normal arcology earth
meanwhile totally artificial birth although specifically cloning aim leaders society sexual want major driving force main female character albeit veiled 1950 s sensibilities entire story used make point too much order ultimately stagnant dead end avoided
[citation needed] views religion isaac asimov atheist humanist rationalist
oppose religious conviction others frequently railed against superstitious pseudoscientific beliefs tried pass themselves off genuine science
during childhood father mother observed orthodox jewish traditions though stringently petrovichi however force their beliefs upon young isaac
thus grew up without strong religious influences coming believe torah represented hebrew mythology same way iliad recorded greek mythology
books treasury humor asimov laughs again record asimov willing tell jokes involving god satan garden eden jerusalem other religious topics expressing viewpoint good joke provoke thought hours philosophical discussion
[citation needed] brief while father worked local synagogue enjoy familiar surroundings isaac put shine learned scholar versed sacred writings
scholarship seed later authorship publication asimov's guide bible analysis historic foundations both old new testaments
many years asimov called himself atheist however considered term somewhat inadequate described believe rather
eventually described himself humanist considered term practical
however continue identify himself nonobservant jew stated introduction jack dann's anthology jewish science fiction wandering stars attend no services follow no ritual never undergone curious puberty rite bar mitzvah
doesn't matter
am jewish
asked interview 1982 atheist asimov replied am atheist out out
took me long time say
i've atheist years years somehow felt intellectually unrespectable say atheist because assumed knowledge didn't
somehow better say humanist agnostic
finally decided i'm creature emotion well reason
emotionally am atheist
don't evidence prove god doesn't exist strongly suspect doesn't don't want waste my time
last volume autobiography asimov atheist believe god choose save people basis totality their lives pattern their words
think prefer honest righteous atheist tv preacher whose every word god god god whose every deed foul foul foul
same memoir states belief hell drooling dream sadist crudely affixed all-merciful god even human governments willing curtail cruel unusual punishments wondered asimov why punishment afterlife restricted limited term? asimov rejected idea human belief action merit infinite punishment
afterlife existed claimed longest most severe punishment reserved those slandered god inventing hell
politics asimov became staunch supporter democratic party during new deal thereafter remained political liberal
vocal opponent vietnam war 1960 s television interview during early 1970 s publicly endorsed george mc govern
unhappy considered irrationalist viewpoint taken many radical political activists late 1960 s onwards
second volume autobiography joy still felt asimov recalled meeting counterculture figure abbie hoffman
asimov's impression 1960 s' counterculture heroes ridden emotional wave end left them stranded no-man's land spirit wondered ever return
[citation needed] vehemently opposed richard nixon considering crook liar
followed unfolding events watergate day-to-day pleased president forced resign
dismayed over pardon extended nixon successor impressed argument spared nation ordeal
my way thinking ordeal necessary make certain never happen again
though asimov came jewish family appeared hold equivocal attitude towards israel
first autobiography indicates support safety israel though remaining careful insist no means zionist
however third autobiography clarifies position stating opposition creation jewish state grounds opposed concept nation states general supports notion single humanity
especially worries safety israel given created among hostile neighbours jews merely created themselves another jewish ghetto
social issues asimov considered himself feminist even before women's liberation became widespread movement joked wished women free because hate charge
