debate c
lewis young philosophy don anscombe acquired reputation formidable debater
1948 she presented paper meeting oxford's socratic club she disputed c
lewis's argument naturalism self-refuting found third chapter original publication book miracles
associates lewis primarily george sayer derek brewer remarked lewis lost subsequent debate her paper loss humiliating abandoned theological argument turned entirely devotional writing children's literature
anscombe's impression effect upon lewis somewhat different fact lewis rewrote chapter rewrote now those qualities [to meet anscombe's objections] shows honesty seriousness
meeting socratic club read my paper described several friends horrible shocking experience upset very much
neither dr
havard lewis me dinner few weeks later nor professor jack bennet remembered any such feelings lewis's part [
my own recollection occasion sober discussion certain quite definite criticisms lewis's rethinking rewriting showed thought accurate
am inclined construe odd accounts matter friends seem interested actual arguments subject-matter interesting example phenomenon called projection
result debate lewis substantially rewrote chapter 3 miracles 1960 paperback edition
work wittgenstein anscombe's most frequently cited works translations editions expositions work her teacher ludwig wittgenstein
she introduction 1959 wittgenstein's 1921 book tractatus logico-philosophicus brought fore importance gottlob frege wittgenstein's thought partly basis attacked positivist interpretations work
she co-edited posthumous second book philosophische untersuchungen/philosophical investigations 1953 rush rhees
her english translation book appeared simultaneously remains standard
she also edited co-edited several volumes selections notebooks translating them example remarks foundations mathematics 1956
1978 anscombe awarded austrian cross honour science art st class her work wittgenstein
intention her most important work monograph intention 1957
three volumes collected papers published 1981 parmenides wittgenstein metaphysics philosophy mind ethics religion politics
another collection human life action ethics appeared posthumously 2005
aim intention 1957 make plain character human action will
anscombe approaches matter through concept intention she notes three modes appearance our language she x'ing intentionally intentional action she x'ing intention doing
she x'ing intention further intention acting she intends
she expressed intention expression intention future davidson later called pure intending she suggests true account must somehow connect these three uses concept though later students intention sometimes denied disputed things she presupposes under first third headings
clear though second crucial her main purpose comprehend way human thought understanding conceptualisation relate events man's history goings subject
rather attempt define intentions abstraction actions thus taking third heading first anscombe begins concept intentional action
soon connected second heading
she says up human being intentional action question 'why' taken certain sense evidently conceived addressed application intention par
agent answer 'why' question giving reason purpose her action
because want typical answers sort why? though ones crucial constitution phenomenon typical phenomenon human life sections 18–21
agent's answer helps supply descriptions under action intentional
anscombe first clearly spell out actions intentional under descriptions others
her famous example man's action might observe consisting moving arm up down while holding handle may intentional under description 'pumping water' under other descriptions such 'contracting these muscles' 'tapping out rhythm'
approach action influenced donald davidson's theory despite fact davidson went argue causal theory action anscombe never accepted see anscombe 1981 well anscombe 1957
intention 1957 also classic source idea there difference 'direction fit' cognitive states like beliefs conative states like desire
theme later taken up discussed searle intentionality 1983
cognitive states describe world causally derived facts objects depict
conative states describe world aim bring something world
anscombe used example shopping list illustrate difference see intention 1957 par
list straightforward observational report actually bought thereby acting like cognitive state function conative state such command desire dictating agent should buy
agent fails buy listed say list untrue incorrect say mistake action belief
according anscombe difference direction fit major difference speculative knowledge theoretical empirical knowledge practical knowledge knowledge actions morals
whereas 'speculative knowledge' 'derived objects known' practical knowledge phrase anscombe lifts aquinas 'the cause understands
ethics anscombe made great contributions ethics well metaphysics
she credited having coined term consequentialism
her 1958 essay modern moral philosophy anscombe denial any distinction foreseen intended consequences far responsibility concerned made sidgwick developing any 'method ethics' made important move behalf everybody just own account think plausible suggest move part sidgwick explains difference old-fashioned utilitarianism consequentialism name marks every english academic moral philosopher since
modern moral philosophy credited reviving interest study virtue ethics western academic philosophy
brute institutional facts anscombe also introduced idea set facts being 'brute relative to' fact
set facts xyz stands relation fact subset out range subset among holds holds
thus fact paid something brute facts might handed cheque sum named price goods saying payment gave cash time gave me goods
there tends according anscombe institutional context gives point description 'a' 'a' itself description given someone shilling description institution money currency country
according her no brute facts xyz generally entail fact relative 'brute' except proviso under normal circumstances cannot mention things case made difference lf
set facts xyz
may brute relative fact itself set facts abc
brute relative further fact w
thus brute facts distinct class facts distinguished another class 'institutional facts' essential concept grasp here set facts being 'brute relative to' fact
term 'brute facts' major role play john searle's philosophy speech acts institutional reality
first person her paper first person follows up remarks wittgenstein coming now-notorious conclusion first-person pronoun does refer anything e
few people accept conclusion though position later adopted radical form david lewis paper important contribution work indexicals self-consciousness carried philosophers varied john perry peter strawson david kaplan gareth evans john mc dowell sebastian rödl
views her work philosopher candace vogler says anscombe's strength she writes catholic audience she presumes share certain fundamental beliefs she equally willing write people share her assumptions
2010 philosopher roger scruton anscombe perhaps last great philosopher writing english
mary warnock described her 2006 undoubted giant among women philosophers while john haldane she certainly good claim greatest woman philosopher whom know
