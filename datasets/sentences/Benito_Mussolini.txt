5 december 1914 mussolini denounced orthodox socialism failing recognize war made national identity loyalty significant class distinction
fully demonstrated transformation speech acknowledged nation entity notion rejected prior war saying nation disappeared
used believe concept totally without substance
instead see nation arise palpitating reality before us!
class cannot destroy nation
class reveals itself collection interests—but nation history sentiments traditions language culture race
class become integral part nation cannot eclipse other
class struggle vain formula without effect consequence wherever finds people integrated itself proper linguistic racial confines—where national problem definitely resolved
such circumstances class movement finds itself impaired inauspicious historic climate
mussolini continued promote need revolutionary vanguard elite lead society
no longer advocated proletarian vanguard instead vanguard led dynamic revolutionary people any social class
though denounced orthodox socialism class conflict maintained time nationalist socialist supporter legacy nationalist socialists italy's history such giuseppe garibaldi giuseppe mazzini carlo pisacane
italian socialist party support orthodox socialism claimed failure member party revitalize transform recognize contemporary reality revealed hopelessness orthodox socialism outdated failure
perception failure orthodox socialism light outbreak world war solely held mussolini other pro-interventionist italian socialists such filippo corridoni sergio panunzio also denounced classical marxism favor intervention
these basic political views principles formed basis mussolini's newly formed political movement fasci rivoluzionari d'azione internazionalista 1914 called themselves fascisti fascists

mussolini admired republic often read inspiration
republic held number ideas fascism promoted such rule elite promoting state ultimate end opposition democracy protecting class system promoting class collaboration rejection egalitarianism promoting militarization nation creating class warriors demanding citizens perform civic duties interest state utilizing state intervention education promote creation warriors future rulers state
republic differed fascism promote aggressive war defensive war
also unlike fascism promoted very communist-like views property
plato idealist focused achieving justice morality while mussolini fascism realist focused achieving political goals
basic underlying idea behind mussolini's foreign policy spazio vitale vital space concept fascism analogous lebensraum german national socialism
concept spazio vitale first announced 1919 entire mediterranean especially so-called julian march redefined make appear unified region belonged italy times ancient roman province italia claimed italy's exclusive sphere influence
right colonize neighboring slovene ethnic areas mediterranean being inhabited alleged less developed peoples justified grounds italy suffering overpopulation
borrowing idea first developed enrico corradini before 1914 natural conflict plutocratic nations like britain proletarian nations like italy mussolini claimed italy's principal problem plutocratic countries like britain blocking italy achieving necessary spazio vitale let italian economy grow
mussolini equated nation's potential economic growth territorial size thus view problem poverty italy solved winning necessary spazio vitale
though biological racism less prominent fascism national socialism right start there strong racist undercurrent spazio vitale concept mussolini asserted there natural law stronger peoples subject dominate inferior peoples such barbaric slavic peoples yugoslavia mussolini claimed september 1920 speech mussolini stated dealing such race slavic — inferior barbarian — must pursue carrot stick policy
should afraid new victims
italian border should run across brenner pass monte nevoso dinaric alps
say easily sacrifice 500000 barbaric slavs 50000 italians
— benito mussolini speech held pula 20 september 1920 during period occupation years 1918 1920 five hundred slav societies example sokol slightly smaller number libraries reading rooms forbidden specifically later law associations 1925 law public demonstrations 1926 law public order 1926 closure classical lyceum pazin high school voloska 1918 closure five hundred slovene croatian primary schools followed
thousand slav teachers forcibly exiled sardinia elsewhere southern italy
same way mussolini argued italy right follow imperalist policy africa because black people inferior whites
mussolini claimed world divided hierarchy races stirpe though justified cultural biological grounds history nothing darwinian struggle power territory various racial masses
very fact italy suffering overpopulation seen proving cultural spiritual vitality italians thus justified seeking colonize lands mussolini argued historical basis belonged italy anyway heir roman empire
mussolini's thinking demography destiny nations rising populations nations destined conquer nations falling populations decaying powers deserved die
hence importance natalism mussolini since increasing birth rate italy ensure future great power win spazio vitale assured
mussolini's reckoning italian population reach 60 million enable italy fight major war—hence relentless demands italian women children reach number
mussolini fascists managed simultaneously revolutionary traditionalist because vastly different anything else political climate time sometimes described third way

almost certainly correct perception given ideology fascism emphasis moral benefits war lead conclusion italy without big stick best speak very very softly
contrary new regime drew opposite conclusion
noisy eloquence rabid journalism might substituted serious preparations war procedure harmless enough no took any seriously certain road disaster once outside mussolini inside country came believe eight million bayonets duce's imagination actually existed

historians still divided reasons attack ethiopia 1935
italian historians such franco catalano giorgio rochat argue invasion act social imperialism contending great depression badly damaged mussolini's prestige needed foreign war distract public opinion
other historians such pietro pastorelli argued invasion launched part expansionist program make italy main power red sea area middle east

mussolini's view move typically hypocritical action carried out decaying imperial powers intended prevent natural expansion younger poorer nations like italy
fact although france britain already colonized parts africa committed atrocities their colonies scramble africa finished beginning twentieth century
international mood now against colonialist expansion italy's actions condemned
furthermore italy criticized use mustard gas phosgene against enemies also zero tolerance approach enemy guerrillas authorized mussolini
