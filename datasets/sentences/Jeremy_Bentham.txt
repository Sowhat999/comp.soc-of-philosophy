philosophy utilitarianism took fundamental axiom greatest happiness greatest number measure right wrong
bentham claimed borrowed concept writings joseph priestley although closest priestley fact came expressing form good happiness members majority members any state great standard every thing relating state must finally determined
greatest happiness principle principle utility forms cornerstone bentham's thought
happiness understood predominance pleasure over pain

kelly argued utilitarianism distributive justice jeremy bentham civil law bentham theory justice prevented such consequences
according kelly bentham law provides basic framework social interaction delimiting spheres personal inviolability within individuals form pursue their own conceptions well-being
provides security precondition formation expectations
hedonic calculus shows expectation utilities much higher natural ones follows bentham does favour sacrifice few benefit many
bentham's introduction principles morals legislation focuses principle utility how view morality ties legislative practices
principle utility regards good produces greatest amount pleasure minimum amount pain evil produces most pain without pleasure
concept pleasure pain defined bentham physical well spiritual
bentham writes principle manifests itself within legislation society
lays down set criteria measuring extent pain pleasure certain decision will create
criteria divided categories intensity duration certainty proximity productiveness purity extent
using these measurements reviews concept punishment should used far whether punishment will create pleasure pain society
calls legislators determine whether punishment creates even evil offence
instead suppressing evil acts bentham argues certain unnecessary laws punishments ultimately lead new dangerous vices those being punished begin calls upon legislators measure pleasures pains associated any legislation form laws order create greatest good greatest number
argues concept individual pursuing her own happiness cannot necessarily declared right because often these individual pursuits lead greater pain less pleasure society whole
therefore legislation society vital maintain maximum pleasure minimum degree pain greatest number people

lobbied hard formation codification commissions both england united states went far write president james madison 1811 volunteer write complete legal code young country
after learned american law realized most state-based promptly governors every single state same offer
during lifetime bentham's codification efforts completely unsuccessful
even today completely rejected almost every common law jurisdiction including england
however writings subject laid foundation moderately successful codification work david dudley field ii united states generation later
animal rights bentham widely regarded earliest proponents animal rights even hailed first patron saint animal rights
argued ability suffer ability reason should benchmark called insuperable line
reason alone criterion judge ought rights human infants adults certain forms disability might fall short too
1789 alluding limited degree legal protection afforded slaves french west indies code noir day am sad say many places yet past greater part species under denomination slaves treated law exactly upon same footing england example inferior races animals still
day may come rest animal creation may acquire those rights never witholden them hand tyranny

else should trace insuperable line? faculty reason perhaps faculty discourse? full-grown horse dog beyond comparison rational well conversable animal infant day week even month old
suppose case otherwise avail? question reason? nor talk? suffer? earlier paragraph bentham makes clear accepted animals killed food defence human life provided animal made suffer unnecessarily
bentham object medical experiments animals providing experiments mind particular goal benefit humanity reasonable chance achieving goal
otherwise decided insuperable objection causing pain animals part because harmful effects such practices might human beings
letter editor morning chronicle march 1825 never seen nor ever see any objection putting dogs other inferior animals pain way medical experiment experiment determinate object beneficial mankind accompanied fair prospect accomplishment
decided insuperable objection putting them pain without any such view
my apprehension every act without prospect preponderant good pain knowingly willingly produced any being whatsoever act cruelty like other bad habits correspondent habit indulged stronger grows frequently productive bad fruit
