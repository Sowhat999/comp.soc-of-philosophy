attended liceo classico cavour turin enrolled university turin 1876 graduating 1880 high honors after university employed assist first enrico d'ovidio then angelo genocchi chair calculus
due genocchi's poor health peano took over teaching calculus course within 2 years
first major work textbook calculus published 1884 credited genocchi
few years later peano published first book dealing mathematical logic
here modern symbols union intersection sets appeared first time
giuseppe peano wife carola crosio 1887 1887 peano married carola crosio daughter turin-based painter luigi crosio known painting refugium peccatorum madonna
1886 began teaching concurrently royal military academy promoted professor first class 1889
next year university turin also granted full professorship
peano's famous space-filling curve appeared 1890 counterexample
used show continuous curve cannot enclosed arbitrarily small region
early example came known fractal
1890 peano founded journal rivista di matematica published first issue january 1891
1891 peano started formulario project
encyclopedia mathematics containing known formulae theorems mathematical science using standard notation invented peano
1897 first international congress mathematicians held zürich
peano key participant presenting paper mathematical logic
also started become increasingly occupied formulario detriment other work
1898 presented note academy binary numeration ability used represent sounds languages
also became frustrated publishing delays due demand formulae printed line purchased printing press
“ [peano] man greatly admired moment met first time 1900 congress philosophy dominated exactness mind
— bertrand russell 1932 paris venue second international congress mathematicians 1900
conference preceded first international conference philosophy peano member patronage committee
presented paper posed question correctly formed definitions mathematics
how you define definition?
became peano's main philosophical interests rest life
conference peano met bertrand russell gave copy formulario
russell struck peano's innovative logical symbols left conference returned home study peano's text
peano's students mario pieri alessandro padoa papers presented philosophy congress also
mathematical congress peano speak padoa's memorable presentation frequently recalled
resolution calling formation international auxiliary language facilitate spread mathematical commercial ideas proposed peano fully supported
1901 peano peak mathematical career
made advances areas analysis foundations logic made many contributions teaching calculus also contributed fields differential equations vector analysis
peano played key role axiomatization mathematics leading pioneer development mathematical logic
peano stage become heavily involved formulario project teaching began suffer
fact became determined teach new mathematical symbols calculus course neglected
result dismissed royal military academy retained post turin university
1903 peano announced work international auxiliary language called latino sine flexione latin without inflexion later called interlingua should confused later interlingua iala
important project along finding contributors 'formulario'
idea use latin vocabulary since widely known simplify grammar much possible remove irregular anomalous forms make easier learn
speech started speaking latin described each simplification introduced speech end talking new language
year 1908 important peano
fifth final edition formulario project titled formulario mathematico published
contained 4200 formulae theorems completely stated most them proved
book received little attention since much content dated time
however remains significant contribution mathematical literature
comments examples written latino sine flexione
also 1908 peano took over chair higher analysis turin appointment last two years
elected director academia pro interlingua
having previously created idiom neutral academy effectively chose abandon favor peano's latino sine flexione
after mother died 1910 peano divided time teaching working texts aimed secondary schooling including dictionary mathematics developing promoting other auxiliary languages becoming revered member international auxiliary language movement
used membership accademia dei lincei present papers written friends colleagues members accademia recorded published presented papers given sessions
during years 1913–1918 peano published several papers dealt remainder term various numerical quadrature formulas introduced peano kernel
1925 peano switched chairs unofficially infinitesimal calculus complementary mathematics field better suited current style mathematics
move became official 1931
giuseppe peano continued teaching turin university until day before died suffered fatal heart attack
milestones honors received 1881 published first paper
1884 calcolo differenziale e principii di calcolo integrale
1887 applicazioni geometriche del calcolo infinitesimale
1889 appointed professor first class royal military academy
1889 arithmetices principia nova methodo exposita 1890 appointed extraordinary professor infinitesimal calculus university turin
1891 made member academy science torino
1893 lezioni di analisi infinitesimale 2 vols
1895 promoted ordinary professor
1901 made knight order saints maurizio lazzaro
1903 announces latino sine flexione
