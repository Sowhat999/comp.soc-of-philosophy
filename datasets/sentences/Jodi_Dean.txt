communist horizon first two provocative chapters her book communist horizon jodi dean surveys contemporary political landscape notes persistence anti-communist rhetoric twenty-five years after fall berlin wall
capitalists conservatives liberals democrats social democrats even “radical democrats” embrace idea 20 th century experiments communism unqualified failure doing limit ability discuss political alternatives liberal democracy free markets fusion democracy capitalism dean calls “neoliberalism”
dean asserts people think capitalism think worst excesses war imperialism slavery robber barons great depression global financial crisis etc
history capitalism allowed dynamic nuanced
contrast utters word “communism” there no dynamism nuance
single story emerges links word “communism” fixed simplistic historical narrative
dean argues “communism” equals soviet union
communist experiments eastern europe asia africa latin american never mentioned
second dean asserts entire seventy-year history ussr collapsed twenty-six years joseph stalin’s rule
third stalin’s violence purges great famines labor camps events allowed represent ideal “communism” ignoring modernization economy successes soviet science including space program general increase standard living once predominantly peasant society
fourth collapse soviet union triumph liberal democracy free markets follows directly totalitarian nature stalinism political economic rigidity
thus singular experience stalinism soviet union becomes basis upon discussions alternatives neoliberalism silenced
stalinism serves “proof” communism never work practice because any challenge political status quo will inevitably end purges gulag

engages small convinced group intellectuals take solace unadulterated leninism largely ignore best traditions twentieth-century marxism—which recognized pluralistic character social formations political identities complexity state especially ethical political importance democracy
writing international socialist review shaun harkin also questions dean’s unwillingness engage real problems posed stalinism radical left
book argues offers “no analysis failings crimes stalinism committed name marxism communism no analysis why therefore many looked toward radical alternative turned away communism commonly perceived
harkin concludes dean's contribution ‘rethink communism today critique learn past order instantiate something better time’
deeply marred her failure adopt left marxist critique stalinism
