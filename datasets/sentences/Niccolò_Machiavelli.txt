machiavelli's best-known book il principe contains several maxims concerning politics
instead traditional target audience hereditary prince concentrates possibility new prince
retain power hereditary prince must carefully balance interests variety institutions people accustomed
contrast new prince difficult task ruling must first stabilize newfound power order build enduring political structure
machiavelli suggests social benefits stability security achieved face moral corruption
machiavelli believed public private morality understood two different things order rule well
result ruler must concerned reputation also must positively willing act immorally right times
political theorist machiavelli emphasized occasional need methodical exercise brute force deceit including extermination entire noble families head off any chance challenge prince's authority
engraved portrait machiavelli peace palace library's il principe published 1769 scholars often note machiavelli glorifies instrumentality statebuilding approach embodied saying ends justify means
should noted quote disputed may come niccolò machiavelli writings
violence may necessary successful stabilization power introduction new legal institutions
force may used eliminate political rivals coerce resistant populations purge community other men strong enough character rule will inevitably attempt replace ruler
machiavelli become infamous such political advice ensuring remembered history through adjective machiavellian
notwithstanding mitigating themes catholic church banned prince putting index librorum prohibitorum
humanists also viewed book negatively including erasmus rotterdam
treatise primary intellectual contribution history political thought fundamental break political realism political idealism due being manual acquiring keeping political power
contrast plato aristotle machiavelli insisted imaginary ideal society model prince should orient himself
concerning differences similarities machiavelli's advice ruthless tyrannical princes prince republican exhortations discourses livy many concluded prince although written advice monarchical prince contains arguments superiority republican regimes similar those found discourses
18 th century work even called satire example jean-jacques rousseau
recently commentators such leo strauss harvey mansfield agreed prince read having deliberate comical irony
other interpretations include example antonio gramsci argued machiavelli's audience work even ruling class common people because rulers already knew these methods through their education
discourses livy main article discourses livy discourses first ten books titus livy published 1531 written 1517 often referred simply discourses discorsi nominally discussion regarding classical history early ancient rome although strays very far subject matter also uses contemporary political examples illustrate points
machiavelli presents series lessons how republic should started structured
larger work prince while openly explains advantages republics also contains many similar themes
commentators disagree how much two works agree each other frequently referring leaders democracies princes
includes early versions concept checks balances asserts superiority republic over principality
became central texts republicanism often argued superior work prince

machiavelli's literary executor giuliano de' ricci also reported having seen machiavelli grandfather made comedy style aristophanes included living florentines characters titled le maschere
suggested due such things style writing superiors generally there very likely animosity machiavelli even before return medici
originality commentators taken very different approaches machiavelli agreed
major discussion tended two issues first how unified philosophical work second concerning how innovative traditional
coherence there disagreement concerning how best describe unifying themes there any found machiavelli's works especially two major political works prince discourses
commentators described inconsistent perhaps even putting high priority consistency
others such hans baron argued ideas must changed dramatically over time
argued conclusions best understood product times experiences education
others such leo strauss harvey mansfield argued strongly there very strong deliberate consistency distinctness even arguing extends machiavelli's works including comedies letters
influences commentators such leo strauss gone far name machiavelli deliberate originator modernity itself
others argued machiavelli particularly interesting example trends happening around
any case machiavelli presented himself various times someone reminding italians old virtues romans greeks other times someone promoting completely new approach politics
machiavelli wide range influences itself controversial
their relative importance however subject on-going discussion
possible summarize main influences emphasized different commentators
mirror princes genre
gilbert 1938 summarized similarities prince genre obviously imitates so-called mirror princes style
classically influenced genre models least far back xenophon isocrates still quite popular during machiavelli's life
while gilbert emphasizes similarities however agrees other commentators machiavelli particularly novel way used genre even compared contemporaries such baldassare castiglione erasmus
major innovations gilbert noted machiavelli focused upon deliberate purpose dealing new ruler will need establish himself defiance custom
normally these types works addressed hereditary princes
xenophon also exception regard
classical republicanism
commentators such quentin skinner j
pocock so-called cambridge school interpretation able show republican themes machiavelli's political works particularly discourses livy found medieval italian literature influenced classical authors such sallust
xenophon author cyropedia
classical political philosophy xenophon plato aristotle
socratic school classical political philosophy especially aristotle become major influence upon european political thinking late middle ages
existed both catholicised form presented thomas aquinas controversial averroist form authors like marsilius padua
machiavelli critical catholic political thinking may influenced averroism
cites plato aristotle very infrequently apparently approve them
leo strauss argued strong influence xenophon student socrates known historian rhetorician soldier major source socratic ideas machiavelli sometimes line aristotle
while interest plato increasing florence during machiavelli's lifetime also does show particular interest indirectly influenced readings authors such polybius plutarch cicero
major difference machiavelli socratics according strauss machiavelli's materialism therefore rejection both teleological view nature view philosophy higher politics
aimed-for things socratics argued tend happen nature machiavelli happen chance
classical materialism
strauss argued machiavelli may seen himself influenced ideas classical materialists such democritus epicurus lucretius
strauss however sees also sign major innovation machiavelli because classical materialists share socratic regard political life while machiavelli clearly
scholars note similarity machiavelli greek historian thucydides since both emphasized power politics
strauss argued machiavelli may indeed influenced pre-socratic philosophers felt new combination-
contemporary readers reminded machiavelli's teaching thucydides find both authors same realism
same denial power gods justice same sensitivity harsh necessity elusive chance
yet thucydides never calls question intrinsic superiority nobility baseness superiority shines forth particularly noble destroyed base
therefore thucydides' history arouses reader sadness never aroused machiavelli's books
machiavelli find comedies parodies satires nothing reminding tragedy
half humanity remains outside thought
there no tragedy machiavelli because no sense sacredness common
— strauss 1958 p
292 beliefs amongst commentators there few consistently made proposals concerning most new machiavelli's work
empiricism realism versus idealism machiavelli sometimes seen prototype modern empirical scientist building generalizations experience historical facts emphasizing uselessness theorizing imagination
emancipated politics theology moral philosophy
undertook describe simply rulers actually thus anticipated later called scientific spirit questions good bad ignored observer attempts discover really happens
— joshua kaplan 2005 machiavelli felt early schooling along lines traditional classical education essentially useless purpose understanding politics
nevertheless advocated intensive study past particularly regarding founding city felt key understanding later development
moreover studied way people lived aimed inform leaders how should rule even how themselves should live
example machiavelli denies living virtuously necessarily leads happiness
machiavelli viewed misery vices enables prince rule
machiavelli stated best both loved feared
since two rarely come together anyone compelled choose will find greater security being feared being loved
much machiavelli's work seems ruler must adopt unsavory policies sake continuance regime
related controversial proposal often made described how things politics way seemed neutral concerning used advice—tyrants good rulers
machiavelli strove realism doubted four centuries scholars debated how best describe morality
prince made word machiavellian byword deceit despotism political manipulation
even machiavelli himself evil leo strauss declared himself inclined toward traditional view machiavelli self-consciously teacher evil since counsels princes avoid values justice mercy temperance wisdom love their people preference use cruelty violence fear deception
italian anti-fascist philosopher benedetto croce 1925 concludes machiavelli simply realist pragmatist accurately states moral values reality greatly affect decisions political leaders make
german philosopher ernst cassirer 1946 held machiavelli simply adopts stance political scientist—a galileo politics—in distinguishing facts political life values moral judgment
other hand walter russell mead argued prince's advice presupposes importance ideas like legitimacy making changes political system
fortune machiavelli generally seen being critical christianity existed time specifically effect upon politics also everyday life
opinion christianity along teleological aristotelianism church come accept allowed practical decisions guided too much imaginary ideals encouraged people lazily leave events up providence put chance luck fortune
while christianity sees modesty virtue pride sinful machiavelli took classical position seeing ambition spiritedness pursuit glory good natural things part virtue prudence good princes should
therefore while traditional say leaders should virtues especially prudence machiavelli's use words virtù prudenza unusual time implying spirited immodest ambition
famously machiavelli argued virtue prudence help man control future place allowing fortune
najemy 1993 argued same approach found machiavelli's approach love desire seen comedies correspondence
najemy shows how machiavelli's friend vettori argued against machiavelli cited traditional understanding fortune
other hand humanism machiavelli's time meant classical pre-christian ideas virtue prudence including possibility trying control one's future unique
humanists go far promote extra glory deliberately aiming establish new state defiance traditions laws
while machiavelli's approach classical precedents argued just bring back old ideas machiavelli typical humanist
strauss 1958 argues way machiavelli combines classical ideas new
while xenophon plato also described realistic politics closer machiavelli aristotle like aristotle also saw philosophy something higher politics
machiavelli apparently materialist objected explanations involving formal final causation teleology
machiavelli's promotion ambition among leaders while denying any higher standard meant encouraged risk taking innovation most famously founding new modes orders
advice princes therefore certainly limited discussing how maintain state
argued machiavelli's promotion innovation led directly argument progress aim politics civilization
while belief humanity control own future control nature progress long lasting machiavelli's followers starting own friend guicciardini tended prefer peaceful progress through economic development warlike progress
harvey mansfield 1995 p
74 attempting other regular scientific modes overcoming fortune machiavelli's successors formalized emasculated notion virtue
machiavelli however along classical predecessors saw ambition spiritedness therefore war inevitable part human nature
strauss concludes 1958 thoughts machiavelli proposing promotion progress leads directly modern arms race
strauss argued unavoidable nature such arms races existed before modern times led collapse peaceful civilizations provides us both explanation most truly dangerous machiavelli's innovations also way aims apparently immoral innovation understood
religion machiavelli explains repeatedly religion man-made value religion lies contribution social order rules morality must dispensed security requires
prince discourses life castruccio castracani describes prophets calls them like moses romulus cyrus great theseus treated pagan christian patriarchs same way greatest new princes glorious brutal founders most novel innovations politics men whom machiavelli assures us used large amount armed force murder against their own people
estimated these sects last 1666 3000 years each time pointed out leo strauss mean christianity became due start finishing 150 years after machiavelli
machiavelli's concern christianity sect makes men weak inactive delivering politics hands cruel wicked men without fight
while fear god replaced fear prince there strong enough prince machiavelli felt having religion any case especially essential keeping republic order
machiavelli truly great prince never conventionally religious himself should make people religious
according strauss 1958 pp
226–227 first person ever explain religion way description religion novel because way integrated general account princes
machiavelli's judgment democracies need religion practical political reasons widespread among modern proponents republics until approximately time french revolution
therefore represents point disagreement himself late modernity
positive side factional individual vice despite classical precedents machiavelli promote time machiavelli's realism willingness argue good ends justify bad things seen critical stimulus towards most important theories modern politics
firstly particularly discourses livy machiavelli unusual positive side sometimes seems describe factionalism republics
example quite early discourses book chapter 4 chapter title announces disunion plebs senate rome kept rome free
community different components whose interests must balanced any good regime idea classical precedents machiavelli's particularly extreme presentation seen critical step towards later political ideas both division powers checks balances ideas lay behind us constitution well many other modern state constitutions
similarly modern economic argument capitalism most modern forms economics often stated form public virtue private vices
also case even though there classical precedents machiavelli's insistence being both realistic ambitious admitting vice exists being willing risk encouraging critical step path insight
mansfield however argues machiavelli's own aims shared those influenced
machiavelli argued against seeing mere peace economic growth worthy aims their own lead mansfield calls taming prince
machiavellian see also machiavellianism machiavellian intelligence cesare borgia used example successful ruler prince
machiavelli most famous short political treatise prince written 1513 published until 1532 five years after death
although privately circulated prince among friends theoretical work printed lifetime art war military science
since 16 th century generations politicians remain attracted repelled apparently neutral acceptance even positive encouragement immorality powerful men described especially prince also other works
works sometimes even contributed modern negative connotations words politics politician sometimes thought because old nick became english term devil
obviously adjective machiavellian became pejorative term describing someone aims deceive manipulate others personal advantage
machiavellianism also remains popular term used speeches journalism while psychology denotes personality type
while machiavellianism notable works machiavelli machiavelli's works complex generally agreed just machiavellian himself
example j
pocock 1975 saw major source republicanism spread throughout england north america 17 th 18 th centuries leo strauss 1958 whose view machiavelli quite different many ways agreed machiavelli's influence republicanism argued even though machiavelli teacher evil nobility spirit led advocate ignoble actions
whatever intentions still debated today become associated any proposal end justifies means
example leo strauss 1958 p
297 machiavelli political thinker whose name come common use designating kind politics exists will continue exist independently influence politics guided exclusively considerations expediency uses means fair foul iron poison achieving ends—its end being aggrandizement one's country fatherland—but also using fatherland service self-aggrandizement politician statesman one's party
influence quote robert bireley
there circulation approximately fifteen editions prince nineteen discourses french translations each before placed index paul iv 1559 measure nearly stopped publication catholic areas except france
three principal writers took field against machiavelli publication works their condemnation 1559 again tridentine index 1564
these english cardinal reginald pole portuguese bishop jeronymo osorio both whom lived many years italy italian humanist later bishop ambrogio caterino politi
machiavelli's ideas profound impact political leaders throughout modern west helped new technology printing press
during first generations after machiavelli main influence non-republican governments
pole reported prince spoken highly thomas cromwell england influenced henry viii turn towards protestantism tactics example during pilgrimage grace
copy also possessed catholic king emperor charles v
france after initially mixed reaction machiavelli came associated catherine de' medici st
bartholomew's day massacre
bireley 199017 reports 16 th century catholic writers associated machiavelli protestants whereas protestant authors saw italian catholic
fact apparently influencing both catholic protestant kings
most important early works dedicated criticism machiavelli especially prince huguenot innocent gentillet whose work commonly referred discourse against machiavelli anti machiavel published geneva 1576
accused machiavelli being atheist accused politicians time saying works koran courtiers no reputation court france hath machiavel's writings fingers ends
another theme gentillet spirit machiavelli himself questioned effectiveness immoral strategies just machiavelli himself done despite also explaining how sometimes work
became theme much future political discourse europe during 17 th century
includes catholic counter reformation writers summarised bireley giovanni botero justus lipsius carlo scribani adam contzen pedro de ribadeneira diego saavedra fajardo
these authors criticized machiavelli also followed many ways
accepted need prince concerned reputation even need cunning deceit compared machiavelli like later modernist writers emphasized economic progress much riskier ventures war
these authors tended cite tacitus their source realist political advice rather machiavelli pretense came known tacitism
black tacitism support princely rule red tacitism arguing case republics original spirit machiavelli himself became increasingly important
francis bacon argued case become modern science based upon real experience experimentation free assumptions metaphysics aimed increasing control nature
named machiavelli predecessor
modern materialist philosophy developed 16 th 17 th 18 th centuries starting generations after machiavelli
philosophy tended republican original spirit machiavellian catholic authors machiavelli's realism encouragement using innovation try control one's own fortune accepted emphasis upon war politics
innovative economics politics result also modern science leading commentators say 18 th century enlightenment involved humanitarian moderating machiavellianism
importance machiavelli's influence notable many important figures endeavor example bodin francis bacon algernon sidney harrington john milton spinoza rousseau hume edward gibbon adam smith
although mentioned name inspiration due controversy also thought influence other major philosophers such montaigne descartes hobbes locke montesquieu
although seems outlandish think machiavelli influenced political theorists such jean-jacques rousseau certainly agree machiavelli's theories literal sense important view machiavelli's work different points view rather just traditional notion
example rousseau viewed machiavelli's work satirical piece machiavelli exposes faults one-man rule rather exalting amorality
seventeenth century england machiavelli's ideas most substantially developed adapted republicanism came once life out seventeenth-century english republicanism there emerge next century theme english political historical reflection—of writings bolingbroke circle gibbon early parliamentary radicals—but stimulus enlightenment scotland continent america
scholars argued machiavelli major indirect direct influence upon political thinking founding fathers united states due overwhelming favoritism republicanism republic type government
according john mc cormick still very much debatable whether machiavelli advisor tyranny partisan liberty
benjamin franklin james madison thomas jefferson followed machiavelli's republicanism opposed saw emerging aristocracy feared alexander hamilton creating federalist party
hamilton learned machiavelli importance foreign policy domestic policy may broken regarding how rapacious republic needed order survive george washington probably less influenced machiavelli
however founding father perhaps most studied valued machiavelli political philosopher john adams profusely commented italian's thought work defence constitutions government united states america
defence constitutions government united states john adams praised machiavelli algernon sidney montesquieu philosophic defender mixed government
adams machiavelli restored empirical reason politics while analysis factions commendable
adams likewise agreed florentine human nature immutable driven passions
also accepted machiavelli's belief societies subject cyclical periods growth decay
adams machiavelli lacked clear understanding institutions necessary good government
20 th century 20 th-century italian communist antonio gramsci drew great inspiration machiavelli's writings ethics morals how relate state revolution writings passive revolution how society manipulated controlling popular notions morality
