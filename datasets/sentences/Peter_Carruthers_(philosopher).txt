notable ideas role language cognition there spectrum opinions role language cognition
extreme philosophers like michael dummett argued thought impossible absence language social scientists influenced benjamin whorf believed natural languages people grow up speaking will profound influence character their thoughts
other extreme philosophers like jerry fodor together most cognitive scientists believed language input/output device cognition playing no significant role thought itself
peter carruthers steered path these two extremes
1996 book allowed much thought does occur absence language while arguing constitutive role language conscious thinking conducted inner speech
2006 book position broadened deepened
following antonio damasio argues mental rehearsals action issue imagery plays profound role human practical reasoning inner speech now being seen subset action rehearsal
carruthers now argues serial use these rehearsals issue whole new level thinking reasoning serving realize “dual systems” psychologists like daniel kahneman believe involved human reasoning processes
massive modularity human mind evolutionary psychologists evolutionary psychology like leda cosmides john tooby steven pinker claimed mind consists great many distinct functionally specialized systems modules
jerry fodor argued contrast central processes mind judging reasoning deciding forth cannot modular
2006 book peter carruthers lays out main case supporting massive modularity shows how notion module context should properly understood takes up fodor’s challenge showing how distinctive flexibility creativity rationality human mind result interactions massive numbers modules
dispositional higher-order thought theory consciousness amongst philosophers think consciousness admits explanation most popular approach other variety representationalism
representationalists hold distinctive features consciousness explained appeal representational contents together causal roles experience
first-order representationalists like fred dretske michael tye philosopher believe relevant contents world-directed ones colors sounds forth distinctive sort non-conceptual analog fine-grained
higher-order representationalists like william lycan david m
rosenthal peter carruthers contrast maintain need aware undergoing these first-order experiences order latter qualify conscious
carruthers’ view awareness question dispositional
virtue experience being available higher-order thought claimed acquire higher-order non-conceptual content
hence conscious experiences dual content while representing world us also represent themselves us
conscious experiences thus held self-representational ones
denial introspection thoughts most people philosophers non-philosophers alike assume direct introspective access their own propositional attitude events judging deciding forth[citation needed]
think ourselves knowing our own thought processes immediately without having interpret ourselves way need interpret behavior circumstances other people know thinking
series recent papers peter carruthers argued introspective intuition illusory
while allowing introspective access our own experiences including imagistic experiences sort occur during inner speech draws evidence across cognitive sciences argue our knowledge our own judgments decisions results us turning our interpretative skills upon ourselves
also argues while inner speech plays important roles human cognition never plays right sort role constitute judgment decision
latter processes occur below surface consciousness carruthers claims
