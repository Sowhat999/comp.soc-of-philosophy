june 1942 — assisted mills miller — focused attention developing effective method restricted burning using solid rocket fuel military demanded jatos provide over 100 pounds thrust without any risk exploding
although solid fuels such galcit-27 less volatile their liquid counterparts disfavored military jato use provided less immediate thrust versatility being turned off mid-flight
parsons tried resolve galcit-27's volatility issue gaclit-46 replaced former's ammonium nitrate guanidine nitrate
