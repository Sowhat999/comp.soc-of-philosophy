model decision making am proposing following feature faced important decision consideration-generator whose output degree undetermined produces series considerations may course immediately rejected irrelevant agent consciously unconsciously
those considerations selected agent having negligible bearing decision then figure reasoning process agent main reasonable those considerations ultimately serve predictors explicators agent's final decision
while other philosophers developed two-stage models including william james henri poincaré arthur holly compton henry margenau dennett defends model following reasons first
intelligent selection rejection weighing considerations occur subject matter intelligence making difference
second think installs indeterminism right place libertarian there right place
point view biological engineering just efficient end rational decision making should occur way
fourth observation favor model permits moral education make difference without making difference
fifth—and think perhaps most important thing favor model—it provides account our important intuition authors our moral decisions
finally model propose points multiplicity decisions encircle our moral decisions suggests many cases our ultimate decision way act less important phenomenologically contributor our sense free will prior decisions affecting our deliberation process itself decision instance consider any further terminate deliberation decision ignore certain lines inquiry
these prior subsidiary decisions contribute think our sense ourselves responsible free agents roughly following way am faced important decision make after certain amount deliberation say myself that's enough
i've considered matter enough now i'm going act full knowledge considered further full knowledge eventualities may prove decided error acceptance responsibility any case
leading libertarian philosophers such robert kane rejected dennett's model specifically random chance directly involved decision basis believe eliminates agent's motives reasons character values feelings desires
claim chance primary cause decisions then agents cannot liable resultant actions
kane says [as dennett admits] causal indeterminist view deliberative kind does give us everything libertarians wanted free will
[the agent] does complete control over chance images other thoughts enter mind influence deliberation
simply come please
[the agent] does control after chance considerations occurred
then there no chance involved
happens then how reacts determined desires beliefs already
appears does control libertarian sense happens after chance considerations occur well
libertarians require full responsibility free will
philosophy mind dennett remarked several places such self-portrait brainchildren overall philosophical project remained largely same since time oxford
primarily concerned providing philosophy mind grounded empirical research
original dissertation content consciousness broke up problem explaining mind need theory content theory consciousness
approach project also stayed true distinction
just content consciousness bipartite structure similarly divided brainstorms two sections
later collect several essays content intentional stance synthesize views consciousness unified theory consciousness explained
these volumes respectively form most extensive development views
chapter 5 consciousness explained dennett describes multiple drafts model consciousness
states varieties perception—indeed varieties thought mental activity—are accomplished brain parallel multitrack processes interpretation elaboration sensory inputs
information entering nervous system under continuous 'editorial revision
later asserts these yield over course time something rather like narrative stream sequence thought subject continual editing many processes distributed around brain
135 emphasis original
work dennett's interest ability evolution explain content-producing features consciousness already apparent since become integral part program
defends theory known neural darwinism
also presents argument against qualia argues concept confused cannot put any use understood any non-contradictory way therefore does constitute valid refutation physicalism
strategy mirrors teacher ryle's approach redefining first person phenomena third person terms denying coherence concepts approach struggles
dennett self-identifies few terms [others] note my 'avoidance standard philosophical terminology discussing such matters' often creates problems me philosophers hard time figuring out am saying am denying
my refusal play ball my colleagues deliberate course since view standard philosophical terminology worse useless—a major obstacle progress since consists many errors
consciousness explained affirms am sort 'teleofunctionalist' course perhaps original teleofunctionalist'
goes say am ready come out closet sort verificationist
evolutionary debate much dennett's work since 1990 s concerned fleshing out previous ideas addressing same topics evolutionary standpoint distinguishes human minds animal minds kinds minds how free will compatible naturalist view world freedom evolves
dennett sees evolution natural selection algorithmic process though spells out algorithms simple long division often incorporate significant degree randomness
idea conflict evolutionary philosophy paleontologist stephen jay gould preferred stress pluralism evolution
dependence many crucial factors natural selection
dennett's views evolution identified being strongly adaptationist line theory intentional stance evolutionary views biologist richard dawkins
darwin's dangerous idea dennett showed himself even willing dawkins defend adaptationism print devoting entire chapter criticism ideas gould
stems gould's long-running public debate e
wilson other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology descendant evolutionary psychology gould richard lewontin opposed dennett advocated together dawkins steven pinker
strong disagreements launched against dennett gould supporters allege dennett overstated claims misrepresented gould's reinforce gould describes dennett's darwinian fundamentalism
dennett's theories significant influence work evolutionary psychologist geoffrey miller
account religion morality darwin's dangerous idea dennett writes evolution account origin morality
rejects idea naturalistic fallacy idea ethics free-floating realm writing fallacy rush facts values
2006 book breaking spell religion natural phenomenon dennett attempts account religious belief naturalistically explaining possible evolutionary reasons phenomenon religious adherence
book declares himself bright defends term
doing research clerics secretly atheists how rationalize their works
found called don't ask don't tell conspiracy because believers want hear loss faith
made unbelieving preachers feel isolated want lose their jobs sometimes their church-supplied lodgings generally consoled themselves doing good their pastoral roles providing comfort required ritual
research linda scola further extended include other denominations non-christian clerics
other philosophical views also written advocated notion memetics philosophically useful tool most recently brains computers minds three-part presentation through harvard's mbb 2009 distinguished lecture series
dennett critical postmodernism having postmodernism school 'thought' proclaimed 'there no truths interpretations' largely played itself out absurdity left behind generation academics humanities disabled their distrust very idea truth their disrespect evidence settling 'conversations' nobody wrong nothing confirmed asserted whatever style you muster
dennett adopted somewhat redefined term deepity originally coined miriam weizenbaum daughter computer scientist joseph weizenbaum
dennett used deepity statement apparently profound actually trivial level meaningless another
generally deepity two meanings true trivial another sounds profound important true actually false meaningless
examples que sera sera! beauty skin deep! power intention transform your life
term cited many times
