hymes' career divided least two phases
early career hymes adapted prague school functionalism american linguistic anthropology pioneering study relationship language social context
together john gumperz erving goffman william labov hymes defined broad multidisciplinary concern language society
hymes' later work focuses poetics particularly poetic organization native american oral narratives
dennis tedlock defined ethnopoetics field study within linguistic anthropology folkloristics
hymes considers literary critic kenneth burke biggest influence latter work saying “my sense probably owes kb anyone else”
hymes studied burke 1950 s
burke's work theoretically topically diverse idea seems most influential hymes application rhetorical criticism poetry
hymes included many other literary figures critics among influences including robert alter c
kroeber claude lévi-strauss
significance work first sociolinguists hymes helped pioneer connection speech social relations placing linguistic anthropology center performative turn within anthropology social sciences generally
hymes formulated response noam chomsky's influential distinction competence knowledge grammatical rules necessary decoding producing language performance actual language use context
hymes objected marginalization performance center linguistic inquiry proposed notion communicative competence knowledge necessary use language social context object linguistic inquiry
since appropriate language use conventionally defined varies across different communities much hymes early work frames project ethnographic investigation contrasting patterns language use across speech communities
hymes termed approach ethnography speaking
speaking acronym described below presented lighthearted heuristic aid fieldworkers their attempt document analyze instances language use termed speech events
embedded acronym application extension jakobson's arguments concerning multifunctionality language
articulated other technical often typologically oriented approaches variation patterns language use across speech communities series articles
result discussions primarily ray birdwhistell university pennsylvania later work hymes renamed ethnography speaking ethnography communication reflect broadening focus instances language production ways communication including oral written broadcast acts receiving/listening conventionalized given community users include nonverbal well verbal behavior
hymes promoted others call “ethnopoetics” anthropological method transcribing analyzing folklore oral narrative pays attention poetic structures within speech
reading transcriptions indian myths example generally recorded prose anthropologists came before hymes noticed there commonly poetic structures wording structuring tale
patterns words word use follow patterned artistic forms
hymes’ goal own mind understand artistry “the competence… underlies informs such narratives” hymes 2003 vii
created dell hymes model speaking coined term communicative competence within language education
addition being entertaining stories important myths nature world narratives also convey importance aboriginal environmental management knowledge such fish spawning cycles local rivers disappearance grizzly bears oregon
hymes believes narratives world organized around implicit principles form convey important knowledge ways thinking viewing world
argues understanding narratives will lead fuller understanding language itself those fields informed storytelling includes ethnopoetics sociolinguistics psycholinguistics rhetoric semiotics pragmatics narrative inquiry literary criticism
hymes clearly considers folklore narrative vital part fields linguistics anthropology literature bemoaned fact few scholars those fields willing able adequately include folklore original language their considerations hymes 19816-7
feels translated versions stories inadequate understanding their role social mental system existed
provides example navajo particles utterances such uh well etc
linguistic semantic meaning omitted english translation essential understanding how story shaped how repetition defines structure text embodies
hymes founding editor journal language society edited years
s-p-e-a-k-i-n-g model main article speaking hymes developed valuable model assist identification labeling components linguistic interaction driven view order speak language correctly needs learn vocabulary grammar also context words used
model sixteen components applied many sorts discourse message form message content setting scene speaker/sender addressor hearer/receiver/audience addressee purposes outcomes purposes goals key channels forms speech norms interaction norms interpretation genres
hymes constructed acronym speaking under grouped sixteen components within eight divisions setting scene setting refers time place speech act general physical circumstances
living room grandparents' home might setting family story
scene psychological setting cultural definition setting including characteristics such range formality sense play seriousness
family story may reunion celebrating grandparents' anniversary
times family festive playful other times serious commemorative
participants speaker audience
linguists will make distinctions within these categories example audience distinguished addressees other hearers
family reunion aunt might tell story young female relatives males although addressed might also hear narrative
ends purposes goals outcomes
aunt may tell story grandmother entertain audience teach young women honor grandmother
act sequence form order event
aunt's story might begin response toast grandmother
story's plot development sequence structured aunt
possibly there collaborative interruption during telling
finally group might applaud tale move onto another subject activity
key clues establish tone manner spirit speech act
aunt might imitate grandmother's voice gestures playful way she might address group serious voice emphasizing sincerity respect praise story expresses
instrumentalities forms styles speech
aunt might speak casual register many dialect features might use formal register careful grammatically standard forms
norms social rules governing event participants' actions reaction
playful story aunt norms might allow many audience interruptions collaboration possibly those interruptions might limited participation older females
serious formal story aunt might call attention her no interruptions norms
genre kind speech act event example used here kind story
aunt might tell character anecdote grandmother entertainment exemplum moral instruction
different disciplines develop terms kinds speech acts speech communities sometimes their own terms types
personal life credible accusations made harassment female students dell hymes though no formal action taken these claims made posthumously[citation needed]
