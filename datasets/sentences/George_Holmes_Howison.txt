important title essay howison deny evolutionary theory properly explains certain kinds developments biological life
rather registered objection those attempt make idea evolution explain things either beyond genuine reach way neglected demands/limits idealistic reason herbert spencer even charles darwin himself eventually extending idea materialistic evolution social moral development
howison stakes out position many still hold proper scientific limits evolutionary theory although howison rarely credited having explained early clearly
howison argues there certain breaks evolution cannot cross without recourse noumenal realm pure reason
evolution idea demands experience self-active ideal persons structures experience itself strictly necessary following proof noumenal based ideality

howison’s section entitled “the city god true god head” spans pages 79–132
howison characterized royce’s conception “absolute” merely reflective royce’s own philosophically unfulfilled conception self-unity falling short necessity sufficiency genuinely inter-personal morality ’conscience’
