however there no evidence any contemporary scholars influenced
strong influence ibn taymiyyah founder hanbali school islamic jurisprudence ahmad ibn hanbal
ibn taymiyyah trained school studied ibn hanbal's musnad great detail having studied over multiple times
though spent much life following school end renounced taqlid blind following
work most influenced sayings actions salaf first 3 generation muslims showed work give preference salaf over contemporaries
modern salafi movement derives name school thought
views god's attributes ibn taymiyyah god should described described himself qur'an way prophet muhammad described god hadith
rejected ta'tili's denied these attributes those compare god creation tashbih those engage esoteric interpretations ta'wil qur'an use symbolic exegesis
ibn taymiyyah those attributes know two above mentioned sources should ascribed god
anything regarding god's attributes people no knowledge should approached manner according ibn taymiyyah mystery unknown left god called tafwid muslim's submit themselves word god prophet called taslim
henri laoust says through framework doctrine provides authority widest possible scope personal internationalization religion
1299 ibn taymiyyah book al-aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra dealt among other topics theology creed
accused anthropomorphism private meeting held scholars house al-din `umar al-kazwini shafii judge
after careful study book cleared those charges
ibn taymiyyah also another book dealing attributes god called al-aqidah al-waasitiyyah
faced considerable hostility towards these views ash'ari's whome most notable taqi al-din al-subki son taj al-din al-subki influential islamic jurists also chief judge damascus their respective times
ibn taymiyyah's highly intellectual discourse explaining wise purpose god human agency problems evil & justice using god's attributes means illustrated dr
jon hoover work ibn taymiyyah's theodicy perpetual optimism
division tawhid ibn taymiyyah supported academic division tawhid three classifications rububiyyah allah lord existence disposer affairs uluhiyyah singling out oneness allah worship asmaa wa sifaat affirmation names attributes allah
works discuss pagans time revelation accepting allah's rububiyyah rejecting uluhiyyah whereby continued worship idols
sources shari'a four fundamental sources sharia accepted thirteenth century sunni jurists — qur'an sunnah consensus jurists ijma qiyas analogical reasoning — ibn taymiyyah opposed use consensus jurists replacing consensus companions sahaba
like islamic jurists ibn taymiyyah believed hierarchy sources sharia
most important quran sunnah any other source abrogate verse qur'an
abrogation verse known arabic naskh possible through another verse qur'an
next sunnah other sources besides quran must contradict
consensus ijma concerning consensus ijma believed consensus any muslims other companions muhammad realistically verifiable speculative thus legitimate source islamic law except certain circumstances
consensus ijma used must companions found their reported sayings actions
according supporter serajul haque rejection consensus other scholars justified basis instructions given jurist shuraih ibn al-hârith caliph umar companions muhammad make decisions first referring qur'an possible then sayings prophet finally refer agreement companions like himself
example ibn taymiyyah use interpretation defense temporary closing christian churches 1299 mamluk sultanate egypt
closing violation 600-year-old covenant christian dhimmi known pact umar
ibn taymiyyah pointed out while venerable pact written 60 years after time companions no legal effect
analogy qiyas ibn taymiyyah considered use analogy qiyas based literal meaning scripture valid source deriving legal rulings
analogy primary instrument legal rationalism islam
acknowledged use four fundamental principles islamic jurisprudence
ibn taymiyyah argued against certainty syllogistic arguments favour analogy qiyas
argues concepts founded induction themselves certain probable thus syllogism based such concepts no certain argument based analogy
further claimed induction itself depends process analogy
model analogical reasoning based juridical arguments
work john f
sowa example used ibn taymiyyah's model analogy
attached caveats however use analogy because considered use reason secondary use revelation
ibn taymiyyah's view analogy should used under framework revelation supporting source
there jurists thought rulings derived through analogy contradict ruling derived qur'an authentic hadith
however ibn taymiyyah disagreed because thought contradiction definitive canonical texts islam definitive reason impossible also understanding salaf
racha el-omari says epistemological level ibn taymiyyah considered salaf better any other later scholars understanding agreement revelation reason
example use analogy islamic legal principle maslaha public good ibn taymiyya believed there any contradiction revelation then due misunderstanding misapplication concept utility
assess utility something criteria benefit harm should come qur'an sunnah criteria also applied establishment correct analogy
example ibn taymiyyah's use analogy fatwa forbidding use hashish grounds analogous wine users should given 80 lashes punishment
anyone disagreed apostate added whose corpse ought washed given decent burial
reason `aql issues surrounding use reason 'aql rational came relation attributes god faced much resistance
time islamic scholars thought attributes god stated qur'an contradictory reason sought other explanations instead
ibn taymiyyah believed reasons itself validated entire qur'an being reliable light argued part scripture rejected then render use reason unacceptable avenue through seek knowledge
thought most perfect rational method use reason contained within qur'an sunnah theologians time used rational reason flawed manner
criticism grammarians ibn taymiyyah mastered grammar arabic books studied book arabic grammar called al-kitab sibawayh
later life met qur'an commentator abu hayyan al-gharnati whom expressed sibawayh prophet syntax nor infallible
committed eighty mistakes book intelligible you
ibn taymiyyah thought severely criticized sibawayh actual substance those criticisms known because book ibn taymiyyah al-bahr within criticisms lost
stated there explanation ayah qur'an hadith prophet himself use philology grammatical explanation becomes obsolete
also should refer understanding salaf first three generations muslims interpreting word within scriptural sources
however discount contributions grammarians completely
ibn taymiyyah stated arabic nouns within scriptural sources divided fuqaha islamic jurists three categories those defined shari'a those defined philology lugha finally those defined social custom `urf
each these categories nouns used their own appropriate manner
madh'hab ibn taymiyyah censured scholars blindly conforming precedence early jurists without any resort qur'an sunnah
contended although juridical precedence place blindly giving authority without contextualization sensitivity societal changes evaluative mindset light qur'an sunnah lead ignorance stagnancy islamic law
ibn taymiyyah likened extremism taqlid blind conformity juridical precedence school thought practice jews christians took their rabbis ecclesiastics gods besides god
arguing against taqlid salaf order better understand live according commands god make ijtihad using scriptural sources
same approach view needed modern times
ibn taymiyyah believed best role models islamic life first three generations islam salaf constitute muhammad's companions referred arabic sahaba first generation followed generation muslims born after death muhammad known tabi'un second generation then followed lastly next generation after tabi'un known tabi' al-tabi'in third generation
ibn taymiyyah gave precedence ideas sahaba early generations over founders islamic schools jurisprudence
ibn taymiyyah qur'an sayings practices muhammad ideas early generations muslims constituted best understanding islam
any deviation their practice viewed bid‘ah innovation forbidden
also praised commentary speeches abdul-qadir gilani
criticized views actions rafaiyah
islamic law polity ibn taymiyya believed islamic policy management based quran 458 goal al-siyasa politics political should protect al-din religion manage al-dunya worldly life affairs
religion state should inextricably linked view state indispensable providing justice people enforcing islamic law enjoining good forbidding evil unifying people preparing society conducive worship god
believed enjoining good forbidding wrong duty every state functionary charge over other muslims caliph schoolmaster charge assessing children's handwriting exercises
ibn taymiyyah supported giving broad powers state
al-siyasa al-shar`iyah focused duties individuals punishments rather rules procedural limits authorities
suspected highway robbers reveal their accomplices location their loot example should held detention lashed indefinite periods
also allowed lashing imprisoned debtors trials suspicion da`sawi al-tuham defendants convicted without witnesses documentary proof
henri laoust ibn taymiyyah never propagated idea single caliphate believed muslim ummah community form confederation states
laoust further stated ibn taymiyyah called obedience god islamic prophet muhammad put limit number leaders muslim community
however mona hassan her recent study political thoughts ibn taymiyyah questions says laoust wrongly claimed ibn taymiyyah thought caliphate redundant idea
hassan shown ibn taymiyyah considered caliphate under rashidun caliphs abu bakr umar uthman ali moral legal ideal
caliphate view ceded favour secular kingship mulk
jihad ibn taymiyyah noted emphasis put importance jihad careful lengthy attention gave questions martyrdom jihad such benefits blessings martyrs afterlife
asserted martyrdom eternal rewards blessings

abandoning means losing entirely partially both kinds happiness
defined jihad comprehends sorts worship whether inward outward including love allah being sincere relying relinquishing one’s soul property sake being patient austere keeping remembrance almighty allah
includes done physical power done heart done tongue through calling way allah means authoritative proofs providing opinions done through management industry wealth

declared allowed fight people observing unambiguous generally recognized obligations prohibitions until undertake perform explicitly prescribed prayers pay zakat fast during month ramadan make pilgrimage mecca avoid prohibited such marrying women spite legal impediments eating impure things acting unlawfully against lives properties muslims like
obligatory take initiative fighting those people soon prophet's summons reasons fought reached them
first attack muslims then fighting them even urgent mentioned dealing fighting against rebellious aggressive bandits
modern context rulings used islamist groups declare jihad against various governments
innovation bid`ah main article bid‘ah even though ibn taymiyyah called theologian totally rejected `ilm al-kalam known islamic theology well aspects sufism peripatetic philosophy innovation bid‘ah
ibn taymiyyah opposed giving any undue religious honors mosques even jerusalem al-aqsa mosque approach rival any way islamic sanctity two most holy mosques within islam masjid al-haram mecca al-masjid al-nabawi madina
practice making journey sole purpose visiting mosque ibn taymiyyah books majmu'at al-rasail al-kubra minhaj al-sunna majmu'at fatawa journey must made except three mosques masjid al-haram masjid al-nabawi masjid al-aqsa
regarding serajul haque says opinion ibn taymiyyah these three mosques accepted prophet object journeys account their excellence over other mosques places prayer
ibn taymiyyah uses saying hadith islamic prophet muhammad bukhari muslim justify view permitted journey exclusively any mosque mecca medina jerusalem
ruler sabuktegin praised ibn taymiyyah censuring groups considered heretical
ibn taymiyyah stated sabuktegin commanded ahlul bidah publicly cursed minbars result jahmiyyah rafida hululiyah mu'tazilah qadariyah publicly cursed along asharites
pilgrimage tombs intercession ibn taymiyyah considered veneration making pilgrimage tomb saints ziyārat al-qubūr innovation
ibn taymiyyah make pilgrimage journey tomb sufi wali prophets comparable worshipping something besides god shirk
make pilgrimage muhammad's grave sole purpose seeking intercession aassistance deemed ibn taymiyyah impermissable
god should asked help god give assistance
uses passages qur'an support view uses hadith prophet advised companion ibn abbas person requires anything should ask god
ibn taymiyyah seeking assistance god through intercession allowed long other person still alive
evidence uses another hadith people due lack rain asked muhammad pray god provide rain agreed rain fall after prophet died similar circumstance arose people go grave
ibn taymiyyah regarding those ask assistance sufi wali says those kuffar infidels
those ask assistance grave prophet sheikh called them mushrik someone engaged shirk
howerver ibn taymiyyah completely against visitation tombs provided go pray dead person seek benefit god alone
mutakallimun section requires expansion ibn taymiyya times 9780195478341
february 2015 mutakallimun scholars engage ilm al-kalam rationalst theology criticised ibn taymiyyah their use rationalist theology philosophy
method kalam used mu`tazilites jahmites ash`ari's
ibn taymiyyah considered use philosophical proofs kalam redundant because saw qur'an sunna superior rational proofs
ibn taymiyyah these explanations grounded scriptural evidence such philosophical explanation divine attributes god proof god using cosmological argument
call islam made using such methods qur'an prophet these theories caused errors corruption
mutakallimun called their use rationalst theology usul al-din principles religion ibn taymiyyah use rationalist theology nothing true usul al-din comes god state otherwise say prophet neglected important aspect islam
ibn taymiyyah says usul al-din mutakallimun deserve named usul din al-shaytan principles satanic religion
ibn taymiyyah's attempts focus attention onto qur'anic rationality taken up student ibn qayyim exception other followers
focus traditionlist rationlism also taken up musa bigiev
sufism ibn taymiyyah rejected two views associated sufism
sufis insulted god their monism doctrine seemingly similar pantheism god encompasses things
rejection included denouncing views monist ibn arabi
second view spiritual enlightenment greater importance obeying sharia failure properly follow example muhammad
ibn arabi sufism general henri laoust says ibn taymiyyah mentions allowed himself deluded youth futuhat ibn al-arabi before discovering how subtly heretical
never condemned ṣūfism itself considered case too many ṣūfis inadmissible deviations doctrine ritual morals such monism antinomianism esotericism
ibn taymiyyah's own writing book majmu fatawa shows completely discount sufism right attitude towards sufism any other thing accept agreement qur'an sunna reject does agree
write positively sufis such abdul-qadir gilani
shi'a islam main article minhaj as-sunnah an-nabawiyyah section requires expansion ibn taymiyya times 9780195478341
february 2015 ibn taymiyyah's severe critique twelver shi'as book minhaj as-sunnah an-nabawiyyah written response book minhaj al-karama fi ma'rifat al-imama shi'a theologian al-`allama al-hilli
focused criticisms similarity shi'as christians jews
regarding shia mourning husayn ashura ibn taymiyyah considered husayn's martyrdom divinely bestowed honour — major tragedy
also argued such mourning never instructed muhammad islamic response recent let alone ancient loss extravagant mourning endure loss patience trust god
however also believed those celebrated ashura anti-shia zealots al-nawasib ignorant people
christianity main article al-jawāb al-ṣaḥīḥ li-man baddala dīn al-masīh section requires expansion ibn taymiyya times 9780195478341
february 2015 polemics against christians
non-muslims ibn taymiyyah witnessed conversions islam growing trend among many mongols
ibn taymiyyah strongly opposed borrowing christianity other non-muslim religions
text necessity straight path kitab iqtida al-sirat al-mustaqim preached beginning muslim life point perfect dissimilarity non-muslims achieved
end opposed celebration observance birthday islamic prophet muhammad construction mosques around tombs sufi saints saying many them muslims even know christian origins these practices
economic views elaborated circumstantial analysis market mechanism theoretical insight unusual time
regarding power supply demand ibn taymiyyah desire goods increases while availability decreases price rises
other hand availability good increases desire decreases price comes down
discourses welfare advantages disadvantages market regulation deregulation almost contemporary ring them
assessment salafism ibn taymiyyah thought main influence behind emergence salafism
placed emphasis understanding islam understood salaf first three generations muslims
modern islamism various concepts within modern islamism attributed ibn taymiyyah
influence noted yahya mochet says ibn taymiyyah thus become sort forefather al-qaeda
reason categorising world distinct territories domain islam dar al-islam rule islam sharia law enforced domain unbelief dar-al-kufr ruled unbelievers domain war dar al-harb territory under rule unbelievers involved active potential conflict domain islam
ibn taymiyyah included fourth
mongols whom considered unbelievers took control city mardin population included many muslims
believing mardin neither domain islam islam legally applied armed forces consisting muslims nor domain war because inhabitants muslim ibn taymiyyah created new composite category known dar al-`ahd
second concept making declaration apostasy takfir against muslim does obey islam
same time ibn taymiyyah maintained no question anothers faith curse them based one's own desire because faith defined god prophet
rather cursing condemning them approach should taken educated religion
further concept attributed ibn taymiyyah duty oppose kill muslim rulers implement revealed law shari'a
ibn taymiyyah's role islamist movements twentieth twenty first century also noted previous coordinator counterterrosims united states department state daniel benjamin labels chapter history modern islamic movements book age sacred terror ibn taymiyya children
yossef rapoport reader islamic history queen mary however says probable narrative
mardin fatwa mardin conference ibn taymiyyah's most famous fatwas regarding mongols conquered destroyed abbasid caliphate 1258 then converted islam
once control mardin behaved unjustly their subjects people mardin asked ibn taymiyyah legal verdict regarding classification territory under live
categorized territory dar al-`ahd ways similar dar al-kufr domain unbelievers
included verdict declaring mongol ruler ghazan other mongols accept shari'a full unbelievers
according nettler kéchichian ibn taymiyyah affirmed jihad against mongols permissible obligatory because latter ruled according sharīʿah through their traditional therefore manmade yassa code
essentially meant mongols living state jāhilīyah ignorance
authors further state two famous student ibn qayyim ibn kathir agreed ruling
called defensive jihad mobilise people kill mongol rulers any supported them muslim non-muslim
ibn taymiyyah talking those support mongols everyone them mongols state over rule regarded belonging most evil class men
either atheist zindīq hypocrite does believe essence religion islam
means outwardly pretends muslim belongs worst class people people bida` heretical innovations
yahya mochet says ibn taymiyyah's call war simply cause rebellion against political power place repel external enemy
2010 group islamic scholars mardin conference argued ibn taymiyyah's famous fatwa residents mardin under control mongols misprinted order fight people living under their territory whereas actual statement muslims living therein should treated according their rights muslims while non-muslims living there outside authority islamic law should treated according their rights
based their understanding original manuscript al-zahiriyah library transmission ibn taymiyyah's student ibn muflih
particapents mardin conference also rejected categorization world different domains war peace stating division result circumstances time
participants further stated division become irrelevant existence nation states

oliver leaman says ibn taymiyyah produced 700 works field islamic sciences
scholarly output described immense wide scope contents bear marks brilliant insights hastility jotted down
case however works yet fully understood efforts being made least western languages gain adequate understanding writings
