philosophical influences development trained phenomenology well classical islamic philosophy profoundly affected philosophies suhrawardi mulla sadra encouraged philosophy martin heidegger khatami developed distinctive approach rejects subjectivism relativism abjures any simple notion interpretive method focuses study nature being
work concentrated development khatami terms ontetic philosophy encompassing cognitive conative aspects being
khatami's main concern humanity human being
works provide specific interpretation humanity self consciousness understanding idea subjectivity
khatami argues efficiency action primordial constituent human being
philosophy provides account proper ground human subjectivity while rejecting modern subjectivism
rejection modern concerns insistence limit modern understanding
also worked intensively morality religion well theory application art
khatami's thinking began remained connected persian thought
persian character khatami's approach evident merely central theoretical role gives concept philosophy thinking also own personal commitment intellectual engagement exchange
indeed few philosophers whom persian become significant category supply positive output modern philosophy
early engagement tradition determined much character direction thinking
ontetic philosophy coined khatami himself term ontetic does merely mean ontological existential western sense addition these term also means fuzzy hierarchic
indicates order being purity
consequently ontetic philosophy intellectual articulation human approach toward complete grasp order being
ontetic terminology refers old understanding persian conception light simultaneously indicates beingconsciousnesslife action
conception constituted graded logic called hiss terminology logic tashkik
way conception logic fundamental human being relations
being contemplated philosophy expressed man himself therefore man's relations world also become central sphere philosophy
man acting subject free agent capable choosing various ends compatible circumstances life insofar responsible those relations other hand end appointed nature obligatory upon moral end
philosophical knowledge world then must entail philosophical knowledge thorough explanation reasons man's duties flowing relation things
furthermore man power reflecting own knowledge seen fact understanding knowledge distinct knowledge study logical structure science distinct knowledge acquires real things
hence arrive comprehensive definition philosophy full understanding order being shadow man's situation moral duties responsibilities resulting knowledge reality
khatami's concept philosophy requires man central philosophical discussion faithful requirement
however enters philosophy scene modernity door
influenced heidegger khatami radically understands modernity subjectivistic process very specific concept man developed
writes heidegger questioned subjectivistic foundation modern concept man world called original thinking determine how man
khatami tries respond quest
dealing heidegger's answer disregarding khatami suggests otherwise notion man subjectivity stepping back toward persian illuminative thought within tries glimpse hint human subject source world even created respect nothing without god yet eternal absolute prior world master world things manifested light
khatami's reference perspective provides interesting frame spur look patterns other accounts material treated modern time likely miss
matter khatami offers hermeneutic reading conception man persian illuminative philosophy
khatami innovatively inquires potential philosophical possibilities virtue philosophy assist current debates attempt overcome influences modern subjectivism conception man self subjectivity
reach goal khatami reconstructed method tacitly employed mulla sadra doctrine illuminative existentialism
reconstruction happens khatami light persian illuminative philosophy hermeneutic assessment phenomenology
khatami's chief aim reconstruction present transcendent notion fuzzy reduction crucial discussion ontetic model
herein hermeneutic reading sadra’s philosophy set within broader consideration course development theories subjectivity manifested works descartes hume kant husserl
context reaches conclusion modern conception subjectivity no corresponding field experience empirically based qualities does amount being vacuous concept
against khatami shows how able overcome conception name ontetic subjectivity gained stepping back persian traditional philosophy
there two crucial elements khatami's appropriation persian philosophy first focus cognition connection cognition being second focus being itself event prior partial disclosure already involved never made completely transparent
both these elements connected khatami's response subjectivist element modern thought
turning back direct experience concept being prior partial disclosure khatami able develop alternative subjectivism also connected ideas taken suhravardi mulla sadra hermeneutical ontology heidegger
just human being taken central determining experience being cognition similarly determined matter recognized experience being reveals spite precisely because way also conceals cognition possible spite precisely because prior involvement
khatami's theory concept presence important role here
khatami takes presence basic clue being emphasizing way presence something own order structure man given over
presence obvious affinities other concepts issue ontetic philosophy
indeed take providing slightly different elaboration essentially same basic conception mind takes our finitude our prior involvement partiality barrier human being rather enabling condition
conception worked out detail sadraean meditations
might react khatami's emphasis our ontetic presence involvement such involvement cannot remain subjectivistic simply grounds determined experience things certain ways rather others
such objection seen simple reiteration basic tendency towards subjectivism khatami rejects khatami also takes issue directly view negative connotations often associated notion arguing rather closing us off our presence open us up recognized
sadraean meditations sadraean point view khatami redeploys notion our presence worked out particular fashion sadra's asfar
khatami's positive conception presence seen connected number different ideas philosophy
way our presence opens us up matter issue such way our presence capable being revised exhibits character concept role human life
ontetic priority khatami assigns presence also tied khatami's emphasis priority question structure human being
moreover indispensable role presence human being connects directly khatami's rethinking practical life
human being necessarily oriented present concerns interests those present concerns interests allow us enter communication world
presence character man means involved connection encompasses both own self-realization cognition environment
our self-realization cognition occurs against background prior presence
basis khatami thus advances view subjectivity rejects idea subjectivity achieved through modern philosophy indicates gaining access inner realm subjective meaning
subjectivity ongoing process rather something ever completed also rejects idea there any final determinacy human subjectivity
ontetic model subjectivity briefly khatami seeking model subjectivity capable meeting modern requirements convening privileges modern subjectivism say man spiritual nature
regarding goal may organize endeavour three steps first tries reevaluate modern subjectivism ventures amend interpreting legionnaires modernity second tries construe classic persian conception man ontetic absolute subject reformulated modern terms third tries show rhezomatic turn depth modern subjectivism toward neutral spirituality divinity
step rethinking transcendental subjectivity supporting heidegger khatami says modernity philosophically characterized subjectivism whose history began descartes
historically speaking modern sense man formulated later kant's copernican revolution according man become autonomous agent knowledge action
kant's pluralistic approach problem subject object relation led presuppose transcendental characteristic human subjectivity
khatami considers kant's subjectivistic turn analyze characteristic order go beyond formal sense revise either aspects subjectivity
while regards hegel’s early critique kant’s transcendental reflection significant step surpassing formal approach transcendental subjectivity nevertheless continues deformalize transcendental consider latent
latent khatami's view am because am essentially memory full my past plenitude however specified images determines meaning my being present
khatami argues attributing transcendental latent memory seem make empirical
nevertheless khatami retains ontological meaning memory—meaning memory recollection my own history résumé my own experience also very possibility experience transcendental latent
consequently infers transcendental considered activity respect object must say implicitly known relation subject implicit knowledge latent itself
knowledge according formal reality structure subject
structure activity guarantees subject profound being both universal singular promotes intersubjectivity understood communication similar subjects
step two human subjectivity absolute following first step khatami tries reformulate human subject absolute
reconsiders here illuminative tradition persian thought notion man both world less world
former man descending god comprehensive totality macrocosm within through world created while latter ascending god singular individual microcosm shattered fallen down earth still same colour divine essence within
khatami highlights former aspect notion source latter same time sheds light concealed essence human being forgotten modern subjectivism
notion man constitutes essence integration divine inward well outward names
thus illuminative man homocosm divine worldly realities
created god's vicegerent while entire world particularization exists
world thus created through man man even though visible world man appeared last
illuminative man capacity like create uttering command keen exhibiting ability control nature above absolute subject comprehends creation means comprehension comes dominate over world name comprehends
absolute sense god's vicegerent created creator
step three subjectivity technology ontetic model subjectivity offered khatami led very crucial point modern world technology
khatami tries support idea ontetic subject still alive behind technological veil modern world
sum khatami's ontetic model suggests discern shadow ontetic subject today's technological world also figure technological subject already traditional metaphysics
