l'harmonie universelle 1637 book consists mersenne's laws describe frequency oscillation stretched string
frequency inversely proportional length string actually known ancients usually credited pythagoras himself
proportional square root stretching force inversely proportional square root mass per unit length
formula lowest frequency f frequency l length f force μ mass per unit length
book mersenne also introduced several innovative concepts considered basis modern reflecting telescopes much earlier laurent cassegrain found fundamental arrangement two-mirror telescope combination concave primary mirror associated convex secondary mirror discovered telephoto effect critical reflecting telescopes although obvious far having understood implications discovery
mersenne invented afocal telescope beam compressor useful many multiple-mirrors telescope designs
recognized also correct spherical aberration telescope using aspherical mirrors particular case afocal arrangement correction using two parabolic mirrors though hyperboloid required
because criticism encountered especially descartes mersenne made no attempt build telescope own
