entered joachimsthal gymnasium 1860 nearly eleven
1867 after graduating went university göttingen began university studies studied there semester before returning berlin attended lectures kronecker kummer karl weierstrass
received doctorate awarded distinction 1870 supervised weierstrass
thesis supervised weierstrass solution differential equations
1874 after having taught secondary school level first joachimsthal gymnasium then sophienrealschule appointed university berlin extraordinary professor mathematics
frobenius berlin year before went zürich take up appointment ordinary professor eidgenössische polytechnikum
seventeen years 1875 1892 frobenius worked zürich
there married brought up family much important work widely differing areas mathematics
last days december 1891 kronecker died therefore chair berlin became vacant
weierstrass strongly believing frobenius right person keep berlin forefront mathematics used considerable influence frobenius appointed
1893 returned berlin elected prussian academy sciences
contributions group theory group theory frobenius' principal interests second half career
first contributions proof sylow theorems abstract groups
earlier proofs permutation groups
proof first sylow theorem existence sylow groups those frequently used today
frobenius also proved following fundamental theorem positive integer n divides order |g| finite group g then number solutions equation xn = g equal kn positive integer k
also posed following problem above theorem k = then solutions equation xn = g form subgroup
many years ago problem solved solvable groups
after classification finite simple groups problem solved general
important creation theory group characters group representations fundamental tools studying structure groups
work led notion frobenius reciprocity definition now called frobenius groups
group g frobenius group there subgroup h < g such
case set together identity element g forms subgroup nilpotent john g
thompson showed 1959
known proofs theorem make use characters
first paper characters 1896 frobenius constructed character table group order 1/2 p3 − p odd primes p group simple provided p > 3
also made fundamental contributions representation theory symmetric alternating groups
contributions number theory frobenius introduced canonical way turning primes conjugacy classes galois groups over q
specifically k/q finite galois extension then each positive prime p does ramify k each prime ideal p lying over p k there unique element g gal k/q satisfying condition gx = xp mod p integers x k
varying p over p changes g conjugate every conjugate g occurs way conjugacy class g galois group canonically associated p
called frobenius conjugacy class p any element conjugacy class called frobenius element p
take k mth cyclotomic field whose galois group over q units modulo m thus abelian conjugacy classes become elements then p dividing m frobenius class galois group p mod m
point view distribution frobenius conjugacy classes galois groups over q generally galois groups over any number field generalizes dirichlet's classical result primes arithmetic progressions
study galois groups infinite-degree extensions q depends crucially construction frobenius elements provides sense dense subset elements accessible detailed study
