christopher morcom sherborne turing formed significant friendship fellow pupil christopher morcom described turing's first love
their relationship provided inspiration turing's future endeavours cut short morcom's death february 1930 complications bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow's milk years previously
event caused turing great sorrow
coped grief working much harder topics science mathematics shared morcom
letter morcom's mother turing am sure found anywhere another companion brilliant yet charming unconceited
regarded my interest my work such things astronomy introduced me something shared think felt little same me
know must put much energy much interest my work alive because like me
speculated morcom's death cause turing's atheism materialism seems unlikely
apparently point life still believed such concepts spirit independent body surviving death
later letter also written morcom's mother turing personally believe spirit really eternally connected matter certainly same kind body
regards actual connection spirit body consider body [can] hold 'spirit' whilst body alive awake two firmly connected
body asleep cannot guess happens body dies 'mechanism' body holding spirit gone spirit finds new body sooner later perhaps immediately
