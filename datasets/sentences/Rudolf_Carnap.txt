carnap elaborated extended concept logical syntax proposed wittgenstein tractatus section 3
order avoid such errors must make use sign-language excludes them using same sign different symbols using superficially similar way signs different modes signification say sign-language governed logical grammar—by logical syntax

propositions cannot represent logical form mirrored them
finds reflection language language cannot represent
expresses itself language cannot express means language
propositions show logical form reality
