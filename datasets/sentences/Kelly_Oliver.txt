animal lessons 2009 animal lessons oliver analyzes use animal examples throughout history philosophy arguing work thinkers diverse heidegger merleau-ponty derrida agamben freud lacan kristeva animals play key theoretical role defining means human
while philosophers historically interested maintaining strong distinction animal human often basis reason oliver's analyses these major thinkers suggests much philosophical discourse humanity ethics depends upon lessons learned animal behavior
her point however animals humans exactly same instead being human dependent upon particular relation animals thus great chasm western philosophy posits two untenable
while oliver questions viability strict animal/human dichotomy however animal lessons does follow typical trajectory ethical work animal rights
fact oliver critical rights-based ethical discourse simply expand scope include animals since such strategy leave un-questioned assumptions nature humanity rights depend
many cases oliver suggests such assumptions form foundation much ethical theory through concepts such property desert philosophy themselves inextricably connected our thinking animals
thus while animal lessons does approach animal ethics traditional mode oliver argues many our most pressing contemporary ethical questions connected claims animals
atrocities torture genocide example frequently justified comparing their victims animals
oliver puts interview book man-animal binary just any opposition used most often justify violence man’s violence animals also man’s violence other people deemed like animals
until interrogate history opposition exclusionary values considering animals particular animals like us recognizing also species animal does very little change “how eat other” jacques derrida might say
end oliver calls approach both ethics both animal human mindful our constitutive relationship animals she playfully calls 'free range' ethics breaks out self-centered exclusionary domineering notions individuality identity sovereignty
such ethics recognize humans' mutual dependency animals environment other humans thus less concerned traditional problems individual rights obligations living responsibly within relationship dependence
she writes era species extinction shrinking biodiversity military occupation expanded torture record wealth few poverty rest gated-communities record incarceration need sustainable ethics ever
sustainable ethics ethics limits ethics conservation
rather assert our dominion over earth creatures ethics obliges us acknowledge our dependence upon them
requires us attend our response-ability virtue dependence
ethics responsibility enable responses others defined—as exclusive property man man responds animals react—but rather exits around us
living creatures responsive
us belong earth sense property rather inhabitants shared planet
