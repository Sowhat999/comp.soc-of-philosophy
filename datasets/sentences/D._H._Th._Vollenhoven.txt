amsterdam mathematician gerrit mannoury whom vollenhoven critically described being “the most consequential formalist communistic pragmatist” responded sympathetically dissertation saying vollenhoven taken path “that blazed anyone before” “neither theologian nor mathematician cherished faith yet without despising thought
parsonage oostkapelle later hague vollenhoven performed duties conscientiously also continued study philosophy
1920 received scholarship leave absence study psychology under felix krueger five months leipzig
early 1920 s neo-kantianism dominant school netherlands
philosophy vollenhoven sought reconciliation thought being mediated theistically priority given being
mid-1922 radicalized knowing thought part being
neo-kantianism contrariwise took departure thought justified humanistic fashion
other words vollenhoven rowed against main current time
many commitments interests led becoming overworked
mid-january 1923 suffered mental collapse recuperation took up most year
vollenhoven dooyeweerd meantime vollenhoven’s brother-in-law chess mate former study chum herman dooyeweerd became active philosophy
visited vollenhoven oostkapelle discuss how might work way philosophy methodically
both lived hague their discussions became intense searching enduring partnership philosophy developed lasted life-time
yet their personalities very different vollenhoven analytical disposition organizer systematic thinker man detailed historical overviews dooyeweerd musical talent fine pianist jurist training sought grand design
vollenhoven worked way problems mathematics natural sciences biology psychology epistemology theology while dooyeweerd good command sociology economics jurisprudence
end 1923 both advanced “reformed philosophy” referred “calvinistic philosophy” now usually called reformational philosophy
simultaneously appointed university chairs vrije universiteit amsterdam 1926 dooyeweerd juridical faculty vollenhoven faculty arts philosophy successor geesink

time intense contact took place klaas schilder
schilder reformed theologian played dominant role split reformed churches netherlands 1944 development much lamented vollenhoven
new anthropology after illness 1923 vollenhoven began openly criticize dogma immortality soul
first initiated
janse self-taught elementary school principal whom vollenhoven struck up friendship
“the first questions psychology” 1929 published lecture vollenhoven explained soul usually understood immortal substance rather psyche function human being operates within aspect “law-sphere” reality
took soul itself central unity heart human being
vollenhoven no enemies gain first opponents connection among psychologists particular jan waterink defended distinct reality body soul spirit
syllabus introductory course philosophy entitled isagôgè philosophiae 1930 first document summarize new “reformational philosophy
vollenhoven referred “calvinistic philosophy” term first used inaugural address 1926
attracted many led formation distinct school philosophy
vice-chancellor’s oration given during term 1932-1933 vice-chancellor university discussed “the necessity christian logic
vollenhoven criticized so-called “neutrality” logic
latter uses logic mere instrument analysis guided epistemological subject rather viewing logic contributing substantively understanding through principles
shortly afterwards vollenhoven’s book appeared calvinism reformation philosophy 1933 clarified program also elicited criticism h
kuyper v
hepp especially regarding vollenhoven’s opposition scholasticism
response vollenhoven displayed perseverance without becoming polemical “we must seek conflict work constructively
while vollenhoven dooyeweerd worked close cooperation each retained independence
dooyeweerd defended reformational philosophy standpoint transcendental critique
critique sought expose dependence thought particularly theoretical thought religion
vollenhoven keener setting out viable religious presuppositions any understanding reality
unique ontology example ontology vollenhoven opposed notion concept being encompasses god cosmos human being
vollenhoven’s primary distinction trinity law cosmos holds created cosmos entirely sustained god
connection cosmos different fundamental aspects “law-spheres” distinguished—fifteen made explicit—in creatures function
human being outwardly functions “structured throughout” inwardly there direction-determining soul heart “out issues life
law generic sense forms boundary limit created reality involves three-fold specification there creation command “let there …” genesis relevant “the origination structure whereby implicit modal diversity [of law-spheres] internal development each kingdom” ii love command “concerns [moral] direction human life relation god fellow human being” iii positive laws “bridge love command concrete situation” need regulation “in light society’s purpose historical phase geographical location
since “knowing part being” theory knowledge presupposes ontology hence analysis needs proceed created reality respect being law-bound
theology turn dependent revelation rather logically drawn conclusions being god
latter procedure ignores boundary defines our human limitation
history philosophy history philosophy vollenhoven concentrated developing problem-historical method
philosopher finds himself network relations contemporaries predecessors
reflected philosophical position hand how deals current problems time attempts supersede them other hand evidencing preference how specific tradition thought treats problems recur thought
discussion current problems usually conducted terms uniformity style focusing those features taken normative involving view truth law deemed fitting such contemporary discussions
seen greater range time distinct styles contemporary approaches give rise historically distinct periods temporal succession vollenhoven refers “time-currents” philosophy e
hellenism neoplatonism waning middle ages age enlightenment positivism existentialism postmodernism
other hand treatment recurring problems centers ontology influence variety views concerning world cosmos may include world gods such gnosticism concerning anthropology often seen reflecting structure world
vollenhoven finds ontologies predominate cosmology anthropology either monistic dualistic each kind giving rise variety traditional “types ontology” e
priority theory interactionism parallelism platonizing aristotelian hylomorphism
summary any philosopher’s position situated crossing time-current type ontology same time brings together characterizes philosophical conception problems relevant position
overall aim problem-historical method make visible lay-out currents types thereby basic problems thought throughout whole history philosophy hesiod martin heidegger
