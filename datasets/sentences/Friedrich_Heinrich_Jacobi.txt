fourth volume also important preface
thought jacobi's philosophy essentially unsystematic
fundamental view underlies thinking brought bear succession upon those systematic doctrines appear stand most sharply contradiction any positive philosophic results given occasionally
leading idea whole complete separation understanding apprehension real fact
jacobi understanding logical faculty purely formal elaborative results never transcend given material supplied
basis immediate experience perception thought proceeds comparison abstraction establishing connections among facts remaining nature mediate finite
principle reason consequent necessity thinking each given fact perception conditioned impels understanding towards endless series identical propositions records successive comparisons abstractions
province understanding therefore strictly region conditioned world must present itself mechanism
then there objective truth existence real facts must made known us otherwise through logical faculty thought regress conclusion premises must depend upon something itself capable logical grounding mediate thought implies consciousness immediate truth
philosophy therefore must resign hopeless ideal systematic
intelligible explanation things must content itself examination facts consciousness
mere prejudice philosophic thinkers prejudice descended aristotle mediate demonstrated cognition superior cogency value immediate perception truths facts
jacobi starts doctrine thought partial limited applicable connect facts incapable explaining their existence evident any demonstrative system metaphysic should attempt subject existence principle logical ground must repulsive
now modern philosophy first greatest demonstrative system metaphysic spinoza[citation needed] therefore sensible upon spinoza's system jacobi should first direct criticism
summary results examination thus presented werke
216-223 spinozism atheism kabbalistic philosophy insofar philosophy nothing undeveloped confused spinozism philosophy leibniz wolff less fatalistic spinoza carries resolute thinker very principles spinoza every demonstrative method ends fatalism nihilism demonstrate similarities agreements truths conditionally necessary proceeding identical propositions every proof presupposes something already proved principle immediately given offenbarung revelation term here employed jacobi many later writers e
lotze denote peculiar character immediate unproved given truth keystone element human knowledge activity belief glaube faith
these propositions first fourth require further explanation
jacobi accepting law reason consequent fundamental rule demonstrative reasoning rule explicitly followed spinoza points out proceed applying principle recede particular qualified facts general abstract conditions land ourselves notion active intelligent creator system things notion all-comprehensive indeterminate nature devoid will intelligence
our unconditioned either pure abstraction else impossible notion completed system conditions
either case result atheism result necessary demonstrative method method understanding regarded possible means knowledge
moreover same method inevitably lands fatalism/nihilism
action human will made intelligible understanding must thought conditioned phenomenon having sufficient ground preceding circumstances ultimate abstraction outflow nature sum conditions
fatalist conception any philosophy accepts law reason consequent essence understanding fatalistic/nihilistic
thus scientific understanding there no god no liberty
impossible there should god necessity finite
finite god god known no god
impossible there should liberty mechanical order phenomena means comprehensible disturbed should unintelligible world coupled requirement shall understood
cognition then strict sense occupies middle place sense perception belief matters sense reason belief supersensuous fact
