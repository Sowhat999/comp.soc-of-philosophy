much time however spent paris likely during time made acquaintance maupertuis marquise de châtelet
these years during attack fever made observations himself reference action quickened blood circulation upon thought led conclusion mental processes accounted effects organic changes brain nervous system
conclusion worked out earliest philosophical work histoire naturelle de l'âme 1745
great outcry caused publication mettrie forced quit position french guards taking refuge leiden
there developed doctrines still boldly completely l'homme machine hastily written treatise based upon consistently materialistic quasi-atheistic principles
mettrie's materialism many ways product medical concerns drawing work 17 th-century predecessors such epicurean physician guillaume lamy
pierre louis maupertuis also native saint-malo helped mettrie find refuge prussia
ethical implications these principles later worked out discours sur le bonheur mettrie considered magnum opus
here developed theory remorse
view inauspicious effects feelings guilt acquired early age during process enculturation
idea brought enmity virtually thinkers french enlightenment damnatio memoriae lifted century later friedrich albert lange geschichte des materialismus

man animal prior man machine published natural history soul 1745
argued humans just complex animals
great deal controversy emerged due belief animals man there no abrupt transition
later built idea claiming humans animals composed organized matter
believed humans animals different regards complexity matter organized

idea essentially no real difference humans animals existed based findings sensory feelings present animals plants
while recognize humans spoke language thought animals capable learning language
used apes example stating trained perfect [men]
further expressed ideas man very different animals suggesting learn through imitation animals
beliefs humans animals based two types continuity
first being weak continuity suggesting humans animals made same things organized differently
main emphasis however strong continuity idea psychology behavior humans animals different
man machine mettrie believed man worked like machine due mental thoughts depending bodily actions
then argued organization matter high complex level resulted human thought
believe existence god
rather chose argue organization humans done provide best use complex matter possible
mettrie arrived belief after finding bodily mental illnesses associated each other
after gathering enough evidence medical psychological fields published book
evidence mettrie presented disregarded due nature
argued events such beheaded chicken running around recently removed heart animal still working proved connection brain body
while theories build off mettrie's works necessarily scientific
rather writings controversial defiant
human nature further expressed radical beliefs asserting himself determinist dismissing use judges
disagreed christian beliefs emphasized importance going after sensual pleasure hedonistic approach human behavior
further looked human behavior questioning belief humans higher sense morality animals
noted animals rarely tortured each other argued animals capable level morality
believed machines humans follow law nature ignore their own interests those others
