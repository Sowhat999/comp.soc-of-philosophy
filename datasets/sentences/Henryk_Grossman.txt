contribution theory while frankfurt mid-1920 s grossman contended general tendency cling results marx's theory ignorance subtleties method underlying capital causing catastrophic vulgarisation marxian thought trend undermining revolutionary possibilities moment
law accumulation attempt demonstrate marxian political economy underestimated critics extension revolutionary critiques capitalism still valid
amongst other arguments sets forth following demonstration complete definition terms employed whole book recommended logical mathematical basis law breakdown apart arithmetical logical proofs given already mathematicians may prefer following general form presentation avoids purely arbitrary values concrete numerical example
meaning symbols c = constant capital
initial value = co
value after j years = cj v = variable capital
initial value = vo
value after j years = vj s = rate surplus value written percentage v ac = rate accumulation constant capital c av = rate accumulation variable capital v k = consumption share capitalists s = mass surplus value being ω = organic composition capital cv correction respect grossman's text formula below follows grossman means ω initial value organic composition capital j = number years further let let formula after j years assumed rate accumulation ac constant capital c reaches level assumed rate accumulation av variable capital v reaches level year after j + accumulation continued usual according formula whence k greater 0 necessary k = 0 year n note line follows german original das akkumulations- und zusammenbruchsgesetz des kapitalistischen systems zugleich eine krisentheorie because misspecified condensed english translation
timing absolute crisis given point consumption share entrepreneur vanishes completely long after already started decline
means whence n = real number long s > av assume anyway throughout our investigation
starting time-point n mass surplus value s sufficient ensure valorisation c v under conditions postulated
discussion formula number years n down absolute crisis thus depends four conditions level organic composition ω
higher smaller number years
crisis accelerated
rate accumulation constant capital ac works same direction level organic composition capital
rate accumulation variable capital av work either direction sharpening crisis defusing whose impact therefore ambivalent
level rate surplus value s defusing impact greater s greater number years n breakdown tendency postponed
accumulation process continued earlier assumptions modified rate accumulation constant capital ac reduced tempo accumulation slowed down constant capital devalued again reduces rate accumulation ac labour power devalued hence wages cut rate accumulation variable capital av reduced rate surplus value s enhanced finally capital exported again rate accumulation ac reduced
these four major cases allow us deduce variations actually found reality impart capitalist mode production certain elasticity
much remainder grossman's book devoted exploring these elasticities counter-crisis tendencies tracking both their logical their actual historical development
examples each include depressed interest rates investment capital transferred unproductive speculation e
housing stock art objects
enlarged state sector bleeds value accumulation process via taxes
wars destroy capital values
reserve army labour unemployed created discipline wage claims
