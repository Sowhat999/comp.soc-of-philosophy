marcuse's 1965 essay repressive tolerance claimed capitalist democracies totalitarian aspects criticized conservatives
marcuse argues genuine tolerance does permit support repression since doing ensures marginalized voices will remain unheard
characterizes tolerance repressive speech inauthentic
instead advocates form tolerance intolerant right wing political movements liberating tolerance then mean intolerance against movements right toleration movements left
surely no government expected foster own subversion democracy such right vested people
majority people
means ways should blocked subversive majority develop blocked organized repression indoctrination their reopening may require apparently undemocratic means
include withdrawal toleration speech assembly groups movements promote aggressive policies armament chauvinism discrimination grounds race religion oppose extension public services social security medical care etc

herbert marcuse first wife sophie marcuse their new york apartment philosophy views famous concept repressive desublimation refers argument postwar mass culture profusion sexual provocations serves reinforce political repression
people preoccupied unauthentic sexual stimulation their political energy will desublimated instead acting constructively change world remain repressed uncritical
marcuse advanced prewar thinking critical theory toward critical account one-dimensional nature bourgeois life europe america
thinking therefore also considered advance concerns earlier liberal critics like david riesman
two aspects marcuse's work particular importance firstly use language familiar critique soviet nazi regimes characterize developments advanced industrial world secondly grounding critical theory particular use psychoanalytic thought
both these features thinking often misunderstood given rise critiques work miss point targets
marcuse's early heideggerian marxism during years freiburg marcuse series essays explored possibility synthesizing marxism heidegger's fundamental ontology begun latter's work being time 1927
early interest heidegger followed marcuse's demand concrete philosophy declared 1928 concerns itself truth contemporaneous human existence
these words directed against neo-kantianism mainstream against both revisionist orthodox marxist alternatives subjectivity individual played little role
though marcuse quickly distanced himself heidegger following heidegger's endorsement nazism suggested thinkers such jürgen habermas understanding marcuse's later thinking demands appreciation early heideggerian influence
marcuse capitalism marcuse’s analysis capitalism derives partially karl marx’s main concepts objectification under capitalism becomes alienation
marx believed capitalism exploiting humans producing objects laborers became alienated ultimately dehumanized them functional objects
marcuse took belief expanded
argued capitalism industrialization pushed laborers hard began see themselves extensions objects producing
beginning one-dimensional man marcuse writes people recognize themselves their commodities find their soul their automobile hi-fi set split-level home kitchen equipment meaning under capitalism consumer society humans become extensions commodities buy thus making commodities extensions people's minds bodies
affluent mass technological societies argued totally controlled manipulated
societies based upon mass production mass distribution individual worker become merely consumer commodities entire commodity way life
modern capitalism created false needs false consciousness geared consumption commodities locked one-dimensional man one-dimensional society produced need people recognize themselves their commodities find their soul their automobile hi-fi set split-level home kitchen equipment
very mechanism ties individual society changed social control anchored new needs produced
most important pressure consumerism led total integration working class capitalist system
political parties trade unions become thoroughly bureaucratized power negative thinking critical reflection rapidly declined
working class no longer potentially subversive force capable bringing revolutionary change
result rather looking workers revolutionary vanguard marcuse put faith alliance radical intellectuals those groups yet integrated one-dimensional society socially marginalized substratum outcasts outsiders exploited persecuted other race other colours unemployed unemployable
these people whose standards living demanded ending intolerable conditions institutions whose resistance one-dimensional society diverted system
their opposition revolutionary even their consciousness
criticism leszek kołakowski described marcuse's views essentially anti-marxist ignored marx's critique hegel discarded historical theory class struggle entirely favor inverted freudian reading human history social rules should discarded create new world happiness
kołakowski concluded marcuse's ideal society ruled despotically enlightened group [who] realized themselves unity logos eros thrown off vexatious authority logic mathematics empirical sciences
philosopher alasdair mac intyre asserted almost marcuse's key positions false generalizations based upon total absence any account contemporary social structure
featherstone criticized portrayal modern consumerism falsely assumed consumers completely passive uncritically responding corporate advertising
legacy herbert marcuse appealed students new left through emphasis power critical thought vision total human emancipation non-repressive civilization
supported students felt subject pressures commodifying system regarded inspirational intellectual leader
also considered among most influential frankfurt school critical theorists north american culture due studies student counter-cultural movements 1960 s
legacy 1960 s marcuse vital part lives great refusal still practiced oppositional groups individuals refuse conform existing oppression domination
