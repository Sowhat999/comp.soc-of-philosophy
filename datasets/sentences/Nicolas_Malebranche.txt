malebranche’s biographer father yves andré reported malebranche influenced descartes’ book because allowed view natural world without aristotelian scholasticism
malebranche spent next decade studying cartesian system
philosophical career 1674–75 malebranche published two volumes first most extensive philosophical work
entitled concerning search after truth
treated nature human mind use must made avoid error sciences french de recherche de vérité
où l’on traite de nature de l’esprit de l’homme et de l’usage qu’il en doit faire pour éviter l’erreur dans les sciences book laid foundation malebranche’s philosophical reputation ideas
dealt causes human error how avoid such mistakes
most importantly third book discussed pure understanding defended claim ideas through perceive objects exist god
malebranche's first critic abbé simon foucher attacked search even before second volume published
malebranche replied short preface added second volume then 1678 third edition added 50% already considerable size book sequence eventually seventeen elucidations
these responded further criticisms also expanded original arguments developed them new ways
tenth elucidation instance malebranche introduced theory intelligible extension single archetypal idea extension ideas particular kinds bodies jointly resolved
others malebranche placed greater emphasis previously done occasionalist account causation particularly contention god acted most part through general volitions rarely case miracles through particular volitions
malebranche expanded last point 1680 published treatise nature grace
here made explicit generality laws whereby god regulated behaviour extended activity natural world also applied gift grace human beings
book attacked fellow cartesian philosopher antoine arnauld although arnauld's initial concerns theological ones bitter dispute ensued very quickly branched out most other areas their respective systems
over next few years two men enough polemics against other fill four volumes malebranche's collected works three arnauld's
arnauld's supporters managed persuade roman catholic church place nature grace index prohibited books 1690 followed there search nineteen years later
ironically index already contained several works jansenist arnauld himself
other critics whom malebranche entered significant discussion include another fellow cartesian pierre sylvain regis well dortous de mairan
de mairan sympathetic views baruch spinoza felt found similar views reading malebranche malebranche assiduously resisted such association

philosophy vision god just human action along action any other creature entirely dependent god too human cognition
malebranche argued human knowledge dependent divine understanding way analogous motion bodies dependent divine will
like rené descartes malebranche held humans attain knowledge through ideas immaterial representations present mind
whereas descartes believed ideas mental entities malebranche argued ideas exist god
these ideas therefore uncreated independent finite minds
access them intellectually apprehend objective truth
malebranche defined truth relation ideas since these ideas god eternal immutable consequently truths worthy name will themselves eternal immutable
malebranche divided these relations ideas two categories relations magnitude relations quality perfection
former constitute speculative truths such those geometry while latter constitute practical truths ethics
ethical principles malebranche therefore divine their foundation universal their application discovered intellectual contemplation just geometrical principles
regard account intellectual knowledge malebranche less following saint augustine
great innovation explain how these same divine ideas also serve immediate objects human minds sensual perception
problem there divine ideas universal whereas perception seems particulars
malebranche's solution suggest whereas mind's intellectual conception these ideas pure direct sensual perception them will modified sensations
these sensations unlike ideas indeed proper individual created minds subsist modes thereof
idea will represent geometrical mechanical properties bodies size shape motion while sensation will consist colour other sensible quality
latter will limit mind's apprehension former such manner make represent particular individual mind
different mind different sensation same idea represent different individual same general kind
dialogues metaphysics religion dialogue malebranche added same basic structure also account mental opposed physiological element imagination case idea lightly touches mind
critical summary malebranche strongly influenced descartes accept philosophy uncritically
noted particularly view see things god adoption psycho-physical parallelism 'occasionalism' deal problem interaction mind body
however attribution epistemological explanatory primacy god leads difficulties
see things god sense puts ideas our minds no direct knowledge external world
appeal clear distinct ideas criterion veridicality judgements physical things god ultimately responsible our ideas
2 things under direct control god — subject will human freedom? malebranche's view freedom choose relation finite goods convincing denying does possibility resistance movement towards god universal good
3 far god identified archetypal eternal truths mind malebranche pantheist
mediaeval philosophy gives rise problem reconciling god's freedom supposed immutability
4 god central malebranche's philosophy
however 'vision' things god needs supported rational proof
unfortunately offers cartesian version ontological argument open standard objection entity's actuality cannot derived mere abstract concept
theodicy malebranche's theodicy solution problem evil
although conceded god power create perfect world free defects such world necessitated greater complexity divine ways
thus god produces natural evils follow simple laws because wills those particular effects because wills world best reflects wisdom achieving best possible balance intrinsic perfection work simplicity generality laws
malebranche's dualism whereas malebranche followed augustine description intellectual knowledge approach mind-body problems began follower descartes
contrast descartes considered possible form clear distinct idea mind malebranche argues dialogues metaphysics dialogue theodore aristes complete conception powers mind thus no clear conception nature mind
am unable turn myself recognize any my faculties my capacities
inner sensation myself informs me am think will sensory awareness suffer provides me no knowledge whatever am - nature my thought my sensations my passions my pain - mutual relations obtain these things [
no idea whatever my soul
leads theodore declare 'i am my own light myself' nature our own minds highly obscure
regard psycho-physical interaction malebranche argues body act mind nor mind body
active power hence efficient cause change world god
will my arm should rise my volition occasion occasional cause movement my arm efficient cause both my volition movement my arm god
malebranche's doctrine found contemporary commentaries aristotle first appeared certain arab philosophers therefore called occasionalism
occasionalism general occasionalism view there no efficient causes full sense other god
created things best occasions divine activity
bodies minds act neither themselves nor each other god alone brings phenomena nature mind
changes occurring created things will exhibit regularities will thus satisfy humean definition causation because god creating world observes malebranche calls order binds himself act according laws nature chosen accordance general will world good possible thus example laws simple few number
particular there will laws governing customarily call interaction body mind similar movements body will occasion similar ideas mind
relation features causal relation satisfies example universal conditionals form whenever c occurs e occurs
reality both idea mind movement body caused god
scientific contributions although better known philosophical work malebranche made notable contributions physics working within broadly cartesian framework nevertheless prepared depart descartes necessary
1699 delivered address académie royale des sciences nature light color wherein argued different colors resulted out different frequencies pressure vibrations subtle matter much different musical tones derived different frequencies vibrations air
theory presented corrective descartes' view rather refutation thereof important parallels rival optical theory isaac newton
newton already developed position thirty years earlier malebranche probably aware until finally published opticks 1704 likely latin translation 1706
malebranche revised 1699 paper inclusion sixteenth elucidation 1712 edition search after truth inserted number references newton's excellent work
addition malebranche laws motion topic discussed extensively leibniz
also mathematics although made no major mathematical discoveries own instrumental introducing disseminating contributions descartes leibniz france
malebranche introduced l'hôpital johann bernoulli ultimate result being publication first textbook infinitesimal calculus
malebranche also developed original theory related preformationism postulating each embryo probably contained even smaller embryos ad infinitum like matryoshka doll
according malebranche infinite series plants animals contained within seed egg naturalists sufficient skill experience detect their presence
magner 158–9 legacy aside perhaps john norris any case drew least much malebranche's own sources primarily saint augustine malebranche himself there few any philosophers considered faithful followers malebranche matters
however held widespread high regard within own lifetime time afterwards influence certain ideas discerned works several important figures
pierre bayle regarded malebranche greatest philosophers age though admittedly greatest often reported
note h zeno elea article bayle discussed malebranche's views material substance particular approval
occasionalism vision god seem make real existence material substance redundant
unable directly perceived cannot actually affect us anything else any way
descartes also maintained matter directly perceivable argued veracity god support proof certain existence
malebranche however weakened descartes' argument concluding philosophical point view existence shown probable
bayle pushed even further down same path thereby laying much ground work immaterialism george berkeley
berkeley influenced both bayle directly malebranche himself simply took final step full denial existence material substance
arthur collier also influenced directly malebranche norris made same move around same time berkeley appear entirely independently
berkeley admittedly reject theory vision god
evident insisted things perceive my own ideas
influenced malebranche's occasionalism even though excluded activity created minds domain
addition berkeley agreed malebranche against descartes achieve clear idea mind itself
john locke also argued made no distinction minds bodies point whereas both berkeley malebranche maintained each own way ideas bodies minds
gottfried wilhelm leibniz met malebranche paris 1675 corresponded thereafter also rejected vision god theory pre-established harmony designed new alternative occasionalism well traditional theory efficient causal interaction
however own theodicy even somewhat elaborate malebranche's least agree malebranche's fundamental contention simplicity god's ways given much regard world's perfection
david hume supported drew upon malebranche's negative arguments show no genuine causal connections conceived distinct mundane entities
however came finding positive replacement such causal connections turned inwards workings human mind instead turning upwards god
regard second half malebranche's occasionalism hume got fairy land long ere reached last steps our theory
our line too short fathom such immense abysses
hume's empiricist epistemology led distrust malebranche's confidence discovering abstruse metaphysical truths through intellectual union god
likewise locke felt malebranche's metaphysical speculations lacked proper foundation though ingenious ultimately unintelligible
somewhat similar manner arthur schopenhauer regarded theory vision god explaining something unknown something even unknown
locke withheld examination p[ère] malebranche's opinion seeing things god publication because looked upon opinion spread like die itself least no great harm
much locke predicted malebranche's reputation outside france enjoyed high esteem begin diminish during 18 th century remained low thereafter
however over last three four decades malebranche's work drawn renewed ever-increasing interest
several works translated english first time scholars reassessing ideas
many[who?] begun argue originality unity philosophical system merits place alongside such figures descartes spinoza leibniz
