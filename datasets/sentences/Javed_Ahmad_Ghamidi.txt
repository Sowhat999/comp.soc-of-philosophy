father belongs town called daud 80 kilometres lahore near ravi river
father follows qadri junaidi sufi order
two elder sisters
early education included modern path matriculation islamia high school pakpattan well traditional path arabic persian languages qur'an mawlawi nur ahmad nang pal
later graduated government college lahore ba honours english 1972
initially interested literature philosophy
later worked renowned islamic scholars like sayyid abul ala maududi amin ahsan islahi various islamic disciplines particularly exegesis islamic law
book maqamat مقامات ghamidi starts essay my name میرا نام describe story behind surname sounds somewhat alien context indian subcontinent
describes desire during childhood years establish name linkage late grandfather noor elahi after learning status people area turned resolve disputes
reputation also led grandfather's reputation peacemaker مصلح
subsequently visiting sufi friends father narrated story patriarch arab tribe banu ghamid earned reputation being great peacemaker
writes temporal closeness these two events clicked mind decided add name ghamidi given name javed ahmed
views works ghamidi ghamidi's understanding islamic law presented concisely book mizan
ghamidi's inspiration mentor amin ahsan islahi non-traditionalist approach religion parted traditionalist understanding number issues never goes out traditional framework
book based own understanding concoctions deviates islamic principles many fashions
jihad ghamidi believes there certain directives qur'an pertaining war specific muhammad certain specified peoples times particularly progeny abraham ishmaelites israelites nazarites
thus muhammad designated followers waged war against divinely specified peoples their time polytheists israelites nazarites arabia other jews christians et al
form divine punishment asked polytheists arabia submission islam condition exoneration others jizya submission political authority muslims exemption death punishment military protection dhimmis muslims
therefore after muhammad companions there no concept islam obliging muslims wage war propagation implementation islam
valid basis jihad through arms end oppression other measures failed
according jihad waged organised islamic state
no person party group take arms their hands purpose waging jihad under any circumstances
another corollary opinion death punishment apostasy also specifically recipients same divine punishment during muhammad's times—for persistently denied truth muhammad's mission even after made conclusively evident them god through muhammad
formation islamic state religious obligation per se upon muslims
however believes muslims form state their own islam does impose certain religious obligations rulers establishment institution salat obligatory prayer zakah mandatory charity 'amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa nahi 'ani'l-munkar preservation promotion society's good conventions customs eradication social vices ghamidi's opinion should done modern times through courts police etc
accordance law land government itself must based opinion majority
qur'an states norms male-female interaction surah an-nur
while surah al-ahzab there special directives muhammad's marriages|wives muhammad directives given muslim women distinguish themselves being harassed medina
qur'an created distinction men women maintain family relations relationships
penal laws islamic punishments hudud islamic law maximum pronouncements mitigated court law basis extenuating circumstances
shariah divine law does stipulate any fixed amount diyya monetary compensation unintentional murder determination amount—for unintentional murder man woman—has left conventions society
ceteris paribus other things being equal woman's testimony equal man's
rape hirabah deserves severe punishments mentioned quran 533
doesn't require four witnesses register case case zina arabic consensual sex
those punished stoning rajm muhammad's time also punished under hirabah raping sexually assaulting women spreading vulgarity society through prostitution
sources islam islam constituted qur'an sunnah
nothing besides these two islam regarded part
just like quran sunnah way prophet muslim nation received through ijma consensus companions prophet tawatur perpetual adherence muslim nation
unlike quran sunnah ahadith explain elucidate contained these two sources also describe exemplary way muhammad followed islam
sharia distinguished fiqh latter being collections interpretations applications sharia muslim jurists
fiqh characterised human exercise therefore subject human weakness differences opinion
muslim obliged adhere school fiqh
taliban islamism ghamidi pakistani religious scholars beginning opposing kind islamism
recent essays subject islam taliban “ taliban says democracy concept alien islam
ideal way setting up islamic government our times adopted mullah omar's government afghanistan
constitution parliament elections nothing modern day shams
say full confidence basis my study islam viewpoint strategy taliban acceptable qur'ān
prescribes democracy way run affairs state
qur'ān 4238 says amruhum shūrā baynahum affairs muslims run basis their consultation
‘umar may allah pleased “whosoever pledges allegiance anyone without collective consent muslims presents himself death sentence
true muslim history monarchy dictatorship often accepted forms government
people also believe head government should nominee god himself
however principle qur’ān spells out very clear
morals ethics ghamidi known stress morals ethics islam
raised concerns moral ethical issues muslims
translated snippet book ikhlaqiyat “ after faith second important requirement religion purification morals
means person should cleanse attitude both towards creator towards fellow human beings
termed righteous deed
shari'ah corollary
change evolution societies civilizations shari'ah indeed changed however faith righteous deeds foundations religion undergone any change
qur'an absolutely clear any person brings forth these two things before almighty day judgement will blessed paradise shall eternal abode
interaction other islamic scholars worked closely abul ala maududi alternative spelling syed maudoodi often referred maulana maududi 1903–1979 nine years before voicing first differences opinion led subsequent expulsion mawdudi's political party jamaat-e-islami 1977
later developed own view religion based hermeneutics ijtihad under influence mentor amin ahsan islahi 1904–1997 well-known exegete indian sub-continent author tadabbur-i-qur'an tafsir exegeses qur'an
ghamidi's critique mawdudi's thought extension wahid al-din khan's criticism mawdudi
khan 1925– amongst first scholars within ranks jamaat-e-islami present full-fledged critique mawdudi's understanding religion
khan's contention mawdudi completely inverted qur'anic worldview
ghamidi part agreed khan basic obligation islam establishment islamic world order servitude god help guide humans their effort fulfill obligation religion revealed
therefore islam never imposed obligation individual adherents islamic state constantly state war against non-islamic world
fact according ghamidi even formation islamic state basic religious obligation muslims
