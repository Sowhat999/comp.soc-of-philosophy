traditionally divided three periods though division arguably arbitrary music each these periods considerably varied
idea twelve-tone period represents stylistically unified body works simply supported musical evidence haimo 1990 4 important musical characteristics—especially those related motivic development—transcend these boundaries completely
first these periods 1894–1907 identified legacy high-romantic composers late nineteenth century well expressionist movements poetry art
second 1908–1922 typified abandonment key centers move often described though schoenberg free atonality
third 1923 onward commences schoenberg's invention dodecaphonic twelve-tone compositional method
schoenberg's best-known students hanns eisler alban berg anton webern followed schoenberg faithfully through each these intellectual aesthetic transitions though without considerable experimentation variety approach
first period late romanticism beginning songs string quartets written around turn century schoenberg's concerns composer positioned uniquely among peers procedures exhibited characteristics both brahms wagner most contemporary listeners considered polar opposites representing mutually exclusive directions legacy german music
schoenberg's six songs op
3 1899–1903 example exhibit conservative clarity tonal organization typical brahms mahler reflecting interest balanced phrases undisturbed hierarchy key relationships
however songs also explore unusually bold incidental chromaticism seem aspire wagnerian representational approach motivic identity
synthesis these approaches reaches apex verklärte nacht op
4 1899 programmatic work string sextet develops several distinctive leitmotif-like themes each eclipsing subordinating last
motivic elements persist throughout work those perpetually dissolved varied re-combined technique identified primarily brahms's music schoenberg called developing variation
schoenberg's procedures work organized two ways simultaneously once suggesting wagnerian narrative motivic ideas well brahmsian approach motivic development tonal cohesion
second period free atonality schoenberg's music 1908 onward experiments variety ways absence traditional keys tonal centers
first explicitly atonal piece second string quartet op

last movement piece no key signature marking schoenberg's formal divorce diatonic harmonies
other important works era include song cycle das buch hängenden gärten op
