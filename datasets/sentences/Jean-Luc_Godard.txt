film contains most written-about scenes cinema's history
them eight-minute tracking shot couple stuck unremitting traffic jam leave city cited new technique godard used deconstruct bourgeois trends
startlingly few shots contain extra footage before beginning take while actors preparing after end take while actors coming out character
week end's enigmatic audacious end title sequence reads end cinema appropriately marked end narrative cinematic period godard's filmmaking career
politics politics never far surface godard's films
earliest features le petit soldat dealt algerian war independence notable attempt present complexity dispute rather pursue any specific ideological agenda
along these lines les carabiniers presents fictional war initially romanticized way characters approach their service becomes stiff anti-war metonym
addition international conflicts godard sought artistic response also very concerned social problems france
earliest best example karina's potent portrayal prostitute vivre sa vie
1960 s paris political milieu overwhelmed specific movement
there however distinct post-war climate shaped various international conflicts such colonialism north africa southeast asia
godard's marxist disposition become abundantly explicit until chinoise week end evident several films—namely pierrot une femme mariée
godard accused harboring anti-semitic views 2010 lead-up presentation godard's honorary oscar prominent article new york times michael cieply drew attention idea circulating through press previous weeks godard might anti-semite thus undeserving accolade
cieply makes reference richard brody's book everything cinema working life jean-luc godard alluded previous longer article published jewish journal lying near origin debate
article also draws upon brody's book example following quotation godard made television 1981 moses my principal enemy
moses received commandments saw images translated them
then brought texts didn't show seen
that's why jewish people accursed
immediately after cieply's article published brody made clear point criticizing extremely selective narrow use passages book noted godard's work approached holocaust greatest moral seriousness
indeed documentaries feature images holocaust context suggesting considers nazism holocaust nadir human history
godard's views become complex regarding state israel
1970 godard traveled middle east make pro-palestinian film didn't complete whose footage eventually became part 1976 film ici et ailleurs
film godard seems view palestinian cause many worldwide leftist revolutionary movements
elsewhere godard explicitly identified himself anti-zionist denied accusations anti-semitism
vietnam war godard produced several pieces directly address vietnam war
furthermore there two scenes pierrot le fou tackle issue
first scene takes place initial car ride ferdinand belmondo marianne karina
over car radio two hear message garrison massacred viet cong lost 115 men
marianne responds extended musing way radio dehumanizes northern vietnamese combatants
same film lovers accost group american sailors along course their liberating crime spree
their immediate reaction expressed marianne damn americans! obvious outlet frustration many french communists felt towards american hegemony
ferdinand then reconsiders that's ok we’ll change our politics
put play
maybe they’ll give us dollars
marianne puzzled ferdinand suggests something americans like vietnam war
ensuing sequence makeshift play marianne dresses up stereotypical vietnamese woman ferdinand american sailor
scene ends brief shot revealing chalk message left floor pair long live mao! vive mao!

brecht's influence keenly felt through much godard's work particularly before 1980 godard used filmic expression specific political ends

godard's direct interaction marxism does become explicitly apparent however until week end name karl marx cited conjunction figures such jesus christ
constant refrain throughout godard's cinematic period bourgeoisie's consumerism commodification daily life activity man's alienation—all central features marx's critique capitalism

way godard treated politics cinematic period context joke piece art relationship presented used tools reference romanticizing marxist rhetoric rather being solely tools education
une femme mariée also structured around marx's concept commodity fetishism
godard once film individuals considered things chases taxi alternate ethological interviews spectacle life intermingled analysis
