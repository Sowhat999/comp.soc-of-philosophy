1992 published dave bayer paper entitled trailing dovetail shuffle lair term coined magician charles jordan early 1900 s established rigorous results how many times deck playing cards must riffle shuffled before considered random according mathematical measure total variation distance
diaconis often cited simplified proposition takes seven shuffles randomize deck
precisely diaconis showed gilbert–shannon–reeds model how likely riffle results particular riffle shuffle permutation takes 5 riffles before total variation distance 52-card deck begins drop significantly maximum value
0 7 riffles before drops below 0
5 very quickly threshold phenomenon after reduced factor 2 every shuffle
interestingly entropy viewed probabilistic distance riffle shuffling seems take less time mix threshold phenomenon goes away because entropy function subadditive
diaconis coauthored several recent papers expanding 1992 results relating problem shuffling cards other problems mathematics
among other things showed separation distance ordered blackjack deck aces top followed 2's followed 3's etc
drops below
5 after 7 shuffles
separation distance upper bound variation distance
