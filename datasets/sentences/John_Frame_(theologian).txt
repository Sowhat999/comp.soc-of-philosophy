rationalism irrationalism non-christian thought frame developing thought mentor cornelius van til asserted both apologetics glory god cornelius van til analysis thought non-christian thought categorized ebb flow rationalism irrationalism
rationalism context frame defines rationalism any attempt establish finite human mind ultimate standard truth falsity
establishing autonomous intellect occurs within context rejecting god’s revelation himself both nature bible
rationalist sense states human mind able fully exhaustively explain reality
yet frame speaks exhaustive explanations does mean these systems seek omniscience
rather means history non-christian thought though admittedly focus western philosophy history various attempts construct systems account everything distinctive metaphysic epistemology value theory
according frame examples attempts explain reality found plato aristotle's form/matter dualism debate nominalists realists over status universals particulars
[fire water atomsetc] pre-socratics
examples include descartes' mind/body dualism spinoza's god nature leibniz's monadology plotinus' teaching emanation british empiricists' attempts limit knowledge possibility empirically verified kant's worlds noumena phenomena hegel's dialectic
frame stated intelligent design scientific just religious neo-darwinism
irrationalism non-christian thought frame's view also characterized irrationalism because inevitably finite fallen human mind cannot fully capture reality man-made system
position point non-christian rationalist realizes cannot account everything engage francis schaeffer called upper story leap
brief example frame uses epistemology kant taught categories thought necessary our understanding world around us such causality logic time space order structured our minds imposed upon things experience
order rational make sense out life must assume presuppose these notions
because cannot empirically verify these categories touch smell sight etc
must thought created arising our minds thus ordering providing criterion those things empirically verify
led kant conclude think anything must think terms everything being caused something logically temporally prior
led fairly deterministic view mankind
frame asks find moral responsibility freedom kant's scheme
argues kant believed while couldn't prove man responsible moral agent must nevertheless act though case
philosophers described these kant’s two worlds world nature leads determinism world freedom responsibility found
kant himself spoke starry skies above moral law within although kant deny regularity natural world reality humanity’s moral motions philosophy bring these two worlds together
frame concludes kant made upper story leap irrationalism asserting truth something no rational justification
thus immanuel kant frame finds both rationalism irrationalism
likewise according both frame van til every non-christian system contains jacques derrida calls alterity each system contains very principles downfall
worship music frame written two books worship music
these provoked controversy frame interprets regulative principle worship subscribes non-conventional manner
