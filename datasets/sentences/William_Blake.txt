vintage anthology blake edited patti smith focuses heavily earlier work many critical studies such william blake
earlier work primarily rebellious character seen protest against dogmatic religion especially notable marriage heaven hell figure represented devil virtually hero rebelling against imposter authoritarian deity
later works such milton jerusalem blake carves distinctive vision humanity redeemed self-sacrifice forgiveness while retaining earlier negative attitude towards felt rigid morbid authoritarianism traditional religion
readers blake agree upon how much continuity exists blake's earlier later works
psychoanalyst june singer written blake's late work displayed development ideas first introduced earlier works namely humanitarian goal achieving personal wholeness body spirit
final section expanded edition her blake study unholy bible suggests later works bible hell promised marriage heaven hell
regarding blake's final poem jerusalem she writes promise divine man made marriage heaven hell last fulfilled
john middleton murry notes discontinuity marriage late works while early blake focused sheer negative opposition energy reason later blake emphasised notions self-sacrifice forgiveness road interior wholeness
renunciation sharper dualism marriage heaven hell evidenced particular humanisation character urizen later works
murry characterises later blake having found mutual understanding mutual forgiveness
sexuality 19 th-century free love movement since death william blake claimed those various movements apply complex often elusive use symbolism allegory issues concern them
particular blake sometimes considered along mary wollstonecraft her husband william godwin forerunner 19 th-century free love movement broad reform tradition starting 1820 s held marriage slavery advocated removal state restrictions sexual activity such homosexuality prostitution adultery culminating birth control movement early 20 th century
blake scholarship focused theme earlier 20 th century today although still mentioned notably blake scholar magnus ankarsjö moderately challenges interpretation
19 th-century free love movement particularly focused idea multiple partners agree wollstonecraft state-sanctioned marriage legal prostitution monopolistic character
somewhat common early feminist movements particularly regard writings mary wollstonecraft whom blake admired
blake critical marriage laws day generally railed against traditional christian notions chastity virtue
time tremendous strain marriage part due catherine's apparent inability bear children directly advocated bringing second wife house
poetry suggests external demands marital fidelity reduce love mere duty rather authentic affection decries jealousy egotism motive marriage laws

foster damon noted blake major impediments free love society corrupt human nature merely intolerance society jealousy men inauthentic hypocritical nature human communication
thomas wright's 1928 book life william blake entirely devoted blake's doctrine free love notes blake thinks marriage should practice afford joy love notes reality often does couple's knowledge being chained often diminishes their joy
pierre berger also analyses blake's early mythological poems such ahania declaring marriage laws consequence fallenness humanity these born pride jealousy
scholars noted blake's views free love both qualified may undergone shifts modifications late years
poems period warn dangers predatory sexuality such sick rose
magnus ankarsjö notes while hero visions daughters albion strong advocate free love end poem she become circumspect her awareness dark side sexuality grown crying love drinks another sponge drinks water? ankarsjö also notes major inspiration blake mary wollstonecraft similarly developed circumspect views sexual freedom late life
light blake's aforementioned sense human 'fallenness' ankarsjö thinks blake does fully approve sensual indulgence merely defiance law exemplified female character leutha since fallen world experience love enchained
ankarsjö records blake having supported commune sharing partners though david worrall read book thel rejection proposal take concubines espoused members swedenborgian church
blake's later writings show renewed interest christianity although radically reinterprets christian morality way embraces sensual pleasure there little emphasis sexual libertarianism found several early poems there advocacy self-denial though such abnegation must inspired love rather through authoritarian compulsion
berger swinburne especially sensitive shift sensibility early blake later blake
berger believes young blake placed too much emphasis following impulses older blake better formed ideal true love sacrifices self
celebration mystical sensuality remains late poems most notably blake's denial virginity jesus's mother
