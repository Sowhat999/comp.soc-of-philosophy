suggested article merged lacanianism
discuss proposed since august 2014
lacanian movement comprises various followings innovative dissident french psychoanalyst jacques lacan
lacanianism began philosophical/linguistic re-interpretation freud's original teachings
how far subsequently became independent body thought remains matter debate — lacan himself famously informing followers up you lacanians you wish
am freudian
wide extent lacan's evolving intellectual stances inability find settled institutional framework work meant over time lacanian movement subject numerous schisms continuing divisions
contents lacan's lifetime 2 criticism 3 post-lacan 3
typology 4 see also 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links lacan's lifetime three main phases may identified lacan's mature work fifties exploration imaginary symbolic concern real lost object desire objet petit during sixties final phase highlighting jouissance mathematical formulation psychoanalytic teaching
fifties lacan developed distinctive style teaching based linguistic reading freud too built up substantial following within société française de psychanalyse [sfp] serge leclaire first many french lacanians
phase teaching memorialised écrits first found way english-speaking world lacanians thus found english philosophy departments clinical practice
however very extent lacan's following raised serious criticisms accused both abusing positive transference tie analysands himself magnifying their numbers use shortened analytic sessions
questionable nature following reasons failure gain recognition teaching ipa recognition french form freudianism lacanianism — failure led founding école freudienne de paris efp 1964
many closest most creative followers such jean laplanche chose ipa over lacan point first many subsequent lacanian schisms
élisabeth roudinesco suggested after founding efp “the history psychoanalysis france became subordinate lacanianism
lacanian movement occupied thereafter motor position relation other movements obliged determine their course'”
there certainly large expansion numbers school arguably expense quantity over quality flood psychologists submerged analysts come sfp
protests against new regime reached head introduction self-certifying 'passe' analytic status old comrades such françois perrier broke away bitter schism 1968 found quatrieme groupe
however major divisions remained within edf underwent another painful split over question analytic qualifications
there remained within movement broad division old guard first generation lacanians' focused symbolic — study freud through structural linguistic tools fifties — younger group mathematicians philosophers centred jacques-alain miller favoured self-contained lacanianism formalised free freudian roots
seventies lacan spoke mathematicisation psychoanalysis coined term 'matheme' describe formulaic abstraction leclaire brusquely dismissed new formulas “graffiti” nevertheless despite these other tensions edf held together under charisma their master until despairing followers lacan himself dissolved school 1980 year before death
criticism frederick crews writes deleuze guattari indicted lacanian psychoanalysis capitalist disorder pilloried analysts most sinister priest-manipulators psychotic society anti-oedipus their demonstration widely regarded unanswerable devastated already shrinking lacanian camp paris
post-lacan start eighties saw lacanian movement dissolve plethora new organisations millerite ecole de cause freudienne ecf 273 members centre de formation et de recherches psychoanalytiques cfrp 390 members perhaps most important
1993 another fourteen associations grown out former edf nor process stop there
early resignations splits ecf followed late 1990 s massive exodus analysts world-wide miller's organisation under allegations misuse authority
attempts made re-unite various factions leclaire arguing lacanianism “becoming ossifed stiffening kind war religion theoretical debates no longer contribute anything new”
french lacanianism particular haunted past betrayals conflict — faction after faction claiming their segment lacanian thought genuine — reunification any kind proven very problematic roudinesco perhaps correct conclude “'lacanianism born subversion wish transgress essentially doomed fragility dispersal”
typology three main divisions made contemporary lacanianism
form academic reading de-clinicalised lacan become pursuit itself
self-styled legitimatism ecf developed international movement strong spanish support well latin american roots set itself up rival challenge ipa
third form plural lacanianism best epitomiesd moderate cfrp abandonment passe openness traditional psychoanalysis after 1995 dissolution two successors
attempts rejoin ipa remain problematic however least due persistence 'short session' lacan's rejection countertransference therapeutic tool
