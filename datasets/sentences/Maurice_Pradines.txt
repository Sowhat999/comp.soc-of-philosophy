maurice pradines 28 march 1874 march 1958 french philosopher
although thought largely original pradines may categorized among interwar period philosophers mind
also professor developed philosophy knowledge light problems sensation
pradinesian thought work pradines problem sensation brought back union soul body
number classic authors including rené descartes nicolas malebranche considered their separation theoretically
pradines posed inverse thesis immanence mind body
indeed any primary developed psychic phenomenon above belongs living being
how then body proceed mind? pradines endeavored show order explain relationship necessary constitute history genesis life mind
mind something living then question must answered life? pradines distinguished two modalities life needy life defensive life
characterized their respective movements movement involution defined living thing's tendency preserve itself
living thing perdures organizing itself
hand capable withdrawing itself other hand persevere distinction respect itself
movement evolution defined confrontation collaboration alterity constitutes reality
initially person egoistic tendency likes himself
order perdure must find means preserving himself
consequently will no other choice confront himself world
contact exteriority capital will make possible distinction soul mind
tendency first preservation tension originating toward self toward others self life love animation soul
soul first degree spiritualization living thing tendency towards something
consequently how does soul constitute mind? here sensation intervenes urgent point pradinesian thought distinguished two categories needy sensitivity body seeks useful
defensive sensitivity consists fleeing threatens
according pradines philosophy never correctly wondered problem sensation
takes aim empirists those missed essential held sensation starting point knowledge
reality philosophy almost sticks causes never function
sensation function precisely primary importance since someone provokes living body does provocation interests body acquires meaning life
sensation psychic phenomemon life gives itself something understand reality confronted
nevertheless proves paramount first criteron mind
preceded affectivity because necessary perceive order sense
here again pradines distinguishes two occurrences affective sensitive sensitivity being impersonal does provide knowledge object states pain pleasure respect
located any precise part body
sensory sensitivity sensoriality perceptive function given organs generating less precise information
sensoriality makes possible meaning need defense
less affective
because affectivity fuzzy vague cannot divided degrees sensoriality instead less representative
affectivity affective sensitivity characterized pleasure pain these two extremes sensoriality will able exert itself
point sensation becomes perception call insensitive sensation
then made apparent paradox? space constituted sensoriality perceive us according our adaptation reality
meaning defense allow ourselves through thermal tactition mechanical tactition hearing sight etc
because there escape there through detachment foresight possible pain
these meanings specific space thus mind because blindly embrace reality permit intellectual knowledge through depth establish our relationships objects
being forced differentiate space living thing accedes world mind say intelligence knowledge
