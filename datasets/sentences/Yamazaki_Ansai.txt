canon consisted mostly classic confucian writings zhu xi emphasized elementary learning reflections things hand four books great learning doctrine mean analects confucius mencius
however also included cheng yi's commentary book changes
1660 s 1670 s ansai following example zhu xi personally edited six books comprised canon
teacher ansai described students extremely strict sometimes scary short tempered
generally speaking ansai reputation being single minded doctrinate intolerant
kaibara ekken contemporary ansai's attended several lectures found ansai severe dogmatic interested strict moral discipline investigation principles practical learning
such prominent neo-confucian scholars kinoshita jun'an asami keisai miyake shōsai satō naokata included amongst ansai's followers kimon school
bakufu involvement shinto beginnings 1658 ansai moved edo spent next 7 years life continuing studying neo-confucian texts well beginning research never completed historiography japan based upon shinto texts
1665 after building up reputation both edo kyoto extraordinary teacher invited hoshina masayuki daimyo aizu become teacher
ansai accepted position spent next seven years life personal teacher neo-confucian philosophy masayuki
tutoring masayuki six out twelve months year ansai given salary 100 gold ryō two seasonal garments haori coat
although ansai masayuki share close relationship ansai refused become vassal declaring confucian scholars should remain autonomous another individual's influence
masayuki proved ansai's intellectual equal helping compile five different works two gazetteers aizu domain three confucian texts gyokusan kōgi furoku appendix zhu xi's lecture yushan nitei jikyōroku record two cheng's political teachings irakusanshiden shinroku record mind-heart
during years service masayuki ansai compiled writings zhu xi during off time kyoto
these included jinsetsumondō questions answers explanations humaneness shōgaku mōyōshu daigaku keihatsu shū collections [clarifications zhu xi] elementary learning great learning
due relationship ansai considered scholars most closely associated tokugawa bakufu
also ansai able receive secret teachings yoshida ise shinto traditions use attempting reconstruct pure shinto reflect way neo-confucianism
later years schism kimon school after masayuki's death 1672 ansai returned kyoto spent last decade life
later years ansai's scholarly focus dramatically shifted toward project synchronizing shinto confucian thought
ansai's introduction shinto teachings ultimately caused schism among students dividing them two groups those followed ansai's confucianism those followed shinto
very few able both
1680 ansai put forth radical re-interpretation great learning defied traditional confucian thought falling out two best students satō naokata asami keisai accept ansai's new interpretation
ultimately ansai expelled naokata keisai
after most students coalesced around two defrocked pupils thinning out ranks ansai's still loyal followers
formerly great school ruins ansai died september 16 1682 buried korotani mountain kyoto
split buddhism ansai's rejection buddhism based upon perceived fundamental insufficiency/flaw buddhist moral principles
neo confucianism ansai found truth universal eternal cosmic way found buddhism
critique based upon two interconnected fallacies perceived buddhist thought
first ansai believed buddhism lacked normative system informing ethical behavior stemming interpretation buddhist notion nature sei nothingness emptiness metaphysical ethical ideal
due buddhism contained no theory mind-heart thus inadequate cultivating mind both integral ansai's ethical thought
ansai's neo-confucian perspective mind full being inherently imbued concepts five relationships five virtues empty believed buddhism perceived
latter part life ansai attempting prove ontological unity shinto confucianism proclaimed before arrival buddhism japan early shinto confucianism identical
blamed influence buddhist thought creating false dichotomy two systems ansai's view differed name
neo-confucian teachings influence zhu xi ansai's teachings seen part larger neo-confucian trend early tokugawa period referred abe yoshino rigaku school principle
compared kigaku school material force rigaku's primary focus moral cultivation spirituality
followers considered ri chinese li reason rational principle law transcendent principle
although ansai part larger movement no way see himself innovator neo-confucianism
rather saw himself servant truth transmitter way believed nothing taught novel since everything way already confucian sages
particular ansai believed faithful transmitter writings both zhu xi korean neo-confucian yi t'oegye 1507–1570 special emphasis zhu's teachings
because most ansai's neo confucian writings tended publications zhu xi's works own commentaries
although ansai's teachings varied slightly zhu xi's foundation ansai's thought deeply grounded zhu's most fundamental premises
foremost these zhu xi's cosmological belief principles reason morality li same mankind's original nature
principles guide move universe exactly same those inform man's ethical behavior
therefore pursuing li individual simultaneously developing potential one's inner nature guide behaving correctly
individual endure able bring own natural inclinations perfect harmony principles universal morality
zhu xi saw fulfillment potential ideal state human existence possible achieve obey one's allotted moral duty given their relative position society
depending their social role duties individual differed principles upon grounded
however zhu xi view problematic since each these principles merely different manifestation same general principle morality found every human being
xi believed fulfilling one's proper social role means understanding universal principle human morality li
referred such process plumbing principle
perfect one's natural innate potential same time realize one's self autonomous being
reverence like zhu xi ansai firmly believed individual's moral duties reflected specific social position meibun
however instead focusing plumbing principle believed average person incapable achieving ansai believed order properly achieve meibun primary attitude reverence kei tsutsushimi steadiness mind guarded behavior
since zhu considered reverence necessary precondition plumbing principle ansai believed reverence essential element zhu's moral thought
end placed great emphasis particular passage zhu xi's reverence within righteousness without
[citation needed] reverence means achieved desired end self-cultivation necessary fulfill moral duties prescribed individual their rigid social obligations
realizing one's social obligations maintaining orderly hierarchical society highest duties individual mankind respectively fulfill
notion stems ansai's morality cosmology interconnectedness two based zhu xi's thought
ontology morality like zhu xi ansai believed principles guided cosmic order same ethical principles informed mankind's original nature
same set principles guided cosmic well human world
there inherent connection macrocosm cosmos microcosm humans mutually influenced each other reciprocal parallel manner
just cosmic principles actively affect mankind informing humans their natural moral imperatives human beings actively affect cosmic order through their collective behavior
why ansai believed moral imperative human beings achieve unity cosmos
understanding ethical principles simultaneously understand cosmic principles positively affect themselves universe well
linked morality five evolutive phases show cosmic moral principles natural inevitable mutually influence another
physicist philosopher max bernhard weinstein found these views especially consonant theological theory pandeism
cosmology filial piety because cosmologically everything interconnected ansai believed actions individual similar manner modern chaos theory affect entire universe
stressed confucian concept great learning person's actions center series concentric circles extend outward toward family society finally cosmos
five virtues contained idea reverence inherent man's original nature direct five relationships parent child humaneness lord vassal righteousness/duty husband wife propriety elder younger wisdom friend friend faithfulness
there five steps zhu xi advocated perfect these relationships virtues study wisely question thoroughly deliberate carefully analyze clearly act conscientiously
ansai learning means ends morality
however relationships virtues ansai emphasized relationship lord vassal duty most important
departing zhu xi saw humaneness most important virtue ansai believed maintaining social order through duty one's lord highest responsibility fulfill
knowledge leads morality achieve reverence means toward personal cultivation ansai proposed quiet sitting
through quiet sitting ansai believed individual gain access storehouse hidden knowledge inherent individuals
storehouse qi vital material force resides
channeling qi able stimulate humaneness consequently triggers other virtues
through knowledge virtue grows
through virtue act proper accord outside world cosmos general
thus knowledge source individual realizes innate human potential described zhu xi
suika shinto interest shinto failed attempt creating historiography japan ansai became intensely interested shinto's religious elements
own experience ansai believed certain shinto customs rituals such funeral practices reflected confucian values
yamato shōgaku japanese elementary learning published 1658 although focused general social customs marks turning point ansai's thought inclusion various shinto elements
latter part life ansai began project combining neo-confucian morality based zhu xi religious elements shinto
since ansai believed ontological unity everything believed shinto tradition discover way rooted japanese society
ansai's confucian interpretation shinto mythology came known suika shinto
suika means act praying call gods down receive worldly benefits
drawing secret traditions both yoshida ise shinto well classic shinto myths such found kojiki nihongi shoku nihongi fudoki etc
ansai able uncover numerous neo-confucian values within shinto texts
november 23 1672 created record fuji no mori shrine fuji no mori yuzuemandokoro no ki essay generally summarizes ansai's views shinto connection neo-confucian metaphysics
confucian ethics embedded shinto shinto texts found particular moral values believed counterparts confucianism
example believed confucian notion reverence same shinto idea prayer kitō
righteousness confucianism equivalent shinto idea honesty forthrightness massugu shōjiki
opening chapters nihongi ansai explained five generations earthly gods kami equivalent five evolutive phases pledge amaterasu protect divine lineage her descendants along yamato-hime's prophecy keeping right right left left expressions values way loyalty selflessness steadfast vigilant mind
although ansai claimed trying discover confucian values within shinto discoveries profound effect personal philosophy
interpretation passage nihongi ō-ana-muchi converses own spirit ansai believed every person's body shrine houses living spirit
effect every person's physical heart contained living god out reverence gods should worship self
believed analogous confucian practice self-cultivation
shinto's influence ansai's thought ansai's interpretations shinto texts also surprisingly lead affirmation political order tokugawa bakufu
believed just much emperor bakufu part sacred political order these warriors exemplified archetype susanoo
divine mandate bakufu entrusted protect political realm name emperor
political order ansai reflected greater cosmic unity heaven man
due belief unity ansai challenged traditional confucian notion mandate heaven ruler held accountable welfare subjects lose legitimacy act proper accord
however ansai believed challenging political authority paramount disrupting harmonic balance heaven man
therefore subject must pledge undying unconditional loyalty master
idea caused great controversy amongst ansai's followers kimon school well amongst suika shinto disciples
methodology book tokugawa ideology herman ooms describes ansai's analysis shinto texts being grounded hermeneutic operations proceeding along four levels interpretation
first level literal
ooms' perspective ansai believed shinto texts read records historical facts
kami existed ansai believed them
second ansai employs allegorical interpretation text analogically equating symbols found within shinto texts expressions confucian truths
third ansai interpreted texts moral level drawing ethical paradigms out shinto myths
last level anagogical whereby ansai argued supremacy japanese nation relative others using own interpretations shinto texts
although often ansai criticized 'torturous rationalizations found suika shinto ooms argues distinguishes ansai other neo-confucian scholars time systematic structure thought
influence/legacy yamazaki ansai part larger movement early tokugawa era revived helped proliferate neo-confucian thought japan
first introduce writings korean neo-confucian scholar yi t'ogeye japan instrumental popularizing zhu xi's thought partly due connections government
political theory appropriated tokugawa bakufu means legitimate suppression political contestation
institutions ansai created kimon school suika shinto last very long their original forms ansai intended
however power ansai's ideas influence exerted large number students vast repercussions
ansai's suika shinto transformed shinto political ideology later incorporated ultra-nationalist thinkers 18 th 19 th centuries
scholarly research shinto texts ansai able break monopoly shinto doctrine freeing private storehouses specialist shinto circles yoshida ise thereby making available future generations freely study interpret
although kimon school suffered various schisms both during after ansai's time lineage lasted until present times
after ansai's death students continued preach form confucian suika shinto thought both commoners bakufu officials alike
large number kimon scholars later filled ranks bakufu college during kansei reforms
