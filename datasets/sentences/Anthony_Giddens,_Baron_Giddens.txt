finally also known interdisciplinary approach commented developments sociology also anthropology archaeology psychology philosophy history linguistics economics social work most recently political science
view knowledge works may view much life's work form 'grand synthesis' sociological theory
nature sociology before 1976 most giddens' writings offered critical commentary wide range writers schools traditions
giddens took stance against then-dominant structural functionalism represented talcott parsons well criticising evolutionism historical materialism
capitalism modern social theory 1971 examined work weber durkheim marx arguing despite their different approaches each concerned link capitalism social life
giddens emphasised social constructs power modernity institutions defining sociology “ study social institutions brought being industrial transformation past two three centuries
new rules sociological method 1976 title alludes durkheim's rules sociological method 1895 giddens attempted explain 'how sociology should done' addressed long-standing divide those theorists prioritise 'macro level' studies social life — looking 'big picture' society — those emphasise 'micro level' — everyday life means individuals
new rules
noted functionalist approach invented durkheim treated society reality unto itself reducible individuals
rejected durkheim's sociological positivism paradigm attempted predict how societies operate ignoring meanings understood individuals
giddens noted “ society form form effects people insofar structure produced reproduced people
contrasted durkheim weber's approach — interpretative sociology — focused understanding agency motives individuals
giddens closer weber durkheim analysis rejects both those approaches stating while society collective reality nor should individual treated central unit analysis
rather uses logic hermeneutic tradition interpretative sociology argue importance agency sociological theory claiming human social actors degree knowledgeable doing
social order therefore result pre-planned social actions automatic evolutionary response
sociologists unlike natural scientists interpret social world already interpreted actors inhabit
according giddens there duality structure social practice principal unit investigation both structural agency-component
structural environment constrains individual behaviour also makes possible
also noted existence specific form social cycle once sociological concepts formed filter back everyday world change way people think
because social actors reflexive monitor ongoing flow activities structural conditions adapt their actions their evolving understandings
result social scientific knowledge society will actually change human activities
giddens calls two-tiered interpretive dialectical relationship social scientific knowledge human practices double hermeneutic
giddens also stressed importance power means ends hence directly involved actions every person
power transformative capacity people change social material world closely shaped knowledge space-time
new rules
giddens specifically sociology 'pre-given' universe objects universe being constituted — produced — active doings subjects
production reproduction society thus treated skilled performance part members
realm human agency bounded
individuals produce society historically located actors under conditions their own choosing
structures must conceptualised constraints upon human agency also enablers
processes structuration involve interplay meanings norms power
sociological observer cannot make social life available 'phenomenon' observation independently drawing upon knowledge resource whereby constitutes 'topic investigation'
immersion form life necessary means whereby observer able generate such characterisations
sociological concepts thus obey double hermeneutic
sum primary tasks sociological analysis following hermeneutic explication mediation divergent forms life within descriptive metalanguages social science 2 explication production reproduction society accomplished outcome human agency
structuration details topic see theory structuration
giddens' theory structuration explores question whether individuals social forces shape our social reality
eschews extreme positions arguing although people entirely free choose their own actions their knowledge limited nonetheless agency reproduces social structure leads social change
ideas find echo philosophy modernist poet wallace stevens suggests live tension shapes take world acts upon us ideas order our imagination imposes upon world
giddens writes connection structure action fundamental element social theory structure agency duality cannot conceived apart another main argument contained expression duality structure
basic level means people make society same time constrained
action structure cannot analysed separately structures created maintained changed through actions while actions given meaningful form through background structure line causality runs both directions making impossible determine changing
giddens own words new rules
“ social structures both constituted human agency yet same time very medium constitution
regard defines structures consisting rules resources involving human action rules constrain actions resources make possible
also differentiates systems structures
systems display structural properties structures themselves
notes article functionalism après lutte 1976 “ examine structuration social system examine modes whereby system through application generative rules resources produced reproduced social interaction
process structures reproducing systems called structuration
systems here mean giddens situated activities human agents constitution society
patterning social relations across space-time ibid
structures then
sets rules resources individual actors draw upon practices reproduce social systems’ politics sociology social theory systems generative rules sets implicated articulation social systems constitution society
existing virtually out time out space new rules
structuration therefore means relations took shape structure exist out time place other words independent context created
example relationship teacher student come across each other another context say street hierarchy them still preserved
structure act constraint action also enables action providing common frames meaning
consider example language structure language represented rules syntax rule out certain combinations words
structure also provides rules allow new actions occur enabling us create new meaningful sentences
structures should conceived simply placing constrains upon human agency enabling
new rules
giddens suggests structures traditions institutions moral codes other sets expectations — established ways doing things generally quite stable changed especially through unintended consequences action people start ignore them replace them reproduce them differently
thus actors agents employ social rules appropriate their culture ones learned through socialisation experience
these rules together resources their disposal used social interactions
rules resources employed manner deterministic applied reflexively knowledgeable actors albeit actors’ awareness may limited specifics their activities any given time
thus outcome action totally predictable
connections micro macro structuration very useful synthesising micro macro issues
micro scale individuals' internal sense self identity consider example family increasingly free choose our own mates how relate them creates new opportunities also work relationship becomes reflexive project interpreted maintained
yet micro-level change cannot explained looking individual level people spontaneously change their minds how live neither assume directed social institutions state
macro scale state social organisations like multinational capitalist corporations consider example globalization offers vast new opportunities investment development crises — like asian financial crisis — affect entire world spreading far outside local setting first developed last least directly influences individuals
serious explanation such issues must lie somewhere within network macro micro forces
these levels should treated unconnected fact significant relation another
illustrate relationship giddens discusses changing attitudes towards marriage developed countries
claims any effort explain phenomenon solely terms micro macro level causes will result circular cause consequence
social relationships visible sexuality micro-level change related decline religion rise rationality macro-level change also changes laws relating marriage sexuality macro change caused different practices changing attitudes level everyday lives micro
practices attitudes turn affected social movements example women's liberation egalitarianism macro-scale phenomena movements usually grow out everyday life grievances — micro-scale phenomenon
increasingly tied mass media our main providers information
media merely reflect social world also actively shape being central modern reflexivity
david gauntlett writes media gender identity “ importance media propagating many modern lifestyles should obvious
range lifestyles — lifestyle ideals — offered media may limited same time usually broader those expect just 'bump into' everyday life
media modernity offers possibilities celebrates diversity also offers narrow interpretations certain roles lifestyles — depending you look
another example explored giddens emergence romantic love giddens transformation intimacy links rise 'narrative self' type self-identity romantic love introduced idea narrative individual's life
although history sex clearly demonstrates passion sex modern phenomena discourse romantic love developed late 18 th century
romanticism 18 th 19 th century european macro-level cultural movement responsible emergence novel — relatively early form mass media
growing literacy popularity novels fed back mainstream lifestyle romance novel proliferated stories ideal romantic life narratives micro-level giving romantic love important recognised role marriage-type relationship
consider also transformation intimacy
giddens asserts intimate social relationships become 'democratised' bond partners even within marriage little external laws regulations social expectations based internal understanding two people trusting bond based emotional communication
such bond ceases exist modern society generally happy relationship dissolved
thus 'a democracy emotions everyday life' runaway world 1999
inevitably giddens concludes social change stems mixture micro- macro-level forces
self-identity giddens says post-traditional order self-identity reflexive
quality moment account person's life
giddens writes modernity self-identity 54 “ person's identity found behaviour nor — important though — reactions others capacity keep particular narrative going
individual's biography she maintain regular interaction others day-to-day world cannot wholly fictive
must continually integrate events occur external world sort them ongoing 'story' self
ever before access information allows us reflect causes consequences our actions
same time faced dangers related unintended consequences our actions our reliance knowledge experts
create maintain revise set biographical narratives social roles lifestyles story how came now
increasingly free choose want want although giddens contends wealth gives access options
increased choice both liberating troubling
liberating sense increasing likelihood one's self-fulfilment troubling form increased emotional stress time needed analyse available choices minimise risk increasingly aware giddens sums up manufacturing uncertainty
while earlier traditional societies provided narrative social role post-traditional society usually forced create ourselves
giddens modernity self-identity 70 puts “ do? how act? be? these focal questions everyone living circumstances late modernity — ones level another us answer either discursively through day-to-day social behaviour
modernity giddens' recent work concerned question characteristic social institutions various points history
giddens agrees there very specific changes mark our current era argues post-modern era just radicalised modernity era similar zygmunt bauman's concept liquid modernity produced extension same social forces shaped previous age
giddens nonetheless differentiates pre-modern modern late high modern societies doesn't dispute important changes occurred takes neutral stance towards those changes saying offers both unprecedented opportunities unparalleled dangers
also stresses haven't really gone beyond modernity
it's just developed detraditionalised radicalised 'late' modernity
thus phenomena called 'postmodern' giddens nothing most extreme instances developed modernity
along ulrich beck scott lash endorses term reflexive modernisation accurate description processes associated second modernity since opposes itself earlier version instead opposing traditionalism endangering very institutions created such national state political parties nuclear family
giddens concentrates contrast traditional pre-modern culture post-traditional modern culture
traditional societies individual actions need extensively thought because available choices already determined customs traditions etc
contrast post-traditional society people actors agents much less concerned precedents set earlier generations choices due flexibility law public opinion
however means individual actions now require analysis thought before taken
society reflexive aware something giddens fascinated illustrating examples ranging state governance intimate relationships
giddens examines three realms particular experience identity connections intimacy political institutions
most defining property modernity according giddens disembedded time space
pre-modern societies space area moved time experience while moving
modern societies however social space no longer confined boundaries set space moves
now imagine other spaces look like even never there
regard giddens talks virtual space virtual time
another distinctive property modernity lies field knowledge
pre-modern societies elders possessed knowledge definable time space
modern societies must rely expert systems
these present time space must trust them
even trust them know something go wrong there's risk take
also technologies use transform constraints means hold risks
consequently there heightened sense uncertainty contemporary societies
also regard giddens uses image 'juggernaut' modernity like unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space
humanity tries steer long modern institutions their uncertainty endure will never able influence course
uncertainty however managed 'reembedding' expert-systems structures accustomed
another characteristic enhanced reflexivity both level individuals level institutions
latter requires explanation modern institutions there component studies institutions themselves purpose enhancing effectiveness
enhanced reflexivity enabled language became increasingly abstract transition pre-modern modern societies becoming institutionalised universities
also regard giddens talks double hermeneutica every action two interpretations
actor himself other investigator tries give meaning action observing
actor performs action however get know interpretation investigator therefore change own interpretation further line action
reason positive science according giddens[citation needed] never possible social sciences every time investigator tries identify causal sequences action actors change their further line action
problem however conflicting viewpoints social science result disinterest people
example scientists don't agree greenhouse-effect people will withdraw arena deny there problem
therefore sciences expand uncertainty there modern society
regard juggernaut gets even steerless
while emancipatory politics politics life chances life politics politics lifestyle
life politics politics reflexively mobilised order — system late modernity — individual collective level radically altered existential parameters social activity
politics self-actualisation reflexively ordered environment reflexivity links self body systems global scope
life politics concerns political issues flow processes self-actualisation post-traditional contexts globalising influences intrude deeply reflexive project self conversely processes self-realisation influence global strategies
— anthony giddens modernity self-identity
self society late modern age contemporary critique historical materialism giddens concludes there exists no necessary overall mechanism social change no universal motor history such class conflict there no universal stages periodisation social development these being ruled out intersocietal systems time-space edges ever-presence exogenous variables well human agency inherent historicity societies societies needs other those individuals notions such adaptation cannot properly applied them pre-capitalist societies class-divided capitalism there class societies there endemic class conflict separation political economic spheres property freely alienable capital free labour labour markets while class conflict integral capitalist society there no teleology guarantees emergence working class universal class no ontology justifies denial multiple bases modern society represented capitalism industrialism bureaucratisation surveillance industrialisation warfare sociology subject pre-eminently modernity addresses reflexive reality
third way age late reflexive modernity post scarcity economy political science being transformed
giddens notes there possibility life politics politics self-actualisation may become visible emancipatory politics politics inequality new social movements may lead social change political parties reflexive project self changes gender sexual relations may lead way via democratisation democracy new era habermasian dialogic democracy differences settled practices ordered through discourse rather violence commands authority
giddens relying past familiar themes reflexivity system integration places people new relations trust dependency each other their governments argues political concepts 'left' 'right' now breaking down result many factors most centrally absence clear alternative capitalism eclipse political opportunities based social class favour those based lifestyle choices
most recent works giddens moves away explaining how things demanding attempt advocacy how ought
beyond left right 1994 giddens criticises market socialism constructs six-point framework reconstituted radical politics repair damaged solidarities recognise centrality life politics accept active trust implies generative politics embrace dialogic democracy rethink welfare state confront violence third way 1998 provides framework within 'third way' - giddens also terms 'radical centre' - justified
addition third way supplies broad range policy proposals aimed giddens calls 'progressive centre-left' british politics
according giddens “ overall aim third way politics should help citizens pilot their way through major revolutions our time globalisation transformations personal life our relationship nature
giddens remains fairly optimistic future humanity “ there no single agent group movement marx's proletariat supposed carry hopes humanity there many points political engagement offer good cause optimism
beyond left right giddens discards possibility single comprehensive all-connecting ideology political programme
instead advocates going after 'small pictures' ones people directly affect their home workplace local community
giddens difference pointless utopianism useful utopian realism defines envisaging alternative futures whose very propagation might help them realised
consequences modernity
'utopian' means something new extraordinary 'realistic' stresses idea rooted existing social processes viewed their simple extrapolation
such future centre socialised demilitarised planetary-caring global world order variously articulated within green women's peace movements within wider democratic movement
1999 giddens delivered bbc reith lectures subject ‘runaway world’ subsequently published book title

saif gaddafi driving force behind rehabilitation potential modernisation libya
gaddafi sr however authorising these processes
during second visit monitor group organised panel three thinkers giddens gaddafi benjamin barber author jihad vs
mc world chaired sir david frost
giddens remarked meetings gaddafi you usually get half hour political leader recalls
my conversation lasts three
gaddafi relaxed clearly enjoys intellectual conversation
likes term 'third way’ because own political philosophy version idea
makes many intelligent perceptive points
leave enlivened encouraged
theory 'reflexivity' giddens introduces 'reflexivity' information societies information gathering considered routinised process greater protection nation
information gathering known concept 'individuation
individuality comes result individuation people given 'informed choices
information government person entitlements given citizens
process information gathering helps government identify 'enemies-of-the-state' singling out individuals suspicious plotting activities against state
advent technology brought national security complete new level
historically military relied armed force deal threats
development ict biometric scans language translation real time programs other related intelligent programs made identification terrorist activities much easier compared past
analysing algorithm patterns biometric databases given government new leads
data citizens collected through identification credential verification companies
hence surveillance ict goes hand-in-hand information gathering
other words collection information necessary 'stringent safeguards' protection nation preventing imminent attacks
living high opportunity high risk society giddens vigorously pursued theme globalization recent years
sees growing interdependence world society driven increasing integration world economy above massive advances communications
noted delivered bbc reith lectures just before turn century internet infancy
now expanded wholly unprecedented way - linking people organizations across world everyday level also intruding deeply everyday life
billions people access numbers growing every day
increasingly interconnected wired-up world offers many advantages benefits
yet carries new risks too themselves global proportions
21 st century work opportunity risk combine never before
giddens refers emergence global level ‘high opportunity high risk society’
both level opportunity risk terrain human beings never explored before
don’t know advance balance likely because many opportunities risks quite new can’t draw past history assess them
climate change those new risks
no other civilization before advent modern industrialism able intervene nature even fraction extent everyday basis
climate change referred several giddens’s books mid-1990 s onwards discussed length until publication work politics climate change 2009
climate change giddens says constitutes fundamental threat future industrial civilisation spreads across globe
given case asks why countries around world doing little counter advance? many reasons involved prime historical novelty humanly induced climate change itself
no previous civilisation intervened nature level remotely similar everyday level today
no previous experience dealing such issue especially such global scope dangers poses
those dangers hence appear abstract located indefinite point future
‘giddens’s paradox’ consists following theorem
likely put off responding adequately climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected occur then definition will too late
no way reversing build-up greenhouses gases driving transformation world’s climate
such gases will atmosphere centuries
