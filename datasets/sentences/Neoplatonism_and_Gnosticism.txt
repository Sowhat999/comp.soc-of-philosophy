precise term group suggested scholar john
turner orthodox neo platonism
gnosticism term created modern scholars describe collection religious groups many thought themselves christians active first few centuries ad
there considerable scholarly controversy over exactly sects fall within grouping
sometimes gnosticism used narrowly refer religious groups such sethians archontics seem used term gnostikoi self-designation even though early platonists ebionites also used term considered gnostics
sometimes used little broadly include groups similar influenced sethians such followers basilides valentinius later paulicians
sometimes used even broadly cover groups heavily emphasized gnosis therefore including hermetics neoplatonists well

plato's original use terms gnostikoi gnostike episteme text known politikos greek politicus latin 258 e-267
work modern name statesman gnosis meant knowledge influence control
gnostike episteme also used indicate one's aptitude
plato's writings terms appear intimate anything esoteric hidden rather express sort higher intelligence ability akin talent
within text politikos stranger main speaker dialog indicates best political leaders those certain knowledge indicative competency rule
gnosis therefore quality characteristic ideal attendee platonic academy since high aptitude necessary qualification understand grasp teachings
although greek stem gno- common use like many new words formed -tikos gnostikos never very widely used never entered ordinary greek remained less exclusive property plato's subsequent admirers such aristotle philo judaeus plutarch albinus iamblichus ioannes philoponus
most important normal philosophical usage gnostikos never applied person whole mental endeavours facilities components personality
thus really true christians referred themselves gnostikoi professed gnostikoi porphyry celsus two pagans against christianity clement alexandria irenaeus claim then novel coinage very distinctive moniker opposed continuation traditional usage
further might well mark self-designating proper name rather merely self-description
indeed sounded like technical philosophical jargon time
contrast merely claiming supply gnosis common claim 2 nd century ce unworthy notice many christian hellenistic circles
historical relations neoplatonism gnosticism there four major epochs history platonic thought old academy new academy middle platonism neoplatonism
after plato's death 348 bc leadership academy taken up nephew speusippus then xenocrates polemon crantor crates athens leaders old academy
following crates 268 bc arcesilaus pitane founded new academy under influence pyrrhonian scepticism
arcelisaus modeled philosophy after socrates plato's early dialogues suspending judgment epoche epokhê peri pantôn ἐποχὴ περὶ πάντων
antiochus ascalon headed academy 79-78 bc sought intellectually maneuver around scepticism new academy way return dogmata plato old academy philosophers
antiochus argued platonic forms see platonic realism transcendent immanent rational minds including god
position along treatment platonic demiurge theaetetus world-soul notion timaeus physical world animated being framed work other middle platonists such philo alexandria later platonists such plutarch chaeronea numenius apamea albinus
these treatments forms demiurge crucially influential both neoplatonism gnosticism
neopythagoreanism seems influenced both neoplatonists gnostics well
further neopythagoreanism middle platonism seem important influences basilides hermetic tradition seem turn influenced valentinians
indeed nag hammadi texts included excerpts plato irenaeus claims followers carpocrates honored images pythagoras plato aristotle along images jesus christ
neoplatonism main article neoplatonism third century plotinus shifted platonist thought far enough modern scholars consider period new movement called neoplatonism—although plotinus took position conform old academics middle platonists especially via teacher ammonius saccas alexander aphrodisias later head lyceum athens numenius apamea forerunner neo-pythagoreans neo-platonists

gnosticism main article gnosticism scholarship gnosticism greatly advanced discovery translation nag hammadi texts shed light puzzling comments plotinus porphyry regarding gnostics
importantly texts help distinguish different kinds early gnostics
now seems clear sethian valentinian gnostics attempted effort towards conciliation even affiliation late antique philosophy rebuffed neoplatonists including plotinus
plotinus considered opponents heretics imbeciles blasphemers erroneously arriving misotheism solution problem evil taking their truths over plato
conflict idea expressed plotinus approach infinite force monad through knowing knowing
although there dispute gnostics plotinus referring appears sethian
earliest origins gnosticism still obscure disputed probably include influence plato middle platonism neo-pythagoreanism seems true both sethian gnostics valentinian gnostics
further compare different sethian texts each other attempted chronology development sethianism during first few centuries seems later texts continuing interact platonism
earlier texts such apocalypse adam show signs being pre-christian focus seth jewish bible egyptian god set sometimes called seth greek
these early sethians may identical related ophites sectarian group called minuth philo
later sethian texts such zostrianos allogenes draw imagery older sethian texts utilize large fund philosophical conceptuality derived contemporary platonism late middle platonism no traces christian content
indeed allogenes doctrine triple-powered same doctrine found anonymous parmenides commentary fragment ascribed hadot porphyry
also found plotinus' ennead 6

however 3 rd century neoplatonists such plotinus porphyry amelius attacking sethians
looks sethianism began pre-christian tradition possibly syncretic hebrew mediterranean baptismal movement jordan valley
babylonian egyptian pagan elements hellenic philosophy
incorporated elements christianity platonism grew both christianity platonism reject turn against
turner believes double attack led sethianism fragmentation numerous smaller groups audians borborites archontics perhaps phibionites stratiotici secundians
philosophical relations neoplatonism gnosticism gnostics borrow lot ideas terms platonism
exhibit keen understanding greek philosophical terms greek koine language general use greek philosophical concepts throughout their text including such concepts hypostasis reality existence ousia essence substance being demiurge creator god
good examples include texts such hypostasis archons reality rulers trimorphic protennoia first thought three forms
gnostics structured their world transcendent being ontological distinctions whereby plenitude divine world emerges sole high deity emanation radiation unfolding mental self-reflection
likewise technique self-performable contemplative mystical ascent towards beyond realm pure being rooted plato's symposium common gnostic thought also expressed plotinus see life plotinus
divine triads tetrads ogdoads gnostic thought often closely related neo-pythagorean arithmology
trinity triple-powered powers consisting modalities existence life mind allogenes mirrors quite closely neoplatonic doctrine intellect differentiating itself three phases called existence reality hypostasis life intellect nous
both traditions heavily emphasize role negative theology apophasis gnostic emphasis ineffability god often echoes platonic neoplatonic formulations ineffability good
there important philosophical differences
gnostics emphasized magic ritual way disagreeable sober neoplatonists such plotinus porphyry though perhaps later neoplatonists such iamblichus
plotinus' main objection gnostic teachings encountered their rejection goodness demiurge material world
attacked gnostics their vilification plato's ontology universe contained timaeus
plotinus accused gnosticism vilifying demiurge craftsman shaped material world ultimately perceiving material world evil prison
plotinus set forth demiurge nous emanation ordering principle mind also reason
plotinus critical gnostic derivation demiurge wisdom sophia anthropomorphic personification wisdom feminine spirit deity unlike goddess athena christian holy spirit
these objections seem applicable nag hammadi texts although others such valentinians tripartite tractate appear insist goodness world demiurge
plotinus indicated gnostics really believed world prison then might any moment free themselves committing suicide
first international conference neoplatonism gnosticism first international conference neoplatonism gnosticism university oklahoma 1984 explored relationship neoplatonism gnosticism
conference also led book named neoplatonism gnosticism
book's intent document creation conference academic world exploring relationship late middle platonic philosophy gnosticism
book marked turning point discussion subject neoplatonism because took account understanding gnostics plotinus' day light discovery nag hammadi library
further discussions topics covered book led formation new committee scholars once again translate plotinus' enneads
both richard wallis

conference held cover controversies surrounding these issues other aspects two groups
objective event book documents event clarify relationship neoplatonism / neoplatonists sectarian groups day gnostics
book republished works wide spectrum scholars field philosophy
book's content consisted presentations experts delivered first international conference
purpose clarify meaning words phrases repeated other religions belief systems mediterranean region during plotinus' time
another try clarify extent plotinus' work followed directly plato how much influence plotinus religions time vice versa
conference book documenting considered key avenue dialogue among different scholars history philosophy
later conferences studies john
