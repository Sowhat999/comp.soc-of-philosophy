work lyotard's work characterised persistent opposition universals meta-narratives generality
fiercely critical many 'universalist' claims enlightenment several works serve undermine fundamental principles generate these broad claims
writings early 1970 s rejects regards theological underpinnings both karl marx sigmund freud freud judaical critical sombre forgetful political marx catholic
hegelian reconciliatory
other relationship economic meaning blocked category representation
here politics there therapeutics both cases laical theology top arbitrariness roaming forces
consequently rejected theodor w
adorno's negative dialectics because viewed them seeking therapeutic resolution framework religion here religion history
lyotard's libidinal economics aimed discovering describing different social modes investment libidinal intensities
postmodern condition lyotard skeptic modern cultural thought
impact postmodern condition provoke skepticism universalizing theories
lyotard argues outgrown our needs grand narratives due advancement techniques technologies since wwii
argues against possibility justifying narratives bring together disciplines social practices such science culture narratives tell justify single set laws stakes inherently unjust
loss faith meta-narratives effect how view science art literature
little narratives now become appropriate way explaining social transformations political problems
lyotard argues driving force behind postmodern science
metanarratives fade science suffers loss faith search truth therefore must find other ways legitimating efforts
connected scientific legitimacy growing dominance information machines
lyotard argues day order knowledge considered useful will converted computerized data
years later led writing book inhuman published 1988 illustrates world technology taken over
collapse grand narrative language-games most famously condition postmoderne rapport sur le savoir postmodern condition report knowledge 1979 proposes calls extreme simplification postmodern 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'
these meta-narratives—sometimes 'grand narratives'—are grand large-scale theories philosophies world such progress history knowability everything science possibility absolute freedom
lyotard argues ceased believe narratives kind adequate represent contain us
points out no seemed agree anything real everyone their own perspective story
become alert difference diversity incompatibility our aspirations beliefs desires reason postmodernity characterised abundance micronarratives
concept lyotard draws notion 'language-games' found work ludwig wittgenstein
lyotard notes based mapping society according concept language games
lyotard's works term 'language games' sometimes also called 'phrase regimens' denotes multiplicity communities meaning innumerable incommensurable separate systems meanings produced rules their circulation created
involves example incredulity towards metanarrative human emancipation
story how human race set itself free brings together language game science language game human historical conflicts language game human qualities overall justification steady development human race terms wealth moral well-being
according metanarrative justification science related wealth education
development history seen steady progress towards civilization moral well-being
language game human passions qualities faults seen steadily shifting favor our qualities away our faults science historical developments help us conquer our faults favor our qualities
point any event ought able understood terms justifications metanarrative anything happens understood judged according discourse human emancipation
example any new social political scientific revolution ask question “is revolution step towards greater well-being mass human beings?” should possible answer question terms rules justification metanarrative human emancipation
becomes crucial au juste conversations just gaming 1979 le différend differend 1983 develop postmodern theory justice
might appear atomisation human beings implied notion micronarrative language game suggests collapse ethics
often thought universality condition something properly ethical statement 'thou shalt steal' ethical statement way 'thou shalt steal margaret'
latter too particular ethical statement what's special margaret? ethical rests universal statement 'thou shalt steal anyone'
universals impermissible world lost faith metanarratives seem ethics impossible
justice injustice terms within language games universality ethics out window
lyotard argues notions justice injustice fact remain postmodernism
new definition injustice indeed use language rules 'phrase regimen' apply them another
ethical behaviour remaining alert precisely threat injustice paying attention things their particularity enclosing them within abstract conceptuality
must bear witness 'differend
differend there conflict two parties cannot solved just manner
however act being able bridge two understand claims both parties first step towards finding solution
like call differend case plaintiff divested means argue becomes reason victim
addressor addressee sense testimony neutralized everything takes place there no damages
case differend two parties takes place regulation conflict opposes them done idiom parties while wrong suffered other signified idiom
differend differend based immanuel kant's views separation understanding judgment reason lyotard identifies moment language fails differend explains follows
unstable state instant language wherein something must able put phrases cannot yet be… human beings thought use language instrument communication learn through feeling pain accompanies silence pleasure accompanies invention new idiom
lyotard undermines common view meanings phrases determined refer referent
meaning phrase—an event something happens--cannot fixed appealing reality actually happened
lyotard develops view language defining “reality” original way complex possible senses attached referent through name
correct sense phrase cannot determined reference reality since referent itself does fix sense reality itself defined complex competing senses attached referent
therefore phrase event remains indeterminate
lyotard uses example auschwitz revisionist historian faurisson’s demands proof holocaust show how differend operates double bind dilemma difficult circumstance there no escape because mutually conflicting dependent conditions
faurisson will accept proof existence gas chambers eyewitnesses themselves victims gas chambers
however any such eyewitnesses dead able testify
either there no gas chambers case there no eyewitnesses produce evidence there gas chambers case there still no eyewitnesses produce evidence because dead
since faurisson will accept no evidence existence gas chambers except testimony actual victims will conclude both possibilities gas chambers existed gas chambers exist gas chambers exist
presents double bind
there two alternatives either there gas chambers there lead same conclusion there no gas chambers no final solution
case differend because harm done victims cannot presented standard judgement upheld faurisson
sublime lyotard frequent writer aesthetic matters
despite reputation postmodernist great promoter modernist art
lyotard saw postmodernism latent tendency within thought throughout time narrowly limited historical period
favoured startling perplexing works high modernist avant-garde
them found demonstration limits our conceptuality valuable lesson anyone too imbued enlightenment confidence
lyotard written extensively also few contemporary artists choice valerio adami daniel buren marcel duchamp bracha ettinger barnett newman well paul cézanne wassily kandinsky
developed these themes particular discussing sublime
sublime term aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after century neglect
refers experience pleasurable anxiety experience confronting wild threatening sights like example massive craggy mountain black against sky looming terrifyingly our vision
sublime conjunction two opposed feelings makes harder us see injustice solution
lyotard found particularly interesting explanation sublime offered immanuel kant critique judgment sometimes critique power judgment
book kant explains mixture anxiety pleasure following terms there two kinds 'sublime' experience
'mathematically' sublime object strikes mind such way find ourselves unable take whole
precisely experience clash our reason tells us objects finite imagination aspect mind organizes see sees object incalculably larger ourselves feels infinite
'dynamically' sublime mind recoils object immeasurably powerful whose weight force scale crush us without remotest hope our being able resist
kant stresses actual danger our feeling anxiety very different sublime feeling
sublime aesthetic experience practical feeling personal danger
explains feeling anxiety
deeply unsettling mathematically sublime mental faculties present visual perceptions mind inadequate concept corresponding other words able make ourselves see cannot fully match up know there
know it's mountain cannot take whole thing our perception
our sensibility incapable coping such sights our reason assert finitude presentation
[citation needed] dynamically sublime our sense physical danger should prompt awareness just physical material beings moral kant's terms noumenal beings well
body may dwarfed power our reason need
explains both cases why sublime experience pleasure well pain
lyotard fascinated admission philosophical architects enlightenment mind cannot organise world rationally
objects simply incapable being brought neatly under concepts
lyotard lessons analytic sublime drawing argument differend good thing
such generalities 'concepts' fail pay proper attention particularity things
happens sublime crisis realise inadequacy imagination reason each other
witnessing says lyotard actually differend straining mind edges itself edges conceptuality
libidinal economy lyotard's most famous books libidinal economy offers critique marx’s “false consciousness” claims 19 th century working class enjoyed being part industrialization process
lyotard claims due libidinal energy
term libidinal coming term libido used refer psychoanalytical desires our deeper consciousness
lyotard’s writings libidinal economy achievement our attempts live rejection religious moral principles through undermining structures associated
structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings desires force us away set structures
however there also no intensities desires without structures because there no dream escaping repressive structures exist
“libidinal energy comes disruptive intervention external events within structures seek order self-containment
first lyotard's writings really criticized marxist view
achieved great success also last lyotard's writings particular topic really went against views karl marx
later life death latest works lyotard working both writings french writer activist politician andre malraux
them being signed malraux autobiography andre malraux
lyotard interested aesthetic views society malraux shared
lyotard's other book named confession augustine study phenomenology time
work-in-progress published posthumously same year lyotard's death
lyotard repeatedly returned notion postmodern essays gathered english postmodern explained children toward postmodern postmodern fables
1998 while preparing conference postmodernism media theory died unexpectedly case leukemia advanced rapidly
buried le père lachaise cemetery paris
criticism there three major criticisms lyotard's work
each coincides school thought
jaques derrida jean-luc nancy written deconstructions lyotard's work derrida 1992 nancy 1985
focus lyotard's postmodern work differend particular
differend depends upon distinction drawn groups itself depends upon heterogeneity language games genres discourse
why should these differences privileged over endless division reconstruction groups? concentrating specific differences lyotard's thought becomes overly dependent differences categories given fixed well defined
point view deconstruction lyotard's philosophy gives too much credit illegitimate categories groups
underlying any different there multiplicity further differences these will involve crossing first divide others will question integrity groups originally separated
manfred frank 1988 put frankfurt school criticism best
attacks lyotard's search division over consensus grounds involves philosophical mistake serious political social repercussions
lyotard failed notice underlying condition consensus also condition successful communication own thought
performance contradiction give account appeals our reason behalf difference supposed elude
putting forward false argument against rational consensus lyotard plays hands irrational forces often give rise injustice differ ends
worse then position testify injustice rather put forward just rational resolution
nietzschean deleuzian point view james williams 2000 lyotard's postmodern philosophy took turn toward destructive modern nihilism early work avoids
different sublime negative terms introduce severe pessimism core lyotard's philosophy
both terms draw lines cannot crossed yet mark threshold most valuable philosophy testified proper concern
possible repetitively lend ear sublime without falling despair due fleeting nature
whenever try understand even memorize activity testimony through sublime something now dissipated cannot capture
