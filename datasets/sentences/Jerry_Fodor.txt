holds position state new jersey professor philosophy emeritus rutgers university author many works fields philosophy mind cognitive science laid groundwork modularity mind language thought hypotheses among other ideas
known provocative sometimes polemical style argumentation principal philosophers mind late twentieth early twenty-first century
addition having exerted enormous influence virtually every portion philosophy mind literature since 1960 fodor’s work significant impact development cognitive sciences
fodor argues mental states such beliefs desires relations individuals mental representations
maintains these representations correctly explained terms language thought lot mind
furthermore language thought itself actually existing thing codified brain just useful explanatory tool
fodor adheres species functionalism maintaining thinking other mental processes consist primarily computations operating syntax representations make up language thought
fodor significant parts mind such perceptual linguistic processes structured terms modules organs defines their causal functional roles
these modules relatively independent each other central processing part mind global less domain specific character
fodor suggests character these modules permits possibility causal relations external objects
turn makes possible mental states contents things world
central processing part other hand takes care logical relations various contents inputs outputs
although fodor originally rejected idea mental states must causal externally determined aspect recent years devoted much writing study philosophy language because problem meaning reference mental contents
contributions area include so-called asymmetric causal theory reference many arguments against semantic holism
fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts mind
argues mental states multiply realizable there hierarchy explanatory levels science such generalizations laws higher-level theory psychology linguistics example cannot captured low-level explanations behavior neurons synapses

fodor nature mental states main article jerry fodor mental states article propositional attitudes 1978 fodor introduced idea mental states relations individuals mental representations
despite changes many positions over years idea intentional attitudes relational remained unchanged original formulation up present time[update]
article attempted show how mental representations specifically sentences language thought necessary explain relational nature mental states
fodor considers two alternative hypotheses
first completely denies relational character mental states second considers mental states two-place relations
latter position further subdivided carnapian view such relations individuals sentences natural languages fregean view individuals propositions expressed such sentences
fodor's own position instead properly account nature intentional attitudes necessary employ three-place relation individuals representations propositional contents
considering mental states three-place relations way representative realism makes possible hold together elements necessary solution problem
further mental representations objects beliefs desires also domain over mental processes operate
considered ideal link syntactic notion mental content computational notion functional architecture
these notions according fodor our best explanation mental processes
functional architecture mind ideas modularity mind predecessors 19 th-century movement phrenology founded franz joseph gall
main article jerry fodor mental architecture following path paved linguist noam chomsky fodor developed strong commitment idea psychological nativism
nativism postulates innateness many cognitive functions concepts
fodor position emerges naturally out criticism behaviourism associationism
these criticisms also led formulation hypothesis modularity mind
historically questions mental architecture divided[by whom?] two contrasting theories nature faculties
first described horizontal view because sees mental processes interactions faculties domain specific
example judgment remains judgment whether judgment perceptual experience judgment understanding language
second described vertical view because claims our mental faculties domain specific genetically determined associated distinct neurological structures
vertical vision traced back 19 th century movement called phrenology founder franz joseph gall
gall claimed mental faculties associated[by whom?] specific physical areas brain
hence someone's level intelligence example literally read off size particular bump posterior parietal lobe
simplistic view modularity disproved over course last century
fodor revived idea modularity without notion precise physical localizability 1980 s became most vocal proponents 1983 publication monograph modularity mind
two properties modularity particular informational encapsulation domain specificity make possible tie together questions functional architecture those mental content
ability elaborate information independently background beliefs individuals these two properties allow fodor give atomistic causal account notion mental content
main idea other words properties contents mental states depend rather exclusively internal relations system part also their causal relations external world
fodor's notions mental modularity informational encapsulation domain specificity taken up expanded much fodor's chagrin cognitive scientists such zenon pylyshyn evolutionary psychologists such steven pinker henry plotkin among many others
fodor complains pinker plotkin other members sarcastically calls new synthesis taken modularity similar ideas way too far
insists mind massively modular contrary these researchers us believe mind still very long way having explained computational any other model
intentional realism theory content other essays 1990 fodor takes up another central notions question reality mental representations
fodor needs justify representational realism justify idea contents mental states expressed symbolic structures such those lot
fodor's criticism dennett fodor starts criticisms so-called standard realism
view characterized according fodor two distinct assertions
these regards internal structure mental states asserts such states non-relational
other concerns semantic theory mental content asserts there isomorphism causal roles such contents inferential web beliefs
among modern philosophers mind majority view seems first these two assertions false second true
fodor departs view accepting truth first thesis rejecting strongly truth second
particular fodor criticizes instrumentalism daniel dennett
dennett maintains possible realist regard intentional states without having commit oneself reality mental representations
now according fodor remains level analysis then there no possibility explaining why intentional strategy works there
standard objection instrumentalism
difficult explain why psychology beliefs/desires works well psychology beliefs/desires fact false
putnam boyd others emphasized predictive successes theory truth theory there surely presumed inference even likely
dealing theory play predictively crowned success
why such presumption should militate favour realist conception
interpretations beliefs/desires
productivity systematicity thought fodor also positive arguments favour reality mental representations terms lot
maintains language expression thoughts language systematic then thoughts must also systematic
fodor draws work noam chomsky both model theory mind refute alternative architectures such connectionism
systematicity natural languages explained chomsky terms two basic concepts productivity compositionality
productivity refers representational system's unbounded ability generate new representations given set symbols
john loves mary allow construction sentences john loves mary mary loves john
fodor's language thought theorizes representations decomposable constituent parts these decomposed representations built new strings
important productivity systematicity since does rely questionable idealizations human cognition
argument states cognizer able understand sentence virtue understanding another
example no understands john loves mary unable understand mary loves john no understands p q unable understand p
systematicity itself rarely challenged property natural languages logics challenge thought systematic same way languages
still others connectionist tradition tried build non-classical networks account apparent systematicity language
fact systematicity productivity depend compositional structure language means language combinatorial semantics
thought also such combinatorial semantics then there must language thought
second argument fodor provides favour representational realism involves processes thought
argument touches relation representational theory mind models architecture
sentences mentalese require unique processes elaboration then require computational mechanism certain type
syntactic notion mental representations goes hand hand idea mental processes calculations act form symbols elaborate
computational theory mind
consequently defence model architecture based classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through defence reality mental representations
fodor formal notion thought processes also advantage highlighting parallels causal role symbols contents express
view syntax plays role mediation causal role symbols their contents
semantic relations symbols imitated their syntactic relations
inferential relations connect contents two symbols imitated formal syntax rules regulate derivation symbol another
nature content beginning 1980 s fodor adhered causal notion mental content meaning
idea content contrasts sharply inferential role semantics subscribed earlier career
2010[update] fodor criticizes inferential role semantics irs because commitment extreme form holism excludes possibility true naturalization mental
naturalization must include explanation content atomistic causal terms
anti-holism fodor made many varied criticisms holism
identifies central problem different notions holism idea determining factor semantic evaluation notion epistemic bond
briefly p epistemic bond q meaning p considered someone relevant determination meaning q
meaning holism strongly depends notion
identity content mental state under holism determined totality epistemic bonds
makes realism mental states impossibility people differ absolutely general way their estimations epistemic relevance follow holism meaning individuate intentional states way totality their epistemic bonds consequence will two people matter two temporal sections same person will never same intentional state
therefore two people never subsumed under same intentional generalizations
therefore intentional generalization never successful
therefore again there no hope intentional psychology
asymmetric causal theory having criticized idea semantic evaluation concerns internal relations units symbolic system fodor adopt externalist position respect mental content meaning
fodor recent years problem naturalization mental tied possibility giving sufficient conditions piece world relative expresses represents true another piece non-intentional non-semantic terms
goal achieved within representational theory mind then challenge devise causal theory establish interpretation primitive non-logical symbols lot
fodor's initial proposal determines symbol water mentalese expresses property h2 o occurrences symbol certain causal relations water
intuitive version causal theory fodor calls crude causal theory
according theory occurrences symbols express properties causes their occurrence
term horse example says horse horse
order necessary sufficient certain properties occurrence symbol horse law-like relation certain properties determine something occurrence horse
main problem theory erroneous representations
there two unavoidable problems idea symbol expresses property
necessary presences such property cause occurrences
first horses cause occurrences horse
second horses cause occurrences horse
sometimes ahorses caused horses other times—when example because distance conditions low visibility confused cow horse—the horses caused cows
case symbol doesn’t express just property disjunction properties
crude causal theory therefore incapable distinguishing case content symbol disjunctive case isn’t
gives rise fodor calls problem disjunction
fodor responds problem defines slightly less crude causal theory
according approach necessary break symmetry base crude causal theory
fodor must find criterion distinguishing occurrences caused true those caused bs false
point departure according fodor while false cases ontologically dependent true cases reverse true
there asymmetry dependence other words true contents a= false ones =
first subsist independently second second occur because existence first point view semantics errors must accidents extension horse there no cows then cannot required meaning horse cows called horses
other hand horse mean means error horses never possible cow called horse
putting two things together seen possibility falsely saying horse presupposes existence semantic basis saying truly vice versa
put terms crude causal theory fact cows cause say horse depends fact horses cause say horse fact horses cause say horse does depend fact cows cause say horse
functionalism during 1960 s various philosophers such donald davidson hilary putnam fodor tried resolve puzzle developing way preserve explanatory efficacy mental causation so-called folk psychology while adhering materialist vision world violate generality physics
their proposal first reject then-dominant theories philosophy mind behaviorism type identity theory
problem logical behaviorism failed account causation mental states such causation seems essential psychological explanation especially considers behavior effect single mental event/cause rather effect chain mental events/causes
type-identity theory other hand failed explain fact radically different physical systems find themselves identical mental state
besides being deeply anthropocentric why should humans thinking organisms universe? identity-type theory also failed deal accumulating evidence neurosciences every single human brain different others
hence impossibility referring common mental states different physical systems manifests itself different species also organisms same species
illustration multiple realizability
m stands mental p stand physical
diagram shows p instantiate m vice versa
causal relations states represented arrows m1 goes m2 etc
solve these problems according fodor functionalism hypothesis designed overcome failings both dualism reductionism
important function mental state regardless physical substrate implements
foundation view lies principle multiple realizability mental
under view example computer both instantiate realize same functional state though made completely different material stuff see graphic right
basis functionalism classified form token materialism
evolution fodor co-written book biolinguist massimo piattelli-palmarini called darwin got wrong 2010 describes neo-darwinists being distressingly uncritical says darwin's theory evolution overestimates contribution environment makes shaping phenotype species correspondingly underestimates effects endogenous variables
evolutionary biologist jerry coyne describes book profoundly misguided critique natural selection biologically uninformed strident
moral philosopher anti-scientism author mary midgley praises darwin got wrong overdue valuable onslaught neo-darwinist simplicities book also received positive review mathematician intelligent design theorist william dembski
criticism wide variety philosophers diverse orientations challenged many fodor's ideas
example language thought hypothesis accused either falling prey infinite regress being superfluous
specifically simon blackburn suggested article 1984 since fodor explains learning natural languages process formation confirmation hypotheses lot leaves open question why lot itself should considered just such language requires yet another fundamental representational substrate form confirm hypotheses lot itself learned
natural language learning requires representational substrate lot order learned why shouldn't same lot itself then representational substrate representational substrate ad infinitum? other hand such representational substrate required lot then why should required learning natural languages? case lot superfluous
fodor response argues lot unique does learned via antecedent language because innate
1981 daniel dennett formulated another argument against lot
dennett suggested seem basis evidence our behavior toward computers also regard our own unconscious behavior explicit representation necessary explanation propositional attitudes
during game chess computer program often attribute such attitudes computer saying such things thinks queen should moved left
attribute propositional attitudes computer helps us explain predict behavior various contexts
yet no suggest computer actually thinking believing somewhere inside circuits equivalent propositional attitude believe kick guy's butt mentalese
same obviously true suggests dennett many our everyday automatic behaviors such desiring breathe clear air stuffy environment
linguists philosophers language criticized fodor's self-proclaimed extreme concept nativism
kent bach example takes fodor task criticisms lexical semantics polysemy
fodor claims there no lexical structure such verbs keep get make put
suggests alternatively keep simply expresses concept keep fodor capitalizes concepts distinguish them properties names other such entities
there straightforward one-to-one mapping individual words concepts keep your clothes keep your receipt keep washing your hands will share same concept keep under fodor's theory
concept presumably locks unique external property keeping
true then retain must pick out different property retain your receipt since can't retain one's clothes retain washing one's hands
fodor's theory also problem explaining how concept fast contributes differently contents fast car fast driver fast track fast time
whether differing interpretations fast these sentences specified semantics english result pragmatic inference matter debate
fodor's own response kind criticism expressed bluntly concepts people sometimes used say exist must ambiguous because look difference 'chairs exist' 'numbers exist'
familiar reply goes difference existence chairs existence numbers seems reflection strikingly like difference numbers chairs
since you latter explain former you don't also need 'exist' polysemic
critics find difficult accept fodor's insistence large perhaps implausible number concepts primitive undefinable
example fodor considers such concepts effect island trapezoid week primitive innate unanalyzable because fall category calls lexical concepts those our language single word
against view bach argues concept vixen almost certainly composed out concepts female fox bachelor out single male
