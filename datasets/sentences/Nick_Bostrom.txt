philosophy existential risk important aspect bostrom's research concerns future humanity long-term outcomes
introduced concept existential risk defines adverse outcome either annihilate earth-originating intelligent life permanently drastically curtail potential
2008 volume global catastrophic risks editors bostrom milan ćirković characterize relation existential risk broader class global catastrophic risks link existential risk observer selection effects fermi paradox
2013 paper journal global policy bostrom offers taxonomy existential risk proposes reconceptualization sustainability dynamic terms developmental trajectory minimizes existential risk
philosopher derek parfit argued importance ensuring survival humanity due value potentially large number future generations
similarly bostrom consequentialist perspective even small reductions cumulative amount existential risk humanity will face extremely valuable point traditional utilitarian imperative—to maximize expected utility—can simplified maxipok principle maximize probability ok outcome ok outcome any avoids existential catastrophe
2005 bostrom founded future humanity institute researches far future human civilization
also adviser centre study existential risk
superintelligence 2014 book superintelligence paths dangers strategies bostrom reasons cognitive performance greatly [exceeding] humans virtually domains interest superintelligent agents promise substantial societal benefits pose significant artificial intelligence ai-related existential risk
therefore crucial says approach area caution take active steps mitigate risks face
january 2015 bostrom joined stephen hawking max tegmark elon musk martin rees jaan tallinn among others signing future life institute's open letter warning potential dangers ai
believe research how make ai systems robust beneficial both important timely there concrete research directions pursued today
anthropic reasoning bostrom published numerous articles anthropic reasoning well book anthropic bias observation selection effects science philosophy
book criticizes previous formulations anthropic principle including those brandon carter john leslie john barrow frank tipler
bostrom believes mishandling indexical information common flaw many areas inquiry including cosmology philosophy evolution theory game theory quantum physics
argues theory anthropics needed deal these
introduced self-sampling assumption ssa self-indication assumption sia showed how lead different conclusions number cases
pointed out each affected paradoxes counterintuitive implications certain thought experiments ssa e
doomsday argument sia presumptuous philosopher thought experiment
suggested way forward may involve extending ssa strong self-sampling assumption sssa replaces observers ssa definition observer-moments
allow reference class relativized derived expression observation equation
later work described phenomenon anthropic shadow observation selection effect prevents observers observing certain kinds catastrophes their recent geological evolutionary past
catastrophe types lie anthropic shadow likely underestimated unless statistical corrections made
ethics human enhancement bostrom favorable towards human enhancement self-improvement human perfectibility through ethical application science well critic bio-conservative views
philosopher toby ord proposed reversal test
given humans' irrational status quo bias how distinguish valid criticisms proposed changes human trait criticisms merely motivated resistance change? reversal test attempts asking whether good thing trait altered opposite direction
1998 bostrom co-founded david pearce world transhumanist association since changed name humanity+
2004 co-founded james hughes institute ethics emerging technologies although no longer involved either these organisations
bostrom named foreign policy's 2009 list top global thinkers accepting no limits human potential
technology strategy suggested technology policy aimed reducing existential risk should seek influence order various technological capabilities attained proposing principle differential technological development
principle states ought retard development dangerous technologies particularly ones raise level existential risk accelerate development beneficial technologies particularly those protect against existential risks posed nature other technologies
