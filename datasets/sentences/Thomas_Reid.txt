thought epistemology introductory part practical ethics confirmed our common beliefs philosophy act according them because know right
moral philosophy reminiscent roman stoicism emphasis agency subject self-control
often quotes cicero whom adopted term sensus communis
reid's answer hume's sceptical naturalist arguments enumerate set principles common sense sensus communis constitute foundations rational thought
anyone undertakes philosophical argument example must implicitly presuppose certain beliefs like am talking real person there external world whose laws change among many other positive substantive claims
reid belief truth these principles rational rather reason itself demands these principles prerequisites does innate constitution human mind
reason possibly mocking attitude toward hume berkeley reid sees belief principles common sense litmus test sanity
example intellectual powers man states before men reason together must agree first principles impossible reason man no principles common you
first principles goes list qualities must necessarily something figured coloured hard soft moves resists
these qualities subject them give name body
any man should think fit deny these things qualities require any subject leave enjoy opinion man denies first principles fit reasoned
reid also made positive arguments based phenomenological insight put forth novel mixture direct realism ordinary language philosophy
typical passage intellectual powers asserts conception centaur thing conceives animal no idea animal therefore thing conceives idea centaur
point relies both account subjective experience conceiving object also account mean use words
because reid saw philosophy publicly accessible knowledge available both through introspection proper understanding how language used saw philosophy common sense
exploring sense language reid started out 'common sense' based direct experience external reality then proceeded explore two directions - external senses internal human language - find rational basis
case latter reid saw based innate capacity pre-dating human consciousness acting instrument consciousness
also language then becomes means examining original form human cognition
reid notes current human language contains two distinct elements first acoustic element secondly meanings seem nothing sounds such
state language calls 'artificial' cannot primeval terms 'natural' wherein sound abstract sign concrete gesture natural sign
reid looks way child learns language imitating sounds becoming aware them long before understands meaning accorded various groups sounds artificial state contemporary adult speech
says reid child understand immediately conceptual content words hears never learn speak
here reid distinguishes natural artificial signs
'it natural signs chiefly give force energy language less language them less expressive persuasive
artificial signs signify express speak intellect algebraic characters may passions affections will hear them these continue dormant inactive till speak them language nature attention obedience
52 regards former reid led critical distinction 'sensation' 'perception'
while become aware object through senses content perception identical sum total sensations caused our consciousness
thus while tend focus object perceived pay no attention process leading sensation perception contains knowledge thing real
how then receive conviction latter's existence? reid's answer entering immediate intuitive relationship child does
case adult focus perceiving child receiving sensations their living nature
reid perception child different adult states man must become like child get past artificial perception adult leads hume's view perceive illusion
also artist provides key true content sense experience engages 'language nature'
'it easy show fine arts musician painter actor orator far expressive
nothing else language nature brought world us unlearned disuse find greatest difficulty recovering
53 without natural knowledge connection these [natural] signs things signified them language never invented established among men fine arts founded upon connection may call natural language mankind
59 thus reid common sense based innate capacity man earlier epoch directly participate nature find extent child artist philosophical scientific perspective must re-awaken higher level human mind above nature
reid also claimed discovery link natural sign thing signified basis natural philosophy science pointed out bacon new method discovery innate laws nature
great lord verulam perfect comprehension called interpretation nature
no man ever distinctly understood happily expressed nature foundation philosophic art
know mechanics astronomy optics connections established nature discovered experience observation consequences deduced them? …what commonly call natural causes might propriety called natural signs call effects things signified…[as]all certainly affirm nature hath established constant conjunction them things called their effects
