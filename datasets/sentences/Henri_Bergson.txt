3 january 1941 bergson died occupied paris bronchitis
roman catholic priest prayers funeral per request
bergson buried cimetière de garches hauts-de-seine
philosophy bergson rejected saw overly mechanistic predominant view causality expressed say finalism
argued must allow space free will unfold autonomous unpredictable fashion
while kant saw free will something beyond time space therefore ultimately matter faith bergson attempted redefine modern conceptions time space causality concept duration making room tangible marriage free will causality
seeing duration mobile fluid concept bergson argued cannot understand duration through immobile analysis through experiential first-person intuition
creativity bergson considers appearance novelty result pure undetermined creation instead predetermined result mechanistic forces
philosophy emphasises pure mobility unforeseeable novelty creativity freedom thus characterize system process philosophy
touches upon such topics time identity free will perception change memory consciousness language foundation mathematics limits reason
criticizing kant's theory knowledge exposed critique pure reason conception truth — compares plato's conception truth symmetrical inversion order nature/order thought — bergson attempted redefine relations science metaphysics intelligence intuition insisted necessity increasing thought's possibility through use intuition according alone approached knowledge absolute real life understood pure duration
because relative criticism intelligence makes frequent use images metaphors writings order avoid use concepts considers fail touch whole reality being sort abstract net thrown things
instance says creative evolution chap
iii thought itself never thought possible human being swim cannot deduce swimming walking
swimming possible man must throw itself water then thought consider swimming possible
intelligence bergson practical faculty rather pure speculative faculty product evolution used man survive
metaphysics avoid false problems should extend pure speculation abstract concepts intelligence rather use intuition
creative evolution particular attempted think through continuous creation life explicitly pitted itself against herbert spencer's evolutionary philosophy
spencer attempted transpose charles darwin's theory evolution philosophy construct cosmology based theory spencer also coined expression survival fittest
bergson disputed saw spencer's mechanistic philosophy
henri bergson’s lebensphilosophie philosophy life seen response mechanistic philosophies time also failure finalism
indeed considers finalism unable explain duration continuous creation life explains life progressive development initially determined program — notion remains example expression genetic program such description finalism adopted instance leibniz
clearly announces alfred north whitehead's
bergson regarded planning beforehand future impossible since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities
indeed explain historical event retrospectively conditions possibility
introduction pensée et le mouvant explains such event created retrospectively causes taking example creation work art example symphony impossible predict symphony future musician knew symphony best time realize
words effect created cause
henceforth attempted find third way mechanism finalism through notion original impulse élan vital life dispersed itself through evolution contradictory tendencies substituted finalist notion teleological aim notion original impulse
duration see also duration philosophy foundation henri bergson’s philosophy theory duration discovered trying improve inadequacies herbert spencer’s philosophy
bergson introduced duration theory time consciousness doctoral thesis time free will essay immediate data consciousness response another influences immanuel kant
kant believed free will exist outside time space therefore know whether exists nothing pragmatic faith
bergson responded kant along many other philosophers confused time spatial representation
reality bergson argued duration unextended yet heterogeneous parts cannot juxtaposed succession distinct parts causing other
based concluded determinism impossibility free will pure mobility bergson identified being duration
intuition see also intuition bergson duration defined bergson then unity multiplicity being mobile cannot grasped through immobile concepts
bergson hence argues grasp through method intuition
two images henri bergson’s introduction metaphysics may help grasp bergson's term intuition limits concepts ability intuition grasp absolute
first image city
analysis creation concepts through divisions points view ever give us model city through construction photographs taken every possible point view yet never give us dimensional value walking city itself
grasp through intuition likewise experience reading line homer
may translate line pile commentary upon commentary commentary too shall never grasp simple dimensional value experiencing poem originality itself
method intuition then getting back things themselves
élan vital see also élan vital élan vital ranks bergson's third essential concept after duration intuition
idea goal explaining evolution élan vital first appeared 1907’s creative evolution
bergson portrays élan vital kind vital impetus explains evolution less mechanical lively manner well accounting creative impulse mankind
concept led several authors characterize bergson supporter vitalism—although criticized explicitly creative evolution thought against driesch johannes reinke whom cited there neither purely internal finality nor clearly cut individuality nature hereby lies stumbling block vitalist theories
thus vain pretends reduce finality individuality living being
there finality world life encompasses whole life indivisible embrace
laughter laughter essay meaning comic bergson develops theory laughter itself how laughter provoked see objection delage published 23 rd edition essay
describes process laughter refusing give conceptual definition approach reality used particular comics clowns caricature mechanism nature humans habits automatic acts etc
two tendencies life degradation towards inert matter mechanism continual creation new forms
however bergson warns us laughter’s criterion should laughed moral criterion fact cause serious damage person’s self-esteem
essay made opposition cartesian theory animal-machine obvious
reception first publications bergson's philosophy attracted strong criticism different quarters although also became very popular durably influenced french philosophy
mathematician édouard le roy became bergson's main disciple
nonetheless suzanne guerlac argued institutional position collège de france delivering lectures general audience may retarded systematic reception thought bergson achieved enormous popular success context often due emotional appeal ideas
equivalent graduate students might become rigorous interpreters thought
thus bergson's philosophy—in principle open nonsystematic—was easily borrowed piecemeal altered enthusiastic admirers
alfred north whitehead acknowledged bergson's influence process philosophy 1929 process reality
however bertrand russell whitehead's collaborator principia mathematica entranced bergson's philosophy
although acknowledging bergson's literary skills russell saw bergson's arguments best persuasive emotive speculation any worthwhile example sound reasoning philosophical insight
epistemologist gaston bachelard explicitly alluded last pages 1938 book formation scientific mind
others influenced bergson include vladimir jankélévitch book 1931 pierre teilhard de chardin gilles deleuze le bergsonisme 1966
bergson also influenced phenomenology maurice merleau-ponty emmanuel lévinas although merleau-ponty reservations bergson's philosophy
greek author nikos kazantzakis studied under bergson paris writing philosophy profoundly influenced result

according henri hude 1990 ii p
142 supports himself whole bergson's works well now published courses accusing pantheism counter-sense
hude alleges mystical experience roughly outlined end les deux sources de morale et de religion inner principle whole philosophy although contested other commentators
charles sanders peirce took strong exception those associated bergson
response letter comparing work bergson “a man seeks further science hardly commit greater sin use terms science without anxious care use them strict accuracy very gratifying my feelings classed along bergson seems doing utmost muddle distinctions
william james’s students resisted assimilation work bergson
see example horace kallen’s book subject james bergson
jean wahl described “ultimate disagreement” james bergson system metaphysics “for james consideration action necessary definition truth according bergson action
must kept our mind want see truth”[page needed]
gide even went far say future historians will overestimate bergson’s influence art philosophy just because self-appointed spokesman “the spirit age”
early 1890 s santayana attacked certain key concepts bergson’s philosophy above view new indeterminate possibility new unaccountable fact appearing any time” writes book hermann lotze “does practically affect method investigation
thing given up hope these hypotheses may ever adequate reality cover process nature without leaving remainder
no great renunciation consummation science
no really expected
according santayana russell bergson projected false claims onto aspirations scientific method claims bergson needed make order justify prior moral commitment freedom
russell takes particular exception bergson’s understanding number chapter two time free-will
according russell bergson uses outmoded spatial metaphor “extended images” describe nature mathematics well logic general
“bergson succeeds making theory number possible confusing particular collection number terms again number general” writes russell see philosophy bergson[page needed] history western philosophy[page needed]
furthermore writers such russell wittgenstein james saw élan vital projection subjectivity onto world
external world according certain[which?] theories probability provides less less indeterminism further refinement scientific method
brief should confuse moral psychological subjective demand new underivable unexplained universe
[citation needed] one's subjective sense duration differs non-human world difference according ancient materialist lucretius should characterized either becoming being creation destruction de rerum natura
suzanne guerlac argued recent resurgence scholarly interest bergson related growing influence follower deleuze within continental philosophy there return bergson today then largely due gilles deleuze whose own work etched contours new bergson
because deleuze bergson also because deleuze's own thought deeply engaged predecessor even bergson explicitly mentioned
leonard lawlor valentine moulard agree guerlac recent revitalization bergsonism [
almost entirely due deleuze
explain bergson's concept multiplicity very heart deleuze's thought duration model deleuze's 'becomings
other aspect attracted deleuze indeed connected first bergson's criticism concept negation creative evolution
thus bergson became resource criticism hegelian dialectic negative
