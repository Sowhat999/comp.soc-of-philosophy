less known aristophanes plays
fact plays main source information
conventional old comedy chorus speak behalf author during address called 'parabasis' thus biographical facts found there
however these facts relate almost entirely career dramatist plays contain few clear unambiguous clues personal beliefs private life
comic poet age conventional poet assume role 'teacher' didaskalos though specifically referred training chorus rehearsal also covered relationship audience commentator significant issues
aristophanes claimed writing clever discerning audience yet also declared 'other times' judge audience according reception plays
sometimes boasts originality dramatist yet plays consistently espouse opposition radical new influences athenian society
caricatured leading figures arts notably euripides whose influence own work however once begrudgingly acknowledged politics especially populist cleon philosophy/religion socrates most obvious target
such caricatures seem imply aristophanes old-fashioned conservative yet view leads contradictions
argued aristophanes produced plays mainly entertain audience win prestigious competitions
plays written production great dramatic festivals athens lenaia city dionysia judged awarded prizes competition works other comic dramatists
elaborate series lotteries designed prevent prejudice corruption reduced voting judges city dionysia just five number
these judges probably reflected mood audiences yet there much uncertainty composition those audiences
theatres certainly huge seating least 10 000 theatre dionysus
day's program city dionysia example crowded three tragedies 'satyr' play ahead comedy possible many poorer citizens typically main supporters demagogues like cleon occupied festival holiday other pursuits
conservative views expressed plays might therefore reflect attitudes dominant group unrepresentative audience
production process might also influenced views expressed plays
throughout most aristophanes' career chorus essential play's success recruited funded choregus wealthy citizen appointed task archons
choregus regard personal expenditure chorus civic duty public honour aristophanes showed knights wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities punishment imposed them demagogues populists like cleon
thus political conservatism plays may reflect views wealthiest section athenian society whose generosity dramatists depended putting their plays
aristophanes' first play banqueters produced athens ambitious imperial power peloponnesian war fourth year
plays often express pride achievement older generation victors marathon yet jingoistic staunchly opposed war sparta
plays particularly scathing criticism war profiteers among whom populists such cleon figure prominently
time last play produced around 386 bc athens defeated war empire dismantled undergone transformation being political intellectual centre greece
aristophanes part transformation shared intellectual fashions period — structure plays evolves old comedy until last surviving play wealth ii closely resembles new comedy
however uncertain whether led merely responded changes audience expectations
aristophanes won second prize city dionysia 427 bc first play banqueters now lost
won first prize there next play babylonians also now lost
usual foreign dignitaries attend city dionysia babylonians caused embarrassment athenian authorities since depicted cities athenian league slaves grinding mill
influential citizens notably cleon reviled play slander against polis possibly took legal action against author
details trial unrecorded speaking through hero third play acharnians staged lenaia there few no foreign dignitaries poet carefully distinguishes polis real targets acerbic wit ἡμῶν γὰρ ἄνδρες κοὐχὶ τὴν πόλιν λέγω μέμνησθε τοῦθ᾽ ὅτι οὐχὶ τὴν πόλιν λέγω ἀλλ᾽ ἀνδράρια μοχθηρά παρακεκομμένα
people among us don't mean polis remember — don't mean polis - wicked little men counterfeit kind
aristophanes repeatedly savages cleon later plays
these satirical diatribes appear no effect cleon's political career — few weeks after performance knights - play full anti-cleon jokes - cleon elected prestigious board ten generals
cleon also seems no real power limit control aristophanes caricatures continued up even beyond death
absence clear biographical facts aristophanes scholars make educated guesses based interpretation language plays
inscriptions summaries comments hellenistic byzantine scholars also provide useful clues
know however combination these sources especially comments knights clouds aristophanes' first three plays directed — instead directed callistratus philoneides arrangement seemed suit aristophanes since appears used these same directors many later plays well philoneides example later directed frogs also credited perhaps wrongly directing wasps
aristophanes's use directors complicates our reliance plays sources biographical information because apparent self-references might made reference directors instead
thus example statement chorus acharnians seems indicate 'poet' close personal association island aegina yet terms 'poet' poietes 'director' didaskalos often interchangeable dramatic poets usually directed their own plays therefore reference play either aristophanes callistratus
similarly hero acharnians complains cleon dragging me court over last year's play here again clear reference aristophanes callistratus either whom might prosecuted cleon
comments made chorus referring aristophanes clouds interpreted evidence hardly 18 years old first play banqueters produced
second parabasis wasps appears indicate reached kind temporary accommodation cleon following either controversy over babylonians subsequent controversy over knights
inferred statements clouds peace aristophanes prematurely bald
know aristophanes probably victorious least once city dionysia babylonians 427 least three times lenaia acharnians 425 knights 424 frogs 405
frogs fact won unique distinction repeat performance subsequent festival
know son aristophanes araros also comic poet heavily involved production father's play wealth ii 388
araros also thought responsible posthumous performances now lost plays aeolosicon ii cocalus possible last these won prize city dionysia 387
appears second son philippus twice victorious lenaia directed eubulus’ comedies
third son called either nicostratus philetaerus man latter name appears catalogue lenaia victors two victories first probably late 370 s
plato's symposium appears useful source biographical information aristophanes reliability open doubt
purports record conversations dinner party both aristophanes socrates guests held seven years after performance clouds play socrates cruelly caricatured
guests alcibiades even quotes play teasing socrates over appearance yet there no indication any ill-feeling socrates aristophanes
plato's aristophanes fact genial character interpreted evidence plato's own friendship their friendship appears corroborated epitaph aristophanes reputedly written plato playwright's soul compared eternal shrine graces
plato boy events symposium supposed occurred possible aristophanes fact based reading plays
example conversation among guests turns subject love aristophanes explains notion terms amusing allegory device often uses plays
represented suffering attack hiccoughs might humorous reference crude physical jokes plays
tells other guests quite happy thought amusing wary appearing ridiculous
fear being ridiculed consistent declaration knights embarked career comic playwright warily after witnessing public contempt ridicule other dramatists incurred
aristophanes survived peloponnesian war two oligarchic revolutions two democratic restorations interpreted evidence actively involved politics despite highly political plays
probably appointed council five hundred year beginning fourth century such appointments very common democratic athens
socrates trial leading up own death put issue personal conscience those troubled times quite succinctly ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστι τὸν τῷ ὄντι μαχούμενον ὑπὲρ τοῦ δικαίου καὶ εἰ μέλλει ὀλίγον χρόνον σωθήσεσθαι ἰδιωτεύειν ἀλλὰ μὴ δημοσιεύειν

poetry muse reading louvre language aristophanes' plays old comedy generally valued ancient commentators model attic dialect
orator quintilian believed charm grandeur attic dialect made old comedy example orators study follow considered inferior these respects works homer
revival interest attic dialect may responsible recovery circulation aristophanes' plays during 4 th 5 th centuries ad resulting their survival today
aristophanes' plays attic dialect couched verse plays appreciated their poetic qualities
aristophanes' contemporaries works homer hesiod formed cornerstones hellenic history culture
thus poetry moral social significance made inevitable topic comic satire
aristophanes very conscious literary fashions traditions plays feature numerous references other poets
these include rival comic dramatists such eupolis hermippus predecessors such magnes crates cratinus also tragedians notably aeschylus sophocles euripides three whom mentioned e
aristophanes equal these great tragedians subtle use lyrics
appears modelled approach language euripides particular much comic dramatist cratinus labelled 'euripidaristophanist' addicted hair-splitting niceties
full appreciation aristophanes' plays requires understanding poetic forms employed virtuoso skill their different rhythms associations
there three broad poetic forms iambic dialogue tetrameter verses lyrics iambic dialogue aristophanes achieves effect resembling natural speech through use iambic trimeter corresponding effects achieved english poets such shakespeare using iambic pentameters
realistic use metre makes ideal both dialogue soliloquy instance prologue before arrival chorus audience introduced main issues plot
acharnians opens these three lines hero dikaiopolis rendered here english iambic pentameters how many things vex my heart! pleasures few very few — just four - stressful things manysandthousandsandheaps! here aristophanes employs frequent device arranging syntax final word line comes comic climax
hero's pleasures few number them τέτταρα four causes complaint many beggar numerical description must invent own word them ψαμμακοσιογάργαρα literally 'sandhundredheaps' here paraphrased 'manysandthousandsandheaps'
use invented compound words another comic device frequently found plays
tetrameter catalectic verses these long lines anapests trochees iambs each line ideally measured four dipodes pairs feet used various situations within each play such formal debates agons characters typically anapestic rhythm excited dialogue heated argument typically trochaic rhythm same early tragedy long speeches declaimed chorus parabases either anapestic trochaic rhythms informal debates barely above level ordinary dialogue typically iambic
anapestic rhythms naturally jaunty many limericks trochaic metre suited rapid delivery word 'trochee' fact derived trechein 'to run' demonstrated example choruses enter speed often aggressive mood however even though both these rhythms seem 'bowl along' aristophanes often varies them through use complex syntax substituted metres adapting rhythms requirements serious argument
anapestic passage frogs instance character aeschylus presents view poetry supposed serious leads comic interruption god dionysus aes
orpheus singing taught us religion how wrong people kill learned musaeus medicinal cures science divination
it's farming you want hesiod knows plant harvest
how godlike homer got famous i'll tell you ask taught us good men should know discipline fortitude battle-readiness
no-one taught pantocles — yesterday marching men up down parade crest helmet fell off! rhythm begins typical anapestic gallop slows down consider revered poets hesiod homer then gallops off again comic conclusion expense unfortunate pantocles
such subtle variations rhythm common plays allowing serious points made while still whetting audience's appetite next joke
lyrics almost nothing known music accompanied greek lyrics metre often varied complex difficult modern readers audiences get feel intended effects yet aristophanes still impresses charm simplicity lyrics
most memorable haunting lyrics dignified hymns set free comic action example below taken wasps lyric merely comic interlude rhythm steadily trochaic
syntax original greek natural unforced probably accompanied brisk cheerful music gliding concluding pun expense amynias thought lost fortune gambling
though myself often seem bright chap awkward none comes close amynias son sellos bigwig clan man once saw dine rich leogorus
now poor antiphon lives apples pomegranates yet got himself appointed ambassador pharsalus way up there thessaly home poor penestes happy everyone penniless is! pun here english translation penestes-penniless weak version greek pun πενέσταισι-πενέστης penéstaisi-penéstĕs destitute
many puns plays based words similar rather identical observed there them scholars yet able identify
others based double meanings
sometimes entire scenes constructed puns acharnians megarian farmer pigs megarian farmer defies athenian embargo against megarian trade tries trade daughters disguised pigs except pig ancient slang vagina
since embargo against megara pretext peloponnesian war aristophanes naturally concludes whole mess happened because three cunts
argued most important feature language plays imagery particularly use similes metaphors pictorial expressions
'the knights' example ears character selective hearing represented parasols open close
frogs aeschylus compose verses manner horse rolling sandpit
plays feature revelations human perfectibility poetic rather religious character such marriage hero pisthetairos zeus's paramour birds 'recreation' old athens crowned roses end knights
rhetoric widely believed aristophanes condemned rhetoric both moral political grounds
states “a speaker trained new rhetoric may use talents deceive jury bewilder opponents thoroughly trial loses semblance fairness”
speaking “art” flattery evidence points towards fact many aristophanes’ plays actually created intent attack view rhetoric
most noticeable attack seen play banqueters two brothers different educational backgrounds argue over education better
brother comes background “old-fashioned” education while other brother appears product sophistic education
chorus mainly used aristophanes defense against rhetoric often talk topics such civic duty those educated classical teachings
aristophanes’ opinion job those educated adults protect public deception stand beacon light those gullible others
main reasons why aristophanes against sophists came existence requirements listed leaders organization
money essential meant roughly pupils studying sophists came upper-class backgrounds excluded rest polis
aristophanes believed education knowledge public service anything excluded willing minds nothing abomination
concludes politicians study rhetoric must doubtful citizenships unspeakable morals too much arrogance”
old comedy thalia muse comedy gazing upon comic mask detail muses' sarcophagus greek word comedy kōmōidía derives words 'revel' 'song' kōmos ōdē according aristotle comic drama actually developed song
first official comedy city dionysia staged until 487/6 bc time tragedy already long established there
first comedy lenaia staged later still 20 years before performance there acharnians first aristophanes' surviving plays
according aristotle comedy slow gain official acceptance because nobody took seriously yet sixty years after comedy first appeared city dionysia aristophanes observed producing comedies most difficult work
competition dionysian festivals needed dramatic conventions plays judged also fuelled innovations
developments quite rapid aristotle distinguish 'old' 'new' comedy 330 bc
trend old comedy new comedy saw move away highly topical concerns real individuals local issues towards generalized situations stock characters
partly due internationalization cultural perspectives during after peloponnesian war
ancient commentators such plutarch new comedy sophisticated form drama old comedy
however old comedy fact complex sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches humour entertainment
aristophanes' early plays genre appears developed around complex set dramatic conventions these gradually simplified abandoned
city dionysia lenaia celebrated honour dionysus god wine ecstasy
euripides' play bacchae offers best insight 5 th century ideas god
old comedy understood celebration exuberant sense release inherent worship interested finding targets satire any kind advocacy
during city dionysia statue god brought theatre temple outside city remained theatre throughout festival overseeing plays like privileged member audience
frogs god appears also dramatic character enters theatre ludicrously disguised hercules
observes audience every time hand hear joke comic dramatist like phrynichus aristophanes' rivals ages year
scene opens play reminder audience nobody above mockery old comedy — even patron god practitioners
gods artists politicians ordinary citizens legitimate targets comedy kind licensed buffoonery there no legal redress anyone slandered play
there certain limits scope satire easily defined
impiety punished 5 th century athens absurdities implicit traditional religion open ridicule
polis allowed slandered stated biography section article depend audience festival involved
convenience old comedy represented aristophanes' early plays analysed below terms three broad characteristics — topicality festivity complexity
dramatic structure contributes complexity aristophanes' plays
however associated poetic rhythms meters little relevance english translations therefore treated separate section
topicality old comedy's emphasis real personalities local issues makes plays difficult appreciate today without aid scholarly commentaries — see example articles knights wasps peace lists topical references
topicality plays unique consequences both writing production plays ancient athens
individual masks actors classical athens wore masks whereas tragedy new comedy these identified stereotypical characters old comedy masks often caricatures real people
perhaps socrates attracted lot attention old comedy because face lent itself easily caricature mask-makers
knights mask makers too afraid make caricature cleon there represented paphlagonian slave assured audience clever enough identify anyway
real scene action since old comedy makes numerous references people audience theatre itself real scene action theatrical illusion treated something joke
acharnians example pnyx just few steps hero's front door peace olympia separated athens few moments' supposed flight dung beetle
audience sometimes drawn even dragged action
hero peace returns athens flight olympia tells audience looked like rascals seen heavens seen up close look even worse
acharnians hero confronts archon basileus sitting front row demands awarded first prize drinking competition none too subtle way aristophanes request first prize drama competition
self-mocking theatre frequent parodying tragedy aspect old comedy modern audiences find difficult understand
lenaia city dionysia included performances both comedies tragedies thus references tragedy highly topical immediately relevant original audience
comic dramatist also poked fun comic poets even ridiculed himself
possible indicated earlier aristophanes mocked own baldness
clouds chorus compares unwed young mother acharnians chorus mockingly depicts athens' greatest weapon war against sparta
political theatre lenaia city dionysus state-sponsored religious festivals though latter prestigious two both occasions official pomp circumstance
ceremonies lenaia overseen archon basileus officials eleusinian mysteries
city dionysia overseen archon eponymous priest dionysus
opening ceremonies city dionysia featured addition ceremonial arrival god parade full armour sons warriors died fighting polis until end peloponnesian war presentation annual tribute subject states
religious political issues topics hardly ignored such setting plays often treat them quite seriously
even jokes serious topic politics — especially wartime
butts most savage jokes opportunists prey gullibility their fellow citizens including oracle-mongers exponents new religious practices war-profiteers political fanatics
acharnians example lamachus represented crazed militarist whose preparations war hilariously compared hero's preparations dinner party
cleon emerges numerous similes metaphors knights protean form comic evil clinging political power every possible means long yet play also includes simple hymns invoking poseidon athena ends visions miraculously transformed demos
morally reformed citizenry athens
imaginative visions return peaceful activities resulting peace sparta plea leniency citizens suspected complicity oligarchic revolt other examples serious purpose behind plays
teasing taunting festival audience presented comic dramatist wide range targets just political religious ones — anyone known audience mocked any reason such diseases physical deformities ugliness family misfortunes bad manners perversions dishonesty cowardice battle clumsiness
foreigners conspicuous presence imperial athens particularly city dionysia often appear plays comically mispronouncing attic words — these include spartans lysistrata scythians thesmophoriazusae persians boeotians megarians acharnians
festivity lenaia city dionysia religious festivals resembled gala rather church service
dirty jokes relaxation standards behaviour permitted holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men gods
old comedy rich obscenities crude jokes often very detailed difficult understand without expert commentary chorus acharnians places curse antimachus choregus accused niggardly conduct wishing upon night-time mugging returns home drunken party envisioning stoops down pick up rock darkness accidentally picking up fresh turd instead
then envisioned hurling turd attacker missing accidentally hitting cratinus lyric poet admired aristophanes
particularly funny because curse sung chanted choreographed style chorus 24 grown men otherwise known audience respectable citizens
musical extravaganza chorus vital success play old comedy long after lost relevance tragedy
technically competition dramatic festivals poets choruses
fact eight aristophanes' eleven surviving plays named after chorus
aristophanes' time chorus tragedy relatively small twelve members role reduced awkwardly placed commentator old comedy chorus large numbering 24 actively involved plot entry action frequently spectacular movements practised military precision sometimes involved choreographed skirmishes actors
expenditure costumes training maintenance chorus considerable perhaps many people original audience enjoyed comedy mainly spectacle music
chorus gradually lost significance new comedy began develop
obvious costumes consistent holiday spirit much humour old comedy slapstick buffoonery dirty jokes require audience's careful attention often relying visual cues
actors playing male roles appear worn tights over grotesque padding prodigious leather phallus barely concealed short tunic
female characters played men easily recognized long saffron tunics
sometimes visual cues deliberately confused comic effect frogs dionysus arrives stage saffron tunic buskin boots tragic actor lion skin cloak usually characterized heracles - absurd outfit provokes character heracles no doubt provoked audience guffaws helpless mirth
farcical anti-climax holiday spirit might also responsible aspect comic plot seem bewildering modern audiences
major confrontation agon 'good' 'bad' characters play often resolved decisively favour former long before end play
rest play deals farcical consequences succession loosely connected scenes
farcical anti-climax explained variety ways depending particular play
wasps instance thought indicate gradual change main character's perspective lessons agon slowly absorbed
acharnians explained terms unifying theme underlies episodes demonstrating practical benefits come wisdom
early release dramatic tension consistent holiday meanings old comedy allows audience relax uncomplicated enjoyment spectacle music jokes celebrations characterize remainder play
celebration hero's victory often concludes sexual conquest sometimes takes form wedding thus providing action joyous sense closure
complexity development new comedy involved trend towards realistic plots simpler dramatic structure softer tone
old comedy comedy vigorously democratic polis height power gave aristophanes freedom explore limits humour even point undermining humour itself
inclusive comedy old comedy provided variety entertainments diverse audience
accommodated serious purpose light entertainment hauntingly beautiful lyrics buffoonery puns invented words obscenities disciplined verse wildly absurd plots formal dramatic structure
fantasy absurdity fantasy old comedy unrestricted impossibilities ignored
situations developed logically absurd conclusions approach humour echoed instance works lewis carroll eugène ionesco theatre absurd
crazy costume worn dionysus frogs typical absurd result obtained logical grounds — wears woman's saffron-coloured tunic because effeminacy aspect divinity buskin boots because interested reviving art tragedy lion skin cape because like heracles mission leads hades
absurdities develop logically initial premises plot
knights instance cleon's corrupt service people athens originally depicted household relationship slave dupes master
introduction rival member household leads absurd shift metaphor cleon rival become erastai competing affections eromenos hawkers oracles competing attention credulous public athletes race approval orators competing popular vote
resourceful hero aristophanic comedy hero independent-minded self-reliant individual
something ingenuity homer's odysseus much shrewdness farmer idealized hesiod's works days subjected corrupt leaders unreliable neighbours
typically devises complicated highly fanciful escape intolerable situation
thus dikaiopolis acharnians contrives private peace treaty spartans bdelucleon wasps turns own house private law court order keep jury-addicted father safely home trygaeus peace flies olympus giant dung beetle obtain end peloponnesian war pisthetairus birds sets off establish own colony becomes instead ruler bird kingdom rival gods
resourceful cast numerous surprising developments aristophanic plot changes scene farcical comings goings minor characters towards end play managed according theatrical convention three principal actors fourth actor often leader chorus permitted deliver short speeches
songs addresses audience chorus gave actors hardly enough time off-stage draw breath prepare changes scene
complex structure action aristophanic play obeyed crazy logic own yet unfolded within formal dramatic structure repeated minor variations play another
different structural elements associated different poetic meters rhythms these generally lost english translations
dramatic structure structural elements typical aristophanic plot summarized follows prologue - introductory scene dialogue and/or soliloquy addressed audience expressed iambic trimeter explaining situation resolved play parodos - arrival chorus dancing singing sometimes followed choreographed skirmish actors often expressed long lines tetrameters symmetrical scenes - passages featuring songs declaimed verses long lines tetrameters arranged symmetrically two sections such each half resembles other meter line length agon parabasis considered specific instances symmetrical scenes parabasis - verses through chorus addresses audience directly firstly middle play again near end see section below parabasis agon - formal debate decides outcome play typically anapestic tetrameter though iambs sometimes used delineate inferior arguments episodes - sections dialogue iambic trimeter often succession scenes featuring minor characters towards end play songs 'strophes'/'antistrophes' 'odes'/'antodes' - often symmetrical pairs each half same meter number lines other used transitions other structural elements scenes while actors change costume often commenting action exodus - departure chorus actors song dance celebrating hero's victory sometimes celebrating symbolic marriage
rules competition prevent playwright arranging adjusting these elements suit particular needs
acharnians peace example there no formal agon whereas clouds there two agons
parabasis parabasis address audience chorus chorus leader while actors leave left stage
role chorus sometimes out character author's voice sometimes character although these capacities often difficult distinguish
generally parabasis occurs somewhere middle play often there second parabasis towards end
elements parabasis defined named scholars probable aristophanes' own understanding less formal
selection elements vary play play varies considerably within plays first second parabasis
early plays acharnians birds fairly uniform their approach however following elements parabasis found within them
kommation brief prelude comprising short lines often including valediction departing actors such ἴτε χαίροντες go rejoicing!
parabasis proper usually defense author's work includes criticism audience's attitude
declaimed long lines 'anapestic tetrameters'
aristophanes himself refers parabasis proper 'anapests'
pnigos sometimes known 'a choker' comprises few short lines appended parabasis proper kind rapid patter suggested effects achieved pnigos heard lord chancellor's nightmare song act 2 gilbert sullivan's iolanthe
epirrhematic syzygies these symmetrical scenes mirror each other meter number lines
form part first parabasis often comprise entire second parabasis
characterized following elements strophe ode these lyrics variety meters sung chorus first parabasis invocation gods comic interlude second parabasis
epirrhema these usually long lines trochaic tetrameters
broadly political their significance probably spoken leader chorus character
antistrophe antode these songs mirror strophe/ode meter length function
another declaimed passage mirrors epirrhema meter length function
wasps thought offer best example conventional approach elements parabasis identified located play follows
elements wasps st parabasis 2 nd parabasis kommation lines 1009-14 --- parabasis proper lines 1015-50 --- pnigos lines 1051-59 --- strophe lines 1060-70 lines 1265-74 epirrhema lines 1071-90 lines 1275-83 antistrophe lines 1091-1101 missing antepirrhema lines 1102-1121 lines 1284-91 textual corruption probably reason absence antistrophe second parabasis
however there several variations ideal even within early plays
example parabasis proper clouds lines 518-62 composed eupolidean meter rather anapests second parabasis includes kommation lacks strophe antistrophe antepirrhema clouds lines 1113-30
second parabasis acharnians lines 971-99 considered hybrid parabasis/song
declaimed sections merely continuations strophe antistrophe unlike typical parabasis seems comment actions occur stage during address
understanding old comedy conventions such parabasis necessary proper understanding aristophanes' plays other hand sensitive appreciation plays necessary proper understanding conventions
influence legacy aristophanes master old comedy menander master new comedy
tragic dramatists sophocles euripides died near end peloponnesian war art tragedy thereafter ceased develop yet comedy continue evolve after defeat athens possible because aristophanes master craftsman lived long enough help usher new age
indeed according ancient source platonius c
9 th century ad aristophanes's last plays aioliskon neither parabasis nor any choral lyrics making type middle comedy while kolakos anticipated elements new comedy including rape recognition scene
aristophanes seems appreciation formative role development comedy indicated comment clouds audience judged other times according reception plays
clouds awarded third
last place after original performance text come down modern age subsequent draft aristophanes intended read rather acted
circulation plays manuscript extended their influence beyond original audience over whom fact seem little no practical influence affect career cleon failed persuade athenians pursue honourable peace sparta clear instrumental trial execution socrates whose death probably resulted public animosity towards philosopher's disgraced associates such alcibiades exacerbated course own intransigence during trial
plays manuscript form put surprising uses — indicated earlier used study rhetoric recommendation quintilian students attic dialect fourth fifth centuries ad
