since 2005 ruhlen advisory board genographic project held appointment visiting professor city university hong kong
ruhlen knew worked joseph greenberg three-and-a-half decades became principal advocate defender greenberg's methods language classification
[citation needed] books ruhlen author several books dealing languages world their classifications
guide languages world 1975 provides information phonological systems classifications 700 languages prefaced background information linguists well non-linguists
greatly expanded version work published 2005 santa fe institute web site
guide world’s languages volume classification 1987 includes classification world’s languages history analysis genetic classification languages defense controversial taxonomic work joseph greenberg
origin language tracing evolution mother tongue 1994 origin languages studies linguistic taxonomy 1994
1994 ruhlen published these two books similar themes titles directed different audiences
former book directed laypersons includes exercises readers invited classify languages themselves using greenberg's technique known variously mass comparison multilateral comparison
latter book aimed linguists maintains assumptions current among historical linguists incorrect
these assumptions valid criteria determining language family regular sound correspondences reconstruction protolanguage
according ruhlen these steps carried out after fact familyhood established classification
research topics multidisciplinary approach ruhlen forefront attempts coordinate results historical linguistics other human sciences such genetics archaeology
endeavor extensively worked geneticist luigi luca cavalli-sforza three decades archaeologist colin renfrew two decades
[citation needed] taxonomic methods main article mass comparison most criticism directed ruhlen centers defense joseph greenberg's technique language classification[citation needed] called mass comparison multilateral comparison
involves comparing selected elements morphology basic vocabulary languages being investigated examining them similarities sound meaning formulating hypothesis classification based these
ruhlen maintains such classification first step comparative method other operations historical linguistics particular formulation sound correspondences reconstruction protolanguage carried out after hypothesis classification established
while hock instance claims reconstruction proves genetic affinity indo-european uralic dravidian austronesian bantu uto-aztecan proved successful reconstructions ruhlen disagrees saying yet these families universally accepted valid families before anyone even thought trying reconstruct protolanguage
example ruhlen mentions delbrück 1842–1922 considered indo-european proved time bopp beginning 19 th century basis proof juxtaposition words forms similar meaning
however ruhlen's claim refuted poser campbell
ruhlen believes classification world's languages supported population genetics research geneticist luigi luca cavalli-sforza identified distribution certain human genes populations throughout world
used evidence construct phylogenetic trees showing evolutionary history these populations
cavalli-sforza's findings argued match up remarkably well ruhlen's language classification
ruhlen's linguist opponents hold genetic relatedness cannot used adduce linguistic relatedness
tree criticized linguists anthropologists several grounds makes selective use languages populations omitting numerous sino-tibetan speakers northern china example assumes truth such linguistic groups austric amerind controversial several population groups listed defined their genes their languages making correlation irrelevant comparison genetic linguistic branching tautological well
amerind macrofamily main article amerind languages prevailing opinion classification western hemisphere languages there many separate language families americas among concrete evidence genetic affinity lacking
greenberg published contrary hypothesis amerind language family 1987 major books language americas
according amerind hypothesis languages north south america except na-dene eskimo–aleut language families belong single macrofamily
greenberg’s most controversial hypotheses updated ruhlen 2007
ruhlen published papers presenting research support e

ruhlen stresses importance three-way / u /

linguists attributed pronoun pattern other genetic causes
refers earliest beginnings dispute quoting personal letter edward sapir
kroeber 1918 getting down brass tacks how hell you going explain general american n- 'i' except genetically? it's disturbing know non-committal conservatism dodging after isn't it? great simplifications store us
greenberg ruhlen's views languages americas failed find acceptance among vast majority linguists working these languages
kusunda indo-pacific language main articles kusunda language indo-pacific languages whitehouse ruhlen others concluded kusunda language nepal belongs tentative indo-pacific superfamily rather belonging tibeto-burman group being language isolate

kitɛ juwoi actually demonstrative meaning never used personal pronoun
yeniseian–na-dene main articles na-dene languages yeniseian languages dene–caucasian languages dene–yeniseian languages according ruhlen linguistic evidence indicates yeniseian languages spoken central siberia most closely related na-dene languages western north america among concurring sapir includes haida
hypothesis supported separate researches heinrich k
werner edward j
vajda vajda rejects haida's membership na-dene language family
mean na-dene represents distinct migration peoples asia new world intermediate migration speakers putative proto-amerind estimated around 13000 years ago migration eskimo–aleut speakers around 5000 years ago
other times ruhlen maintained existence language family called dene–caucasian
proto-sapiens hypothesis main article proto-human language question proto-sapiens language global etymologies most mainstream historical linguists reject ruhlen's assumptions methodology holding impossible reconstruct language spoken least 30000 years ago possibly 100000 years ago
ruhlen responded bengtson never claimed reconstructed proto-sapiens simply pointed out reflexes very ancient words still found world’s languages each [global] etymology
present phonetic semantic gloss followed examples different language families
deal here reconstruction these [semantic phonetic] glosses intended merely characterize most general meaning phonological shape each root
future work reconstruction will no doubt discover cases most widespread meaning shape original
ruhlen also maintains “temporal ceiling” assumed many mainstream linguists time depth beyond comparative method fails considered lie roughly 6000 8000 years ago does exist now universally recognized existence language family old afroasiatic mention even older eurasiatic whose existence remains controversial shows comparative method reach farther past most linguists currently accept
