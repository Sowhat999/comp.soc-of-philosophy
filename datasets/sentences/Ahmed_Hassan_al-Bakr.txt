investments agriculture increased may 1970 government introduced new land reform
land reform tried revitalise iraqi agriculture resolving issues previous land reforms such paying attention relationship type land irrigation system limits how much land owned
co-operatives established cultivators obliged join them wanted benefit government subsidies investments
around time government also established several collective farms placate party's left-wing faction establishment collective farms soon halted
other measures also introduced benefited landholding peasants these reforms never able counter decline agricultural production
because high population growth time iraq became net importer food grains imports food grain increased twelvefold early 1960 s
introduction subsidies removal financial burdens peasantry populist also part al-bakr's plan creating patrimonial system himself top
system gave economic levers powers political elite used confiscate properties political opponents
continued sequestration land increased strength patrimonial system members political elite bestow lands people increase support government
government because government iraq's biggest landowner
co-operatives established provided means social control through their regulation
corruption also proved problem acquisition land people close political leadership repeated scale seen since time monarchy
patrimonial system also favoured those already owned land roughly one-third agricultural land owned estimated 3 percent landowners

negotiations iraqi government ipc began december 1971 ended march 1972 government given shares ipc's equity
however relations sooned soured ipc cut own production kirkuk field half
government saw proof company's arrogance government also began see danger private company controlling such vital source government's revenues
ipc nationalised june 1972
nationalisation ipc proved last important element foreign control over iraq's control iraq whole
