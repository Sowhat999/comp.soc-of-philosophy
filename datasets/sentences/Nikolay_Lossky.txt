once problem expressed dichotomy two opposing ideas fused order transcend dichotomy

understanding comprehension coming addressing object though part external world something joins consciousness perceiving subject directly noesis insight then becoming memory intuitionism foundation noema processes consciousness
human consciousness comprehends essence noumena object object's external phenomenon then assembled complete organic whole called experience
much object's defining understanding consciousness derived discursively rather intuitively instinctively object no meaning outside whole existence
lossky summed up concept term imminent
such much reality uncreated uncaused irrational random see libertarianism below validated rationally
freedom love energy uncaused uncreated
therefore consciousness interaction reality operates strictly rational partially much consciousness operates intuitively
intuitively done nous
nous consciousness focal point psyche organic connection object therefore material world whole
psyche here sensory input physical body inner being mind consciousness
interaction causing different levels maturing consciousness over time reinterpretation
dynamic retention experience constitutes process learning
reflective differentiation
phenomenology axiology consequently existence objects completely expressed logic words nor validated knowledge due objects having supernatural essence substance their composition supernatural ancient greek philosophy orthodox christian understanding supernatural uncreated uncaused
following orthodox christian substance theory see gregory palamas energy potential ontology without sentient agent
idealism lossky coined term substantive agent validate matter well energy uncreated substance essence
validation part gnosiology christian mysticism orthodoxy opposed russian materialist nihilist position states objects no thing itself no essence substance behind their phenomenon positivism
lossky based intuitivism gnosiology taught first principles uncreated uncaused
lossky's axiology teaching first principles dialectically
russian philosophy based soloviev expressed metaphysically essence object akin noumenon opposed appearance phenomenon random characteristics being essence characteristically sumbebekos
basis v soloviev's arguments against positivism cornerstone russian philosophy contained soloviev's against positivists
validation immediate apprehension truth value existence being intuitive expressed aristotle's noesis
each event having value existence because substantive agents being engaged event via neo-idealism giving event value existence
sobornost world organic whole see also priori posteriori main points lossky's онтология ontology world organic whole understood human consciousness
intuition insight noesis greek direct contemplation objects furthermore assembling entire set cognition sensory perception complete undivided organic whole
expression consciousness without thought raw uninterpreted rational faculty mind
thus mind's dianoia rational logical faculty deficiency finiteness inconclusiveness due logic's incompleteness causes perceived conflict objectivism materialism external world idealism spiritual inner experience forms philosophy
intuitive instinctual re-action without rational processing rational faculty mind
outside comprehension via dianoia faculty mind consciousness nous
intuition being analogous instinctual consciousness
intuition functions without rational logical thought absorption experience called contemplation
rational logical thought via dianoia nous then works reflection hindsight organize experience comprehensible order
memory knowledge derived rationalizing faculty mind called epistemological knowledge
intuitive knowledge gnosis preprocessed knowledge uninterpreted then being made logical facility mind history memory
intuition rather rationalization also see henri bergson whom influenced lossky determining factor manifests integral factor during actual conscious experience
lossky's ontology being consistent leibniz's optimism expressed best possible worlds contrast pessimism nihilism pro-western russian philosophers
lossky's work also opposed pagan elements pagan philosophers influence work
logical faculty mind finite temporal sense will eventually become infinite theosis such seeks infinite rather opposes
lossky believed philosophy transcend rational limits manifest mystical understanding experience
include understanding encompasses intuitive irrational philosophically done stochastics rather strictly pagan approach good deterministic force opposed evil irrational indeterminate force
course being teaching christian faith philosophical principle called free will intrinsic component conscious existence manifests sobornost transcending pagan dichotomy reason versus superstition determinism versus in-determinism
knowledge memory see also noetic consciousness once knowledge abstracted conscious experience becomes epistemological knowledge then stored ontological format mind format itself priori
manipulation memory reapplication memory knowledge post-processed knowledge
lossky's ontology agent's сущность essence expressed being becoming possible both person transcends time space while being closely connected whole world while world
much lossky's working out ontological theory knowledge done collaboration close friend semen l
metaphysical libertarianism see also theodicy metaphysical libertarianism lossky metaphysical libertarian taught people uncreated energy aristotle potential plotinus
being very much inline vitalism day
though lossky strictly adhere vitalism rather predecessor monadology living forces dynamis theory
contrast leibniz's theory monadology against cartesian mind-body dualism
rejection vitalism dualism mind body being different substances
lossky's substantive agents potential dynamis act beings energy upon potential
power potential comes individual
spontaneous organic reality structures orders itself reconcile opposing forces sobornost doing while maintaining order freewill
each pole existence created uncreated gnosiology opposing ideologies reaching compromise through value existence manifesting complete organic whole sobornost
“ second section selection agent's free act
consequently temporal order events uniform even inorganic nature
quite possible although two electrons millions time repulsed each other will next time
functional connections ideal forms conditioning existence world system-e
mathematical principles laws hierarchy values their significance conduct conditioning presence meaning world-are independent agents' will
violation these laws unthinkable destroy agent's freedom merely create possibility activity such value
those laws condition cosmic structure within frame work there freedom infinite variety activities
system spatiotemporal numerical forms provides room activities opposed another direction value significance world
absence rigidly uniform connection events does make science impossible
sufficient science there should less regular connection events time
lower agent's stage development uniform their manifestations
those cases there may statistical laws
many misunderstandings doctrine free will disposed distinguishing formal material freedom
formal freedom means each given case agent may refrain particular manifestation replace another
freedom absolute cannot lost under any circumstance
material freedom means degree creative power possessed agent finds expression capable creating
unlimited kingdom god members unanimously combine their forces communal creativeness even derive help god's omnipotence
agents outside kingdom god state spiritual deterioration very little material freedom though their formal freedom unimpaired
life outside kingdom god result wrong use free will
— history russian philosophy section n o lossky intuitivists pg 260 lossky's argument determinism account cause energy universe
energy being substance created destroyed see law conservation energy
each agent accounting their existence their own dynamistic manifestation
dynamistic manifestation being act energy derived neoplatonic interpretation
“ first section determinists deny freedom will ground every event cause
mean causality order temporal sequence event after other events uniformity sequence
causation generation creation other dynamic aspects causality ruled out
lossky proves will free taking starting point law causality defending dynamistic interpretation
every event arises out itself created someone cannot created other events having temporal form events fall away every instant realm past no creative power generate future
supertemporal substantival agents-i
actual potential personalities- bearers creative power create events their own vital manifestations
according dynamistic interpretation causality necessary distinguish among conditions under event takes place cause occasion happening
cause substantival agent himself bearer creative power other circumstances merely occasions manifestations neither forced nor predetermined them
agents' creative power superqualitative does therefore predetermine particular values agent will select final end
