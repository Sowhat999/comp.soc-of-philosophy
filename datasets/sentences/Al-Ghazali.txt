reception work according william montgomery watt al-ghazali considered himself mujaddid revivier age
many perhaps most later muslims concurred according watt even considered greatest muslim after prophet muhammad
example islamic scholar al-safadi states “ muhammad ibn muhammad ibn muhammad ibn ahmad proof islam ornament faith abu hamid al-tusi al-ghazali shafi'ite jurist later years without rival jurist al-yafi'i stated “ called proof islam undoubtedly worthy name absolutely trustworthy respect faith how many epitome given us setting forth basic principles religion how much repetitive summarised epitomised lengthy
how many simple explanation given us hard fathom brief elucidation clear solution knotty problems
used moderation being quiet decisive silencing adversary though words like sharp sword-thrust refuting slanderer protecting high-road guidance
shafi'i jurist al-subki stated “ there prophet after muhammad al-ghazali man
also widely considered sunni scholar al dhahabi praise al ghazali “al-ghazzaali imaam shaykh prominent scholar hujjat al-islam wonder time zayn al-deem abu haamid muhammad ibn muhammad ibn muhammad ibn ahmad al-toosi al-shaafa’i al-ghazzaali author many books possessed utter intelligence
studied fiqh own town then moved nisapur company group students
stayed imaam al-haramayn gained deep knowledge fiqh within short period
became well-versed ‘ilm al-kalaam debate until became best debater
praise al-ghazali notwithstanding also received criticism ibn taymiyyah states “ assume someone narrated view salaf narrated far removed view salaf actually then little knowledge view salaf such abu’l-ma’aali abu hamid al-ghazali ibn al-khateeb like enough knowledge hadith qualify them ordinary scholars hadith let alone prominent scholars field
none these people any knowledge al-bukhari muslim their hadiths apart heard similar situation ordinary muslim cannot distinguish hadith regarded sahih mutawatir according scholars hadith hadith fabricated false
their books bear witness contain strange things most these scholars ‘ilm al-kalam science kalam sufis drifted away path salaf admit either time death before death
there many such well-known stories
abu hamid al-ghazali despite brilliance devotion allah knowledge kalam philosophy asceticism spiritual practices sufism ended up state confusion resorted path those claim find out things through dreams spiritual methods
ibn rushd averroes rationalist famously responded say philosophers incoherent itself make incoherent statement
[citation needed] rushd's book incoherence incoherence attempted refute al-ghazali's views though work well received muslim community
