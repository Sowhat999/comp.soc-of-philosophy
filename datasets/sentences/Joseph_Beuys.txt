joseph beuys lecture jeder mensch ein künstler - auf dem weg zur freiheitsgestalt des sozialen organismus photographed rainer rappmann de achberg germany 1978 teaching philosophy most important discussion epistemological character” stated beuys demonstrating desire continuous intellectual exchange
beuys attempted apply philosophical concepts pedagogical practice
beuys' action “how explain pictures dead hare” exemplifies performance especially relevant pedagogical field because deals “the difficulty explaining things”
artist spent three hours explaining art dead hare head covered honey gold leaf ulmer 2007 argues honey head hare itself model thinking man embodying ideas forms ulmer 2007 p
contemporary movements such performance art may considered 'laboratories' new pedagogy since research experiment replaced form guiding force ulmer 2007 p
during artform interview willoughby sharp 1969 beuys added famous statement - teaching my greatest work art - “the rest waste product demonstration
you want express yourself you must present something tangible
after awhile function historic document
objects aren’t very important any
want get origin matter thought behind
beuys saw role artist teacher shaman guide society new direction sotheby's catalog 1992
düsseldorf academy art beuys impose artistic style techniques students fact kept much work exhibitions hidden classroom because wanted students explore their own interests ideas talents
beuys' actions somewhat contradictory while extremely strict certain aspects classroom management instruction such punctuality need students take draughtsmanship classes encouraged students freely set their own artistic goals without having prescribe set curricula
another aspect beuys' pedagogy included open “ring discussions” beuys students discussed political philosophical issues day including role art democracy university society
beuys' ideas espoused class discussion art-making included free art education discovery creativity everyday life belief “everyone [was] artist
beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity manner expression emerge during course these discussions
while beuys' students enjoyed open discourse ringgesprache others including palermo immendorf disapproved classroom disorder anarchic characteristics eventually rejecting methods philosophies altogether
beuys also advocated taking art outside boundaries art system open up multiple possibilities bringing creativity areas life
nontraditional anti-establishment pedagogical practice philosophy made focus much controversy order battle policy “restricted entry” under few select students allowed attend art classes deliberately allowed students over-enroll courses anastasia shartin true belief those something teach those something learn should come together
according cornelia lauf 1992 “in order implement idea well host supporting notions encompassing cultural political concepts beuys crafted charismatic artistic persona infused work mystical overtones led called shaman messianic popular press
artist shaman beuys adopted shamanism presentation mode art also own life
although artist shaman trend modern art picasso gauguin beuys unusual respect integrated “his art life shaman role
beuys believed humanity turn rationality trying eliminate “emotions” thus eliminate major source energy creativity every individual
first lecture tour america telling audience humanity evolving state “spiritual” beings ought draw both our emotions our thinking represent total energy creativity every individual
beuys described how must seek out energize our spirituality link our thinking powers “our vision world must extended encompass invisible energies lost contact
beuys's own words “so appear kind shamanistic figure allude stress my belief other priorities need come up completely different plan working substances
instance places like universities everyone speaks rationally necessary kind enchanter appear
beuys often explained interviews saw used performative art shamanistic psychoanalytic techniques both educate heal general public
“it thus strategic stage use shaman's character subsequently gave scientific lectures
also times hand kind modern scientific analyst other hand actions synthetic existence shaman
strategy aimed creating people agitation instigating questions rather conveying complete perfect structure
kind psychoanalysis problems energy culture
respect art educative well therapeutic “his intention use these two forms discourse styles knowledge pedagogues
”he used shamanistic psychoanalytic techniques “manipulate symbols” affect audience
personal life beuys adopted felt hat felt suit cane vest standard look
imagined story being rescued tartar herdsmen maybe explanation beuys wanted “create” ritualistic aspect look adoption materials like felt fat
beuys experienced severe depression 1955 1957
after recovered beuys observed time “his personal crisis” caused question everything life called incident “a shamanistic initiation
shamanism related death shaman mediator world “otherworld”
saw death inevitability death people also death environment became through art political activism strong critic environmental destruction
time “i don’t use shamanism refer death vice versa through shamanism refer fatal character times live
same time also point out fatal character present overcome future

1980 building scepticism voiced belgian artist marcel broodthaers 1972 open letter compared beuys wagner art historian benjamin buchloh teaching staatliche kunstakademie just like beuys launched polemically forceful attack beuys
essay remains most vitriolic thoroughgoing critique both beuys's rhetoric referred “simple-minded utopian drivel” persona buchloh regards beuys both infantile messianic
firstly buchloh draws attention beuys's fictionalisation own biography sees symptomatic dangerous cultural tendency disavowing traumatic past retreating realms myth esoteric symbolism
buchloh attacks beuys failure acknowledge engage nazism holocaust their implications
secondly buchloh criticizes beuys displaying inability reluctance engage consequences work marcel duchamp
failure acknowledge framing function art institution inevitable dependence upon such institutions create meaning art objects
beuys championed art's power foster political transformation nevertheless failed acknowledge limits imposed upon such aspirations art museum dealership networks served somewhat less utopian ambitions
buchloh rather acknowledging collective contextual formation meaning beuys instead attempted prescribe control meanings art often form dubious esoteric symbolic codings
buchloh's critique developed number commentators such stefan germer rosalind krauss
rehabilitation buchloh's critique subject revision
attention given dismantling mythologized artistic persona utopian rhetoric regarded irresponsible even implied proto-fascist
since buchloh's essay written however great deal new archival material come light
most significantly beuys's proposal auschwitz-birkenau memorial submitted 1958
claimed existence such project invalidates buchloh's claim beuys retreated engaging nazi legacy point buchloh himself recently acknowledged although charges romanticism self-mythologizing remain
beuys's charisma eclecticism polarised audience
beuys attracted huge number admirers devotees tendency whom uncritically accept beuys's own explanations interpretive solutions work
contrast there those following buchloh relentlessly critical beuys's rhetoric use weaknesses argumentation dismiss work bogus
relatively few accounts concerned encounter works themselves exceptions arriving scholarship art historians such gene ray claudia mesch christa-maria lerm hayes briony fer alex potts others
drive here wrest potential beuys's work away artist's own rhetoric further explore both wider discursive formations within beuys operated time productively specific material properties works themselves
