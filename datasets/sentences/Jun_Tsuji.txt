being controversial writer heart tokyo's radical art scene tsuji himself believed living instead peasant soviet union time surely shot death
political climate exacerbated tsuji's urges towards vagabondage without objective completely light-heartedly walk-- having unawares become absorbed winds water grass among other things nature unusual my existence become suspicious
because my existence such suspicious position am flying off society vanishing
such circumstances there possibility feeling “vagabond's religious ecstasy”
such times may become utterly lost their experience
thus set myself putting something down paper last feelings those moments drift my mind am compelled make these feelings known
am driven write already too late become utterly shackled captive
thus after writing garrulously chatting often feel surely done something tremendously pointless
results me lacking spirit write
nevertheless thus far here out written will continue write
my impulse wander comes uneasiness staying still
uneasiness me quite dreadful

like commandment-breaking monk like christ
vagrants labourers town gather
defeated unemployed penniless find their own home religion
disciples hungry poor world
surrounded these disciples passionately preaches good news nihilism
christlike preaches drunken nonsense
then disciples call merely “tsuji” without respect sometimes hit head
strange religion
here tsuji regrettably portrayed religious character
sounds contradictory tsuji religious man without religion
art religion neither tsuji's life religious
tsuji calls himself unmensch
nietzsche's zarathustra religious
then tsuji's teaching better religion nietzsche's tsuji lives accord principles himself
tsuji sacrifice modern culture
japanese literary world tsuji considered rebel
because drunkard nor because lacks manners nor because anarchist
because puts forth dirty ironies boldly bandit
tsuji himself very shy timid person
clarity self-respect exposes falsities famous literary world
[though] many really comes across anarchistic rogue
literary world sees having born world provide source gossip like chaplin producing seeds humour their rumours
common japanese literati understand laugh chaplin contradictory tragedy
society base closed-minded people idealists taken madmen clowns
tsuji jun drunk
doesn't drink can't stand suffering sorrow life
rare occasion sober
does look part incompetent unmensch-ian fool
then faithful disciples bring saké place ceremonial offering pour electricity back robot heart wait start moving
way teaching unmensch begins
religion weak proletariat egoists those broken personalities same time-- most pure most sorrowful religion modern intellectuals
