clark argues moral basis humanism human beings equal moral status now entrenched theory practice fail consider radical idea used
writes behind idea notion human beings way uniquely gifted perhaps share divine
human/non-human divide promoted prevent human beings being treated like animals utilitarian calculation rather ends themselves
writes now know non-human animals much closer humans previously thought therefore similar considerations must extended them
highlights incongruity modern thinkers being willing ignore idea human beings made image god yet unwilling accept argues moral conclusion stems rejection idea namely ought treat non-humans radically less consideration treat humans
writes species differences racial differences 'writ large' plainly wrong make such racial differences ground radically different treatment
concede wrong injure humans must also wrong identical very similar injury non-humans
argues [t]his often meant claim 'animals rights
our forebears lacked full understanding extent our welfare depends upon health global ecosystem extent our evolutionary cousins hurt harmed injured ways analogous ourselves
question before us simply how may produce greatest ratio pleasure pain wholly vacuous program nor yet rights creatures before community formulates them how may best order communities social global parts? answer believe must lie our taking seriously already know matters even animals their own plain pleasure our survival even species depends upon being able maintain create substantial civil ecosystems household civil national global levels
