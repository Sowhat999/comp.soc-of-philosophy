philosophy partial marble bust chrysippus roman copy hellenistic original louvre museum
chrysippus long successful career resisting attacks academy hoped simply defend stoicism against assaults past also against possible attack future
took doctrines zeno cleanthes crystallized them became definitive system stoicism
elaborated physical doctrines stoics their theory knowledge created much their formal logic
short chrysippus made stoic system
without chrysippus there no stoa
logic chrysippus much subject logic created system propositional logic
aristotle's term logic concerned interrelations terms such socrates man men mortal socrates man socrates mortal
stoic logic other hand concerned interrelations propositions such day day light day light
though earlier megarian dialecticians diodorus cronus philo worked field pupils aristotle theophrastus eudemus investigated hypothetical syllogisms chrysippus developed these principles coherent system propositional logic
propositions chrysippus defined proposition capable being denied affirmed itself gave examples propositions such day dion walking
distinguished simple non-simple propositions modern terminology known atomic molecular propositions
simple proposition elementary statement such day
simple propositions linked together form non-simple propositions use logical connectives
chrysippus enumerated five kinds molecular propositions according connective used logical connectives type example day light day light either
either day night because because day light more/less likely
likely day night thus several types molecular propositions familiar modern logic listed chrysippus including conjunction disjunction conditional chrysippus studied their criteria truth closely
conditional propositions first logicians debate conditional statements diodorus cronus pupil philo
writing five-hundred years later sextus empiricus refers debate diodorus philo
philo regarded conditionals true except those correct antecedent incorrect consequent meant proposition such day then am talking true unless day fall silent
diodorus argued true conditional antecedent clause never lead untrue conclusion thus because proposition day then am talking false invalid
however paradoxical propositions still possible such atomic elements things exist atomic elements exists
chrysippus adopted much stricter view regarding conditional propositions made such paradoxes impossible conditional true denial consequent logically incompatible antecedent
corresponds modern-day strict conditional
syllogistic chrysippus developed syllogistic system deduction made use five types basic arguments argument forms called indemonstrable syllogisms played role axioms four inference rules called themata means complex syllogisms reduced these axioms
forms five indemonstrables name description example modus ponens then

four inference rules two survived
so-called first thema rule antilogism
other third thema cut rule chain syllogisms reduced simple syllogisms
purpose stoic syllogistic merely create formal system
also understood study operations reason divine reason logos governs universe human beings part
goal find valid rules inference forms proof help people find their way life
other logical work chrysippus analyzed speech handling names terms
also devoted much effort refuting fallacies paradoxes
according diogenes laërtius chrysippus twelve works 23 books liar paradox seven works 17 books amphiboly another nine works books other conundrums
28 works 66 books given over puzzles paradoxes
chrysippus first stoic whom third four stoic categories
category somehow disposed attested
surviving evidence chrysippus frequently makes use categories substance quality makes little use other two stoic categories somehow disposed somehow disposed relation something
clear whether categories any special significance chrysippus clear doctrine categories may work later stoics
later reception chrysippus came renowned foremost logicians ancient greece
clement alexandria wanted mention master among logicians homer master among poets chrysippus aristotle chose
diogenes laërtius gods use dialectic use none other chrysippus
logical work chrysippus came neglected forgotten
aristotle's logic prevailed partly because seen practical partly because taken up neoplatonists
recently 19 th century stoic logic treated contempt barren formulaic system merely clothing logic aristotle new terminology
until 20 th century advances logic modern propositional calculus became clear stoic logic constituted significant achievement
epistemology stoics truth distinguished error sage possesses right reason
chrysippus's theory knowledge empirical
senses transmit messages external world their reports controlled referring them innate ideas comparing them previous reports stored mind
zeno defined impressions sense impression soul interpreted literally cleanthes compared impression soul impression made seal wax
chrysippus preferred regard alteration change soul soul receives modification every external object acts upon just air receives countless strokes many people speaking once
receipt impression soul purely passive impression reveals own existence also cause—just light displays itself elements
power name object resides understanding
first must come impression understanding—having power utterance—expresses speech affection receives object
true presentations distinguished those false use memory classification comparison
sense organ mind healthy—and provided external object really seen heard—the presentation due clearness distinctness power extort assent lies our power give withhold
context people understood rational beings reason developed out these notions
physics chrysippus insisted organic unity universe well correlation mutual interdependence parts
universe own soul own controlling mind
following zeno chrysippus determined fiery breath aether primitive substance universe
objects made up inert formless matter informing soul pneuma provides form undifferentiated matter
pneuma pervades substance maintains unity universe constitutes soul—the incorporeal many conceptions immortal essence person living thing—of human being
classical elements change another process condensation rarefaction
fire first becomes solidified air then air water lastly water earth
process dissolution takes place reverse order earth being rarefied water water air air fire
human soul divided chrysippus eight faculties five senses power reproduction power speech ruling part located chest rather head
individual souls perishable according view originated chrysippus souls wise people survive longer after their death
no individual soul however survive beyond periodic conflagration universe renewed
fate chrysippus things happen according fate seems accidental hidden cause
unity world consists chain-like dependence cause upon cause
nothing take place without sufficient cause
according chrysippus every proposition either true false must apply future events well any motion exists without cause then every proposition will either true false
efficient causes neither true nor false
every proposition either true false
therefore there no motion without cause
then effects owe their existence prior causes
things happen fate
follows therefore whatever happens happens fate
stoic view fate entirely based view universe whole
individual things persons come consideration dependent parts whole
everything every respect determined relation consequently subject general order world
opponents objected everything determined destiny there no individual responsibility since once foreordained must happen come may chrysippus replied there distinction made simple complex predestination
becoming ill may fated whatever happens person's recovery linked consulting doctor then consulting doctor fated occur together person's recovery becomes complex fact
human actions fact our destiny decided our relation things chrysippus put events co-fated occur non-destruction one's coat says fated simply co-fated being taken care someone's being saved enemies co-fated fleeing those enemies having children co-fated being willing lie woman
many things cannot occur without our being willing indeed contributing most strenuous eagerness zeal these things since says fated these things occur conjunction personal effort
will our power says our power being included fate
thus our actions predetermined causally related overarching network fate nevertheless moral responsibility how respond impressions remains our own
all-determining power active everywhere working each particular being according nature whether rational irrational creatures inorganic objects
every action brought co-operation causes depending nature things character agent
our actions involuntary produced external causes alone without any co-operation part our wills external causes
virtue vice set down things our power consequently responsible
moral responsibility depends freedom will emanates our will our own no matter whether possible us act differently
rather subtle position attempts reconcile determinism human responsibility known soft-determinism compatibilism
divination cleromancy ancient greece
chrysippus accepted divination part causal chain fate
chrysippus also argued existence fate based divination thought there good evidence
possible diviners predict future future itself accidental
omens portents believed natural symptoms certain occurrences
there must countless indications course providence most part unobserved meaning few having become known humanity
those argued divination superfluous events foreordained replied both divination our behaviour under warnings affords included chain causation
god stoics believed universe god chrysippus affirmed universe itself god universal outpouring soul
guiding principle universe operating mind reason together common nature things totality embraces existence
based these beliefs physicist philosopher max bernhard weinstein identified chrysippus pandeist
chrysippus sought prove existence god making use teleological argument there anything humanity cannot produce being produces better humanity
humanity cannot produce things universe heavenly bodies etc
being therefore produces them superior humanity
there superior humanity except god? therefore god exists
chrysippus spoke god gods interchangeably
interpreted gods traditional greek religion viewing them different aspects reality
cicero tells us further maintained aether people call zeus air permeates seas poseidon earth known name demeter treated similar style names other gods
addition universe exists benefit universal god should infer case beautiful dwelling-place built owners mice ought therefore same way regard universe dwelling-place gods
theodicy response question how evil exist good universe chrysippus replied evil cannot removed nor well should removed
firstly argued following plato impossible good exist without evil justice known without injustice courage without cowardice temperance without intemperance wisdom without foolishness
secondly apparent evils exist consequent nature's goodness thus necessary human skull made small thin bones reasons utility superior utility meant skull vulnerable blows
thirdly evils distributed according rational will zeus either punish wicked because important world-order whole
thus evil good under disguise ultimately conducive best
chrysippus compared evil coarse jest comedy just jest though offensive itself improves piece whole too you may criticize evil regarded itself yet allow taken else use
mathematics puzzle democritus
cone sliced horizontally surfaces produced equal unequal? chrysippus regarded bodies surfaces lines places void time being infinitely divisible
determined principal features infinite set since man finger infinite number parts universe man cannot man parts finger nor universe parts man
chrysippus also responded problem first posed democritus
cone divided plane parallel base surfaces segments equal unequal? equal then cone becomes cylinder unequal then surface cone must stepped
reply chrysippus surfaces both equal unequal
chrysippus effect negating law excluded middle respect equal unequal thus may anticipated important principle modern infinitesimal calculus namely limit process convergence towards limit
chrysippus notable claiming number
considered number ancient greeks since viewed things measured
aristotle metaphysics
measure things measured measure beginning number
chrysippus asserted magnitude greek πλῆθος ἕν although generally accepted greeks iamblichus magnitude contradiction terms
ethics greek amphora depicting euripides' medea
chrysippus regarded medea prime example how bad judgments give rise irrational passions
chrysippus taught ethics depended physics
physical theses stated there no other appropriate way approaching subject good evil virtues happiness nature things administration universe
goal life chrysippus live accordance one's experience actual course nature
person's individual nature part nature whole universe thus life should lived accordance one's own human nature well universe
human nature ethical humanity akin divine emanating primal fire aether though material embodiment reason people should conduct themselves accordingly
people freedom freedom consists emancipation irrational desires lust riches position life domination etc
subjecting will reason
chrysippus laid greatest stress worth dignity individual power will
stoics admitted good bad third class things indifferent adiaphora
things morally indifferent best includes health riches honour worst includes sickness poverty
chrysippus accepted normal ordinary usage refer preferred indifferent things good wise person chrysippus uses such things without requiring them
practice habit necessary render virtue perfect individual other words there such thing moral progress character built up
stoics sought free unruly emotions regarded being contrary nature
passions emotions pathe disturbing element right judgment
chrysippus whole book concerning therapy emotions
passions like diseases depress crush soul thus sought eradicate them apatheia
wrong judgements turn passions gather impetus their own just started running difficult stop
cannot hope eradicate emotions heat love anger done calm
therefore should prepare advance deal emotions mind present
applying reason emotions such greed pride lust understand harm cause
