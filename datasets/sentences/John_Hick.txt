while university birmingham hick played important roles number organizations centered community relations
non-christian communities mostly hindu muslim sikh begun form central england community immigration caribbean islands indian subcontinent increased
due influx peoples different religious traditions organizations focused integrating community became necessary

also held teaching positions cornell university princeton theological seminary cambridge university
during teaching stay princeton seminary hick began depart conservative religious standings began question whether belief incarnation required believe literal historicity virgin birth
questioning open door further examination own christology contribute hick's understanding religious pluralism

hick delivered 1986–87 gifford lectures awarded prestigious grawemeyer award university louisville louisville presbyterian theological seminary religion
hick twice subject heresy proceedings
1961 1962 asked whether took exception anything westminster confession 1647 answered several points open question
because local ministers appealed against reception presbytery
their appeal sustained synod
year later counter-appeal sustained judicial committee general assembly hick became member presbytery see christian heresy 20 th century
hick's philosophy robert smid states hick regularly cited most simply most significant philosopher religion twentieth century
keith ward once described greatest living philosopher global religion
best known advocacy religious pluralism radically different traditional christian teachings held younger
perhaps because heavy involvement inter-faith groups mentioned above under career heading interaction people non-christian faiths through those groups hick began move toward pluralistic outlook religion
notes both way? god universe faiths came know these people belonged non-christian faiths saw them same values moral actions recognized fellow christians
observation led begin questioning how completely loving god possibly sentence non-christians clearly espouse values revered christianity eternity hell
hick then began attempt uncover means those devoted theistic religion might receive salvation
hick notably criticized then-cardinal joseph ratzinger held position pope emeritus 2005-2013 head holy office
ratzinger examined works several theologians accused relativism such jacques dupuis roger haight found many philosophically inspired hick
therefore declaration dominus iesus seen many time condemnation hick's ideas theories
kantian influences having begun career evangelical moved towards pluralism way reconciling god’s love facts cultural religious diversity
primarily influenced immanuel kant regard argued human minds obscure actual reality favor comprehension see kant's theory perception
according richard peters hick [the] construal relationship human mind god
much like relationship kant supposed exists human mind world
isn't fair say hick strictly kantian however
peters notes divide 'noumenal' 'phenomenal' realms far nature concerned nearly severe hick kant
hick also declares divine being calls 'transcategorial'
experience god through categories god himself obscures them very nature
pluralism light kantian influences hick claims knowledge real generic term transcendent reality known being perceived
reason absolute truth claims god use christian language really truth claims perceptions god claims phenomenal god noumenal god
furthermore because knowledge rooted experience then perceived interpreted human categories conception cultural historical contexts inevitably influence human perception necessarily components knowledge real
means knowledge god religious truth claims pertaining thereof culturally historically influenced reason should considered absolute
significant aspect hick's argument against christian exclusivism holds although other religions might contain partial goodness truth salvation provided jesus christ complete truth god contained christianity
perhaps simplest manner understand hick's theory pluralism religions share comparison makes own understanding religion copernican view our solar system
before copernicus disseminated views solar centered universe ptolemaic system ruled stars painted sky sun rose set around earth
short rest universe existed centered our little planet
other hand copernicus asserted earth other planets well circled sun fact move appeared move due revolution our planet
copernicus introduced our world understanding other planets took similar paths around sun while each path differed served same purpose generated same result every planet makes full path around our central star
rotation planet axis creates day night planet just day night occur earth
although time frames full trip around sun full day-night cycle differs planet-by-planet basis concept remains constant throughout our solar system
similarly hick draws metaphor ptolemaic view religion christianity way true salvation knowledge true god
ptolemaic christianity assert everything exists history played out specific patterns glory christian god there no other possible path will lead salvation
hick appears copernicus offering belief perhaps theistic religions focused toward true god simply take different paths achieve same goal
speaker religious pluralism keith e
johnson compares hick's pluralistic theology tale three blind men attempting describe elephant touching leg second touching trunk third feeling elephant's side
each man describes elephant differently although each accurate each also convinced their own correctness mistakenness other two
robert smid states hick believes tenets christianity no longer feasible present age must effectively 'lowered'
moreover mark mann notes hick argues there people throughout history exemplars real
hick's position exclusively christian inclusivism [like karl rahner ‘anonymous christian’] plurality mutually inclusive inclusivism
hick contends diverse religious expressions religions result diverse historically culturally influenced responses diverse perceptions real
states different religious traditions their complex internal differentiations developed meet needs range mentalities expressed different human cultures
hick's christology god universe faiths hick attempts pinpoint essence christianity
first cites sermon mount being basic christian teaching provides practical way living out christian faith
says christian essence found beliefs god
living disciples name feed hungry heal sick create justice world
however teachings including sermon mount form hick calls essence christianity flow directly jesus' ministry
turn means birth life death resurrection jesus form permanent basis christian tradition
hick continues work examine manner deification jesus took place corporate christianity following crucifixion questions whether jesus actually thought himself messiah literal son god
several places e
contributions metaphor god incarnate book myth god incarnate hick proposes reinterpretation traditional christology—particularly doctrine incarnation
hick contends historical jesus nazareth teach apparently believe god god son second person holy trinity incarnate son god unique sense
reason perhaps sake religious pluralism peace hick proposes metaphorical approach incarnation
jesus example literally god flesh incarnate metaphorically speaking presence god
jesus open divine inspiration responsive divine spirit obedient god's will god able act earth through
hick believe true christian doctrine incarnation
hick believes metaphorical view incarnation avoids need faulty christian paradoxes such duality christ fully god fully human even trinity god simultaneously three
neither intense christological debates centuries leading up council chalcedon nor renewed christological debates 19 th 20 th centuries succeeded squaring circle making intelligible claim genuinely unambiguously man also genuinely unambiguously god
problem evil hick identified branch theodicy calls irenaean theodicy soul-making defense
simplification view states suffering exists means spiritual development
other words god allows suffering human souls might grow develop towards maturation
hick god ultimately responsible pain suffering such things truly bad
perhaps greater degree perception see evil experience through suffering ultimately evil good such used make our souls better
therefore hick sees evils pain suffering serving god’s good purpose bringing imperfect immature humanity itself uncompelled faith love
same time hick acknowledges process often fails our world
however after-life hick asserts god will eventually succeed purpose winning men himself
discussion evil hick challenged number theologians moral philosophers including david griffin john k
using hick's own words roth stated hick's theodicy implausible me because am convinced claims god's goodness cannot stand onslaught calls principal threat own perspective 'the sheer amount intensity both moral natural evil
book encountering evil stephen davis stated four criticisms hick first while no theodicy free difficulties believe hick's entirely convincing handling amount evil exists world
second am dubious hick's hope gradual spiritual evolution till human beings reach full state god-consciousness
third believe hick also faces call 'cost-effective' criticism free will defense
my final most serious criticism hick concerns commitment universalism
