while meanings words often change result cultural developments baumgarten's reappraisal aesthetics often seen key moment development aesthetic philosophy
previously word aesthetics merely meant sensibility responsiveness stimulation senses use ancient writers
development art commercial enterprise linked rise nouveau riche class across europe purchasing art inevitably lead question good art?
baumgarten developed aesthetics mean study good bad taste thus good bad art linking good taste beauty
trying develop idea good bad taste also turn generated philosophical debate around new meaning aesthetics
without there no basis aesthetic debate there no objective criterion basis comparison reason develop objective argument
views aesthetics aesthetica 1750 alexander gottlieb baumgarten baumgarten appropriated word aesthetics meant sensation mean taste sense beauty
doing gave word different significance thereby inventing modern usage
word used differently since time ancient greeks mean ability receive stimulation five bodily senses
metaphysic § 451 baumgarten defined taste wider meaning ability judge according senses instead according intellect
such judgment taste saw based feelings pleasure displeasure
science aesthetics baumgarten deduction rules principles artistic natural beauty individual taste
baumgarten may motivated respond pierre bonhours' opinion published pamphlet late 17 th century germans incapable appreciating art beauty
reception 1781 kant declared baumgarten's aesthetics never contain objective rules laws principles natural artistic beauty
germans people presently 1781 come use word aesthetic[s] designate others call critique taste
doing basis false hope conceived superb analyst baumgarten
hoped bring our critical judging beautiful under rational principles raise rules such judging level lawful science
yet endeavor futile
far their principal sources concerned those supposed rules criteria merely empirical
hence never serve determinate priori laws our judgment taste must conform
rather our judgment taste constitutes proper test correctness those rules criteria
because advisable follow either two alternatives
these stop using new name aesthetic[s] sense critique taste reserve name aesthetic[s] doctrine sensibility true science
doing also come closer language ancients meaning
among ancients division cognition aisthētá kai noētá [sensed thought] quite famous
other alternative new aesthetic[s] share name speculative philosophy
then take name partly transcendental meaning partly psychological meaning
critique pure reason note
nine years later critique judgment kant conformed baumgarten's new usage employed word aesthetic mean judgment taste estimation beautiful
kant aesthetic judgment subjective relates internal feeling pleasure displeasure any qualities external object
1897 leo tolstoy art? criticized baumgarten's book aesthetics
tolstoy opposed baumgarten's trinity — good truth beauty…
tolstoy asserted these words no definite meaning hinder us giving any definite meaning existing art…
baumgarten claimed there three ways know perfection beauty perfect absolute perceived senses
truth perfect perceived reason
good perfect attained moral will
tolstoy however contradicted baumgarten's theory claimed good truth beauty nothing common may even oppose each other
…the arbitrary uniting these three concepts served basis astonishing theory according difference good art conveying good feelings bad art conveying wicked feelings totally obliterated lowest manifestations art art mere pleasure…came regarded highest art
art became important thing intended empty amusement idle people
