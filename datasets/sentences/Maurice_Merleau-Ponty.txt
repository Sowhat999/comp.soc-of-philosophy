thought consciousness phenomenology perception first published french 1945 merleau-ponty developed concept body-subject alternative cartesian cogito
distinction especially important merleau-ponty perceives essences world existentially
consciousness world human body perceiving thing intricately intertwined mutually engaged
phenomenal thing unchanging object natural sciences correlate our body sensory-motor functions
taking up communing merleau-ponty's phrase sensible qualities encounters body incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within ever-present world frame through use pre-conscious prepredicative understanding world's makeup
elaboration however inexhaustible hallmark any perception according merleau-ponty
things upon our body grip prise while grip itself function our connaturality world's things
world sense self emergent phenomena ongoing becoming
essential partiality our view things their being given certain perspective certain moment time does diminish their reality contrary establishes there no other way things copresent us other things through such abschattungen sketches faint outlines adumbrations
thing transcends our view manifest precisely presenting itself range possible views
object perception immanently tied background—to nexus meaningful relations among objects within world
because object inextricably within world meaningful relations each object reflects other much style leibniz's monads
through involvement world being-in-the-world perceiver tacitly experiences perspectives upon object coming surrounding things environment well potential perspectives object upon beings around
each object mirror others
our perception object through perspectives propositional clearly delineated perception
rather ambiguous perception founded upon body's primordial involvement understanding world meanings constitute landscape's perceptual gestalt
after integrated within environment perceive objects such turn our attention toward particular objects within landscape define them clearly
attention however does operate clarifying already seen constructing new gestalt oriented toward particular object
because our bodily involvement things provisional indeterminate encounter meaningful things unified though ever open-ended world
primacy perception time writing structure behavior phenomenology perception merleau-ponty wanted show opposition idea drove tradition beginning john locke perception causal product atomic sensations
atomist-causal conception being perpetuated certain psychological currents time particularly behaviourism
according merleau-ponty perception active dimension primordial openness lifeworld lebenswelt
primordial openness heart thesis primacy perception
slogan phenomenology edmund husserl consciousness consciousness something implies distinction acts thought noesis intentional objects thought noema
thus correlation noesis noema becomes first step constitution analyses consciousness
however studying posthumous manuscripts husserl remained major influences merleau-ponty remarked their evolution husserl's work brings light phenomena assimilable noesis–noema correlation
particularly case attends phenomena body once body-subject body-object subjective time consciousness time neither act consciousness nor object thought other first considerations other husserl led solipsism
distinction acts thought noesis intentional objects thought noema does seem therefore constitute irreducible ground
appears rather higher level analysis
thus merleau-ponty does postulate consciousness consciousness something supposes outset noetic-noematic ground
instead develops thesis according consciousness perceptual consciousness
doing establishes significant turn development phenomenology indicating conceptualisations should re-examined light primacy perception weighing up philosophical consequences thesis
corporeity rené descartes taking study perception point departure merleau-ponty led recognize one's own body le corps propre thing potential object study science also permanent condition experience constituent perceptual openness world
therefore underlines fact there inherence consciousness body analysis perception should take account
primacy perception signifies primacy experience speak insofar perception becomes active constitutive dimension
merleau-ponty demonstrates corporeity consciousness much intentionality body stands contrast dualist ontology mind body rené descartes philosopher whom merleau-ponty continually returned despite important differences separate them
phenomenology perception merleau-ponty “insofar hands feet body sustain around me intentions dependent my decisions affect my surroundings way choose” 1962 p
question concerning corporeity connects also merleau-ponty's reflections space l'espace primacy dimension depth profondeur implied notion being world être au monde echo heidegger's in-der-welt-sein one's own body le corps propre
language highlighting fact corporeity intrinsically dimension expressivity proves fundamental constitution ego conclusions structure behavior constantly reiterated merleau-ponty's later works
following theme expressivity goes examine how incarnate subject position undertake actions transcend organic level body such intellectual operations products one's cultural life
ferdinand de saussure carefully considers language then core culture examining particular connections unfolding thought sense — enriching perspective analysis acquisition language expressivity body also taking account pathologies language painting cinema literature poetry song
work deals mainly language beginning reflection artistic expression structure behavior — contains passage el greco p
203 ff prefigures remarks develops cézanne's doubt 1945 follows discussion phenomenology perception

course outlines sorbonne lectures indicate during period continues dialogue phenomenology diverse work carried out psychology order return study acquisition language children well broadly take advantage contribution ferdinand de saussure linguistics work notion structure through discussion work psychology linguistics social anthropology
art attention merleau-ponty pays diverse forms art visual plastic literary poetic etc
should attributed concern beauty per se
nor work attempt elaborate normative criteria art
thus does find work theoretical attempt discern constitutes major work work art even handicraft
while does establish any normative criteria art such there nonetheless work prevalent distinction primary secondary modes expression
distinction appears phenomenology perception p

sometimes repeated terms spoken speaking language le langage parlé et le langage parlant prose world p
spoken language le langage parlé secondary expression returns our linguistic baggage cultural heritage acquired well brute mass relationships signs significations
speaking language le langage parlant primary expression such language production sense language advent thought moment makes itself advent sense
speaking language say primary expression interests merleau-ponty keeps attention through treatment nature production reception expressions subject also overlaps analysis action intentionality perception well links freedom external conditions
notion style occupies important place indirect language voices silence
spite certain similarities andré malraux merleau-ponty distinguishes himself malraux respect three conceptions style last employed malraux's voices silence
merleau-ponty remarks work style sometimes used malraux highly subjective sense understood projection artist's individuality
sometimes used contrary very metaphysical sense merleau-ponty's opinion mystical sense style connected conception über-artist expressing spirit painting
finally sometimes reduced simply designating categorization artistic school movement
however account malraux's notion style—a key element thinking—is open serious question
merleau-ponty these uses notion style lead malraux postulate cleavage objectivity italian renaissance painting subjectivity painting own time conclusion merleau-ponty disputes
according merleau-ponty important consider heart problematic recognizing style first demand owed primacy perception also implies taking consideration dimensions historicity intersubjectivity
however merleau-ponty's reading malraux questioned recent major study malraux's theory art argues merleau-ponty seriously misunderstood malraux
merleau-ponty style born interaction two fields being
rather being exclusive individual human consciousness consciousness born pre-conscious style world nature
science essay cézanne's doubt identifies cézanne's impressionistic theory painting analogous own concept radical reflection attempt return reflect prereflective consciousness merleau-ponty identifies science opposite art
merleau-ponty's account whereas art attempt capture individual's perception science anti-individualistic
preface phenomenology perception merleau-ponty presents phenomenological objection positivism tell us nothing human subjectivity
scientific text explain particular individual experience scientist cannot transcended
merleau-ponty science neglects depth profundity phenomena endeavors explain
merleau-ponty understood science ex post facto abstraction
causal physiological accounts perception example explain perception terms arrived after abstracting phenomenon itself
merleau-ponty chastised science taking itself area complete account nature may given
subjective depth phenomena cannot given science

influence anticognitivist cognitive science merleau-ponty's critical position respect science stated preface phenomenology— described scientific points view both naive same time dishonest
despite perhaps because view work influenced anticipated strands modern psychology known post-cognitivism
hubert dreyfus instrumental emphasising relevance maurice merleau-ponty's work current post-cognitive research criticism traditional view cognitive science
dreyfus's seminal critique cognitivism computational account mind computers can't consciously replays merleau-ponty's critique intellectualist psychology argue irreducibility corporeal know-how discrete syntactic processes

feminist philosophy merleau-ponty also picked up australian nordic philosophers inspired french feminist tradition including rosalyn diprose sara heinämaa fi
rosalyn diprose's recent work takes advantage merleau-ponty's conception intercorporeity indistinction perspectives critique individualistic identity politics feminist perspective ground irreducibility generosity virtue generosity dual sense giving being given
[citation needed] sara heinämaa argued rereading merleau-ponty's influence simone de beauvoir
she also challenged hubert dreyfus's reading merleau-ponty behaviorist[citation needed] neglecting importance phenomenological reduction merleau-ponty's thought
merleau-ponty's phenomenology body also taken up iris young her renowned essay throwing like girl follow-up 'throwing like girl' twenty years later
young analyzes particular modalities feminine bodily comportment differ men
young observes while man throws ball puts whole body motion woman throwing ball generally restricts her own movements she makes them generally sports women move tentative reactive way
merleau-ponty argues experience world terms oriented towards certain projects based our capacity habituality
young's thesis women intentionality inhibited ambivalent rather confident experienced cannot

david abram explains merleau-ponty's concept flesh chair mysterious tissue matrix underlies gives rise both perceiver perceived interdependent aspects spontaneous activity identifies elemental matrix interdependent web earthly life
concept unites subject object dialectically determinations within primordial reality merleau-ponty calls flesh abram refers variously animate earth breathing biosphere more-than-human natural world
yet nature biosphere conceived complex set objects objective processes rather biosphere experienced lived within intelligent body — attentive human animal entirely part world she experiences
merleau-ponty's ecophenemonology emphasis holistic dialog within larger-than-human world also implications ontogenesis phylogenesis language indeed states language very voice trees waves forest
merleau-ponty himself refers primordial being yet subject-being nor object-being every respect baffles reflection
primordial being us there no derivation nor any break
among many working notes found desk time death published half-complete manuscript visible invisible several make evident merleau-ponty himself recognized deep affinity notion primordial flesh radically transformed understanding nature
hence november 1960 writes psychoanalysis nature flesh mother
