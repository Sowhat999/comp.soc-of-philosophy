inspired work blake frye developed articulated unified theory ten years after fearful symmetry anatomy criticism 1957
described attempt synoptic view scope theory principles techniques literary criticism anatomy 3
asked criticism science well art? 7 thus frye launched pursuit occupy rest career—that establishing criticism coherent field study trains imagination quite systematically efficiently sciences train reason hamilton 34
criticism science
hamilton outlines northrop frye anatomy criticism frye's assumption coherence literary criticism carries important implications
firstly most fundamentally presupposes literary criticism discipline own right independent literature
claiming john stuart mill artist
heard overheard frye insists axiom criticism must poet does know talking cannot talk knows
defend right criticism exist therefore assume criticism structure thought knowledge existing own right measure independence art deals anatomy 5
declaration independence hart xv necessarily measured frye
coherence requires autonomy criticism need eradicate conception parasitic form literary expression
second-hand imitation creative power anatomy 3 sits dynamic tension need establish integrity discipline
frye kind coherent critical integrity involves claiming body knowledge criticism while independent literature yet constrained criticism exists declares must examination literature terms conceptual framework derivable inductive survey literary field itself anatomy 7
frye's conceptual framework literature seeking integrity criticism frye rejects termed deterministic fallacy
defines movement scholar special interest geography economics [to] express
interest rhetorical device putting favorite study causal relationship whatever interests less anatomy 6
attaching criticism external framework rather locating framework criticism within literature kind critic essentially substitute[s] critical attitude criticism
frye critical integrity means axioms postulates criticism
grow out art deals anatomy 6
northrop frye hall university toronto taking cue aristotle frye's methodology defining conceptual framework begins inductively follow[ing] natural order begin[ning] primary facts anatomy 15
primary facts case works literature themselves
frye's inductive survey these facts reveal? significantly revealed general tendency part great classics revert [primitive formulas] anatomy 17
revelation prompted next move rather 'inductive leap' suggest time criticism leap new ground discover organizing containing forms conceptual framework
criticism seems badly need coordinating principle central hypothesis like theory evolution biology will see phenomena deals parts whole anatomy 16
arguing criticism cannot systematic [and thus scientific] study unless there quality literature enables frye puts forward hypothesis just there order nature behind natural sciences literature piled aggregate 'works' order words anatomy 17
order words constitutes criticism's conceptual framework coordinating principle
order words recurring primitive formulas frye noticed survey greatest classics provide literature order words skeleton allows reader respond imaginatively any literary work seeing larger perspective provided literary social contexts hamilton 20
frye identifies these formulas conventional myths metaphors calls archetypes spiritus mundi 118
archetypes literature exist frye argues order words providing criticism conceptual framework body knowledge derived ideological system rooted imagination itself
thus rather interpreting literary works ideological 'position' — frye calls superimposed critical attitude anatomy 7 — criticism instead finds integrity within literary field itself
criticism frye then task evaluation — rejecting accepting literary work — rather simply recognizing understanding relation other works within 'order words' cotrupi 4
imposing value judgments literature belongs according frye history taste therefore follows vacillations fashionable prejudice anatomy 9
genuine criticism progresses toward making whole literature intelligible anatomy 9 goal ultimately knowledge evaluation
critic frye's mode then
literary work should contemplated pattern knowledge act must distinguished least initially any direct experience work
[thus] criticism begins reading ends no longer imaginatively subjected literary work critic tries make sense out going historical context commenting immediate experience reading seeing structure within literature literature within culture hamilton 27
theory imagination once asked whether critical theory romantic frye responded oh it's entirely romantic yes stingle
romantic same sense frye attributed romanticism blake expanded sense giving primary place imagination individual feeling stingle 2
artifacts imagination literary works including pre-literary categories ritual myth folk-tale archetypes 1450 form frye's vision potentially unified imaginative experience
reminds us literature central most important extension mythology
every human society possesses mythology inherited transmitted diversified literature words power xiii
mythology literature thus inhabit function within same imaginative world governed conventions own modes symbols myths genres hart 23
integrity criticism requires too operates within sphere imagination seek organizing principle ideology
claims frye
leaves out central structural principles literature derives myth principles give literature communicating power across centuries through ideological changes
such structural principles certainly conditioned social historical factors transcend them retain continuity form points identity literary organism distinct adaptations social environment words power xiii
myth therefore provides structure literature simply because literature whole displaced mythology bates 21
hart makes point well states frye story argument centre literature society
base society mythical narrative ideological dialectical 19
idea central frye's criticism first suggested giambattista vico
frye's critical method frye uses terms 'centripetal' 'centrifugal' describe critical method
criticism frye explains essentially centripetal moves inwardly towards structure text centrifugal moves outwardly away text towards society outer world
lyric poetry instance like keats's ode grecian urn dominantly centripetal stressing sound movement imagery ordered words
rhetorical novels like uncle tom's cabin dominantly centrifugal stressing thematic connection stories characters social order
ode centrifugal tendencies relying effects elements history pottery visual aesthetics
cabin centripetal tendencies relying syntax lexical choice delineate characters establish mood
veers inward other pushes outward
criticism reflects these movements centripetally focusing aesthetic function literature centrifugally social function literature
while critics schools criticism emphasize movement over other frye both movements essential criticism will two aspects turned toward structure literature turned toward other cultural phenomena form social environment literature critical path 25
therefore agree least part new critics day their centripetal insistence structural analysis
frye part story right declares first effort critical apprehension should take form rhetorical structural analysis work art
purely structural approach same limitation criticism biology
doesn't develop any explanation how structure came nearest relatives
structural analysis brings rhetoric back criticism need new poetics well
archetypes 1447
archetypal criticism new poetics frye new poetics found principle mythological framework come known 'archetypal criticism'
through lens framework essentially centrifugal movement backing up text towards archetype social function literary criticism becomes apparent
essentially criticism according frye awaken students successive levels awareness mythology lies behind ideology their society indoctrinates them stingle 4
study recurring structural patterns grants students emancipatory distance their own society gives them vision higher human state — longinian sublime — accessible directly through their own experience ultimately transforms expands their experience poetic model becomes model live
terms kerygmatic mode myths become myths live metaphors metaphors live
work us constantly expand our horizons [so that] may enter world [kerygma transformative power] pass others found true ourselves double vision 18
because important social function frye felt literary criticism essential part liberal education worked tirelessly communicate ideas wider audience
many years now 1987 addressing myself primarily other critics students nonspecialist public realizing whatever new directions come my discipline will come their needs their intense unfocused vision auguries 7
therefore fitting last book published posthumously should describes being something shorter accessible version longer books great code words power asks readers read sympathetically proceeding judgment seat final conviction rest stop pilgrimage however near pilgrimage may now close double vision preface
see also archetypal literary criticism influences vico blake vico new science posited view language fundamentally figurative introduced enlightenment discourse notion role imagination creating meaning
vico poetic discourse prior philosophical discourse philosophy fact derivative poetry
frye readily acknowledged debt owed vico developing literary theory describing first modern thinker understand major verbal structures descended historically poetic mythological ones words power xii
however blake frye's virgilian guide stingle first awakened frye mythological frame our culture cotrupi 14
fact frye claims second book [anatomy] contained embryo first [fearful symmetry] stubborn structure 160
reflecting similarity blake milton frye first stumbled upon principle mythological framework recognition bible mythological framework cosmos body stories societies live within mythology hart 18
blake thus led frye conviction bible provided western societies mythology informed western literature
hamilton asserts blake's claim 'the old new testaments great code art' became central doctrine [frye's] criticism 39
'doctrine' found fullest expression frye's appropriately named great code described preliminary investigation biblical structure typology whose purpose ultimately suggest how structure bible revealed narrative imagery related conventions genres western literature words power xi
