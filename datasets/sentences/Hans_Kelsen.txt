1908 kelsen won research scholarship allowed attend university heidelberg three consecutive semesters studied distinguished jurist georg jellinek before returning vienna
closing chapter kelsen's study political allegory dante also important emphasizing particular historical path led directly development modern law twentieth century
after emphasizing dante's importance development legal theory kelsen then indicated historical importance niccolò machiavelli jean bodin these historical transitions legal theory leading modern twentieth century law
case machiavelli kelsen saw important counter-example exaggerated executive part government operating without effective legal restraints responsible conduct
kelsen instrumental orientation own legal thinking direction strong rule law government heightened emphasis central importance fully elaborated power judicial review
kelsen's time heidelberg lasting importance began solidify position identity law state initial steps observed being taken jellinek
kelsen's historical reality surrounded dualistic theories law state prevailing time
major question jellinek kelsen stated baume how independence state dualist perspective reconciled status representative legal order? dualistic theorists there remains alternative monistic doctrines theory self-limitation state
georg jellinek eminent representative theory allows avoid reducing state legal entity also explain positive relationship law state
self-limitation sphere state presupposes state sovereign power limits imposes itself becomes rule-of-law state
kelsen appropriate far went yet still remained dualistic doctrine therefore kelsen rejected stating problem so-called auto-obligation state those pseudo-problems result erroneous dualism state law
dualism turn due fallacy meet numerous examples history fields human thought
our desire intuitive representation abstractions leads us personify unity system then hypostasize personification
originally way representing unity system objects becomes new object existing own right
kelsen joined critique distinguished french jurist léon duguit 1911 self-limitation theory vis jellinek contains real sleight hand
voluntary subordination subordination
state really limited law state alone introduce write law any time make any changes wants make

during 1920 s kelsen continued promote celebrated theory identity law state made efforts counterpoint position carl schmitt advocated priority political concerns state
kelsen supported position adolf merkl alfred verdross while opposition view voiced erich kaufman hermann heller rudolf smend
important part kelsen's main practical legacy inventor modern european model constitutional review
first introduced both austria czechoslovakia 1920 then latter federal republic germany italy spain portugal later many countries central eastern europe
described above kelsenian court model set up separate constitutional court sole responsibility over constitutional disputes within judicial system
kelsen primary author statutes state constitution austria documents 1923 book cited above
different system usual common-law countries including usa courts general jurisdiction trial level up court last resort frequently powers constitutional review
following increasing political controversy positions constitutional court austria kelsen faced increasing pressure administration appointed specifically address issues cases concerning providence divorce provisions state family law
kelsen inclined liberal interpretation divorce provision while administration originally appointed responding public pressure predominantly catholic country take conservative position issue curtailment divorce
increasingly conservative climate kelsen considered social democrat liberal inclinations although party member removed court 1930
kelsen european years 1930 1940 her recent book kelsen sandrine baume summarized confrontation kelsen schmitt very start 1930 s
debate reignite kelsen's strong defense principle judicial review against principle authoritarian version executive branch government schmitt envisioned national socialism germany
kelsen scathing reply schmitt 1931 essay should guardian constitution? defended plain terms importance judicial review over against excessive form executive authoritarian government schmitt promulgating early 1930 s
baume states kelsen defended legitimacy constitutional court combating reasons schmitt cites assigning role guardian constitution president reich
dispute these two lawyers body state should assigned role guardian german constitution
kelsen thought mission ought conferred judiciary especially constitutional court
although kelsen successful drafting sections constitution austria strong court judicial review sympathizers germany less successful
both heinrich trielpel 1924 gerhard anschutz 1926 unsuccessful their explicit drive instill strong version judicial review germany's weimar constitution
kelsen accepted professorship university cologne 1930
national socialists came power germany 1933 removed post moved geneva switzerland taught international law graduate institute international studies 1934 1940
during time period hans morgenthau departed germany complete habilitation dissertation geneva hans kelsen advised resulted first book written french being published entitled reality norms particular norms international law foundations theory norms
remarkable good fortune morgenthau kelsen just arrived geneva professor became adviser morgenthau's dissertation
kelsen among strongest critics carl schmitt because schmitt advocating priority political concerns state over adherence state rule law
kelsen morgenthau united against national socialist school political interpretation down-played rule law became lifelong colleagues even after both emigrated europe take their respective academic positions united states
during these years kelsen morgenthau both become persona non grata germany during full rise power national socialism
kelsen principal defender morgenthau's habilitationschrift recently documented translation morgenthau's book titled concept political
introductory essay volume behr rosch indicate geneva faculty under examiners walther burckhardt paul guggenheim initially quite negative concerning morgenthau's habilitationschrift
morgenthau found paris publisher volume asked kelsen re-evaluate
words behr rosch kelsen right choice assess morgenthau's thesis because senior scholar staatslehre morgenthau's thesis also largely critical examination kelsen's legal positivism
thus kelsen whom morgenthau 'owed habilitation geneva' kelsen's biographer rudolf aladár métall confirms also eventually subsequent academic career because kelsen produced positive evaluation convinced board examiners award morgenthau habilitation
1934 age 52 published first edition reine rechtslehre pure theory law
while geneva became deeply interested international law
interest international law kelsen reaction largely kellogg–briand pact 1929 negative reaction vast idealism saw represented pages along lack recognition sanctions illicit actions belligerent states
kelsen come endorse strongly sanction-delict theory law saw substantially under-represented kellogg–briand pact

kelsen defending position distinction philosophical definition justice separable application positive law
fuller stated opposition share opinion jerome hall evidenced excellent readings jurisprudence should start justice
place preference exhortatory grounds belief until wrestled problem justice cannot truly understand other issues jurisprudence
kelsen example excludes justice studies practical law because 'irrational ideal' therefore 'not subject cognition
whole structure theory derives exclusion

originally published german language 1953
pure theory law kelsen considered preeminent jurists 20 th century highly influential among scholars jurisprudence public law especially europe latin america although less common-law countries
book titled pure theory law published two editions europe 1934 second expanded edition after joined faculty university california berkeley 1960
kelsen's pure theory law german reine rechtslehre widely acknowledged magnum opus
aims describe law hierarchy norms also binding norms while same time refusing itself evaluate those norms
'legal science' separated 'legal politics'
central pure theory law notion 'basic norm grundnorm'—a hypothetical norm presupposed theory hierarchy 'lower' norms legal system beginning constitutional law understood derive their authority 'bindingness'
way kelsen contends bindingness legal norms their specifically 'legal' character understood without tracing ultimately suprahuman source such god personified nature personified state nation
pure theory law generally considered among most original contributions made hans kelsen legal theory
book title first published 1934 greatly expanded second edition effectively magnum opus doubled length presentation 1960
second edition appeared english translation 1967 pure theory law first edition appeared english translation 1992 introduction problems legal theory
theory proposed book probably most influential theory law produced during 20 th century
least high points modernist legal theory
however original terminology introduced first edition already present many kelsen's writings 1920 s also subject discussion critical press decade
although second edition much longer two editions great deal similar content
summary below will follow outline second edition unless stated otherwise
pure theory law theory positive law first paragraph pure theory law kelsen introduces theory being theory positive law
theory positive law then presented kelsen forming hierarchy laws start basic norm grundnorm other norms related each other either being inferior norms compared other superior norms
interaction these norms then further subject representation static theory law kelsen's chapter 4 dynamic theory law kelsen's chapter 5
law morality pure theory law kelsen's strict separation law morality chapter two pure theory law integral part presentation pure theory law
application law order protected moral influence political influence needed safeguarded separation sphere conventional moral influence political influence
kelsen deny moral discussion still possible even encouraged sociological domain intersubjective activity
however pure theory law subject such influences
law science chapter three pure theory law law defined application norms functions within delineations science law
science generally domain causal understanding epistemological data primary logical causally oriented technique distinguished normative reasoning found pure theory law
therefore legal sciences normatively based distinction physical sciences causally based
static aspect law chapter four kelsen distinguishes static theory law dynamic theory law
static theory law represents law hierarchy laws individual laws related being either superior inferior other
hierarchical theory largely adopted adolf merkl's research structural aspects law while kelsen still vienna
nearly hundred pages each kelsen's chapters static aspect law dynamic aspect law most extensively developed sections book
dynamic aspect law chapter five pure theory law sections 34 35 kelsen discusses dynamic theory law
dynamic theory law static theory law comes direct contact governmental administration state must recognize function legislature writing new law
same time there also understanding law being affected accumulated standing law represents decisions courts principle become part hierarchical representation pure theory law
importantly kelsen allows legislative process recognize law product political ethical debate product activity legislature before becomes part domain static theory law
nearly hundred pages length chapter dynamic aspect law longest most fully developed chapter book other chapter static aspect law
law state chapter six pure theory law kelsen present celebrated identity theory law state
kelsen's highly functional theory state law representing same entity
confused sociological domain cultural domain intersubjective activity
nor confused political even religious domain intersubjective interaction among individuals
state law international law chapter seven kelsen discusses interaction state law international law these especially guided understanding political sovereignty
kelsen assessment international law represents very primitive form law distinct contrast highly developed forms law may found individual nations states
result kelsen emphasizes international law often prone conduct war severe diplomatic measures blockade seizure internment etc
offering corrective measures available regulating conduct nations
kelsen largely inevitable due relative primitiveness international law contemporary society
interpretation kelsen's final chapter chapter eight deals subject interpretation least three most important aspects
first kelsen discusses nature methodology interpretation law

four major areas kelsen's contributions legal theory over lifetime included following areas judicial review ii hierarchical law iii de-ideologicalization positive law strongly disassociate reference natural law iv clear delineation science law legal science twentieth century modern law
judicial review judicial review kelsen twentieth century part tradition inherited common law tradition based upon american constitutional experience introduced john marshall

drafting constitutions both austria czechoslovakia kelsen chose carefully delineate limit domain judicial review narrower focus originally accommodated john marshall
kelsen receive lifetime appointment court judicial review austria remain court almost entire decade during 1920 s
hierarchical law hierarchical law model understanding structural description process understanding applying law central kelsen adopted model directly colleague adolf merkl university vienna
main purposes hierarchical description law three-fold kelsen
first essential understanding celebrated static theory law elaborated chapter four book pure theory law see subsection above
second edition chapter static theory law almost hundred pages length represented comprehensive study law capable standing independent subject research legal scholars area specialization
second measure relative centralization decentralization
third fully centralized system law also correspond unique grundnorm basic norm inferior any other norm hierarchy due placement utmost foundation hierarchy see grundnorm section below
de-ideologicalization positive law kelsen during time period education legal training fin-de-siecle europe inherited highly ambiguous definition natural law presented having metaphysical theological philosophical political religious ideological components depending any numerous sources might desire utilize term
kelsen ambiguity definition natural made unusable any practical sense modern approach understanding science law
kelsen explicitly defined positive law deal many ambiguities associated use natural law time along negative influence upon reception meant even positive law contexts apparently removed domain influence normally associated natural law
science law redefinition science law legal science meet requirements modern law twentieth century significant concern kelsen
kelsen write book-length studies detailing many distinctions made natural sciences their associated methodology causal reasoning contrast methodology normative reasoning saw directly suited legal sciences
science law legal science key methodological distinctions high importance kelsen development pure theory law general project removing ambiguous ideological elements having undue influence development modern twentieth century law
last years kelsen turned comprehensive presentation ideas norms
unfinished manuscript published posthumously allgemeine theorie normen general theory norms
political philosophy during last 29 years life university california kelsen's appointment university affiliation primarily department politics school law
strongly reflected many writings field political philosophy both before after joining faculty berkeley
fact kelsen's very first book see section above written political philosophy dante alighieri second book kelsen started write book length studies philosophy law practical applications
baume speaks kelsen's political philosophy concerning judicial review coming closest ronald dworkin john hart ely among scholars active after end kelsen's life
order gain useful understanding breadth kelsen's interests political philosophy informative examine charles covell's book titled redefinition conservatism 1980 s covell engages kelsen philosophical context ludwig wittgenstein roger scruton michael oakeshott john casey maurice cowling
although kelsen's own political preferences generally aimed towards liberal forms expression covell's perspective modern liberal conservatism book provides effective foil bringing light kelsen's own points emphasis within own orientations political philosophy
covell summarizes them kelsen's interests political philosophy ranged across fields practical perspectives underlying morality religion culture social custom
summarized sandrine baume her recent book kelsen 1927 [kelsen] recognized debt kantianism methodological point determined much pure theory law 'purity method indispensable legal science seem me guaranteed any philosopher sharply kant contrast ought
thus me kantian philosophy very outset light guided me
kelsen's high praise kant absence any specific neo-kantians matched among recent scholars john rawls harvard university
both kelsen rawls also made strong endorsements kant's books perpetual peace 1795 idea universal history 1784
book titled justice? kelsen indicated position concerning social justice stating [s]uppose possible prove economic situation people improved essentially so-called planned economy social security guaranteed everybody equal measure such organization possible individual freedom abolished
answer question whether planned economy preferable free economy depends our decision values individual freedom social security
hence question whether individual freedom higher value social security vice versa subjective answer possible five principle areas concern kelsen area political philosophy identified among many interests their centrality effect exerted over virtually entire lifetime
these sovereignty ii law-state identity theory iii state-society dualism iv centralization-decentralization v dynamic theory law
sovereignty definition redefinition sovereignty kelsen context twentieth century modern law became central theme political philosophy hans kelsen 1920 end life
sovereignty state defines domain jurisdiction laws govern state associated society
principles explicitly defined sovereignty become increasing importance kelsen domain concerns extended comprehensively international law manifold implications following conclusion wwi
very regulation international law presence asserted sovereign borders present either major barrier kelsen application principles international law represent areas mitigation sovereignty greatly facilitate progress effectiveness international law geopolitics
law-state identity theory understanding kelsen's highly functional reading identity law state continues represent most challenging barriers students researchers law approaching kelsen's writings first time
after kelsen completed doctoral dissertation political philosophy dante turned study jellinek's dualist theory law state heidelberg years leading 1910
kelsen found although high respect jellinek leading scholar day jellinek endorsement dualist theory law state impediment further development legal science supportive development responsible law throughout twentieth century addressing requirements new century regulation society culture
kelsen's highly functional reading state most compatible manner locate allowing development positive law manner compatible demands twentieth century geopolitics
state-society distinctions delineations after accepting need endorsing explicit reading identity law state kelsen remained equally sensitive recognizing need society nonetheless express tolerance even encourage discussion debate philosophy sociology theology metaphysics sociology politics religion
culture society regulated state according legislative constitutional norms
kelsen recognized province society extensive sense allow discussion religion natural law metaphysics arts etc
development culture many varied attributes
very significantly kelsen come strong inclination writings discussion justice example appropriate domain society culture though dissemination within law highly narrow dubious
twentieth century version modern law kelsen need very carefully appropriately delineate responsible discussion philosophical justice science law allowed progress effective manner responding geopolitical domestic needs new century
centralization decentralization common theme unavoidable kelsen within many applications encountered political philosophy centralization decentralization
kelsen centralization philosophically key position understanding pure theory law
pure theory law many ways dependent upon logical regress hierarchy superior inferior norms reaching centralized point origination hierarchy termed basic norm grundnorm
kelsen's general assessments centralization often associated modern highly developed forms enhancements improvements sociological cultural norms while presence decentralization measure primitive less sophisticated observations concerning sociological cultural norms
dynamic theory law dynamic theory law singled out subsection discussing political philosophy hans kelsen very same reasons kelsen applied separating explication discussion static theory law within pages book pure theory law
dynamic theory law explicit very acutely defined mechanism state process legislation allows new law created already established laws revised result political debate sociological cultural domains activity
kelsen devotes longest chapters revised version book pure theory law discussing central importance associated dynamic theory law
length nearly hundred pages suggestive central significance book whole may almost studied independent book own right complementing other themes kelsen covers book
reception criticism section delineates reception criticism kelsen's writings research throughout lifetime
also explicates reaction scholarly reception after death 1973 concerning intellectual legacy
throughout lifetime kelsen maintained highly authoritative position representing wide range contributions theory practice law
few scholars study law able match ability engage often polarize legal opinion during own lifetime extending well legacy reception after death
significant example involves introduction development term grundnorm briefly summarized illustrate diverse responses opinion able often stimulate legal community time
short version reception illustrative many similar debates kelsen involved many points career may summarized follows
kelsen's defense nuremberg war crime trials received explicit criticism joseph raz recent years
grundnorm regarding kelsen's original use term grundnorm closest antecedent appears writings colleague adolf merkl university vienna
merkl developing structural research approach understanding law matter hierarchical relationship norms largely basis their being either superior other inferior respect each other
kelsen adapted assimilated much merkl's approach own presentation pure theory law both original version 1934 revised version 1960
kelsen importance grundnorm large measure two-fold since importantly indicated logical regress superior relationships norms led norm ultimately no other norm inferior
second feature represented importance kelsen associated concept fully centralized legal order contrast existence decentralized forms government representing legal orders
another form reception term originated fairly extended attempt read kelsen neo-kantian following early exchange hermann cohen 1913 concerning publication habilitation dissertation 1911 public law
cohen leading neo-kantian time kelsen own way receptive many ideas cohen expressed published book review kelsen's writing
kelsen insisted never used material actual writing own book though cohen's ideas attractive their own right
resulted longest-running debates within general kelsen community whether kelsen became neo-kantian himself after encounter cohen managed keep own non-neo-kantian position intact claimed prevailing circumstance first book 1911
neo-kantians pressing issue lead kelsen discussions concerning whether existence such grundnorm basic norm strictly symbolic whether concrete foundation
led further division within debate concerning currency term grundnorm whether should read hand part parcel hans vaihinger's as-if hypothetical construction
other hand those seeking practical reading grundnorm corresponded something directly concretely comparable sovereign nation's federal constitution under organized regional local laws no law recognized being superior
different contexts kelsen indicate preferences different ways neo-kantians asserting late life kelsen largely abide symbolic reading term used neo-kantian context documented
neo-kantian reading kelsen further subdivided three subgroups each representing their own preferred reading meaning grundnorm identifiable marburg neo-kantians baden-baden neo-kantians c own kelsenian reading neo-kantian school writings subject often associated found response cohen exchange circa 1911-1914
reception during kelsen's european years section covers kelsen's years austria germany czechoslovakia switzerland
while still austria kelsen entered debate versions public law prevailing time engaging predominating opinions jellinek gerber 1911 habilitation dissertation see description above
kelsen after attending jellinek's lectures heidelberg oriented interpretation according need extend jellinek's research past points jellinek set limits
kelsen effective operation legal order required separated political influences terms exceeded substantially terms jellinek adopted preferred form
response 1911 dissertation kelsen challenged neo-kantians originally led hermann cohen maintained there substantial neo-kantian insights open kelsen kelsen himself appear develop full extent their potential interpretation summarized section above
sara lagi her recent book kelsen 1920 s writings democracy articulated revised guarded reception jellinek kelsen
kelsen principal author passages incorporation judicial review constitutions austria czechoslovakia during 1910 s largely model john marshall american constitutional experience
georg jellinek agreed kelsen minority rights never read kelsen's theory identity law state
addition debate kelsen initiated separate discussion carl schmitt questions relating definition sovereignty interpretation international law
kelsen became deeply committed principle adherence state rule law above political controversy while schmitt adhered divergent view state deferring political fiat
debate effect polarizing opinion throughout 1920 s 1930 s leading up wwii also extended decades after kelsen's death 1973
third example controversies kelsen involved during european years surrounded severe disenchantment many felt concerning political legal outcomes wwi treaty versailles
kelsen believed blamelessness associated germany's political leaders military leaders indicated gross historical inadequacy international law no longer ignored
kelsen devoted much writings 1930 s leading 1940 s towards reversing historical inadequacy deeply debated until ultimately kelsen succeeded contributing international precedent establishing war crime trials political leaders military leaders end wwii nuremberg tokyo
critical reception during american years section covers kelsen's years during american years
kelsen's participation part establishment war crimes tribunals following wwii discussed previous section

two critics kelsen united states legal realist karl llewellyn jurist harold laski
llewellyn firm anti-positivist against kelsen stated see kelsen's work utterly sterile save by-products derive taking shrewd eyes moment off thinks 'pure law
democracy essay 1955 kelsen took up defense representative democracy made joseph schumpeter schumpeter's book democracy capitalism
although schumpeter took position unexpectedly favorable socialism kelsen felt rehabilitation reading schumpeter's book amicable democracy defended quoted schumpter's strong conviction realize relative validity one's convictions yet stand them unflinchingly consistent own defense democracy
kelsen himself made mixed statements concerning extensiveness greater lesser strict association democracy capitalism
hart represented anglo-american form legal positivism distinct kelsen's continental theory positive law
critical reception kelsen's legacy after 1973 many controversies critical debates during lifetime continued after kelsen's death 1973
kelsen's ability polarize opinion among established legal scholars continued influence reception writings well after death
formation european union recall many debates schmitt issue degree centralization principle possible implications concerning state sovereignty once unification put place
