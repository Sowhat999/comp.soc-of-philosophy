early work convention lewis's first monograph convention philosophical study 1969 based doctoral dissertation uses concepts game theory analyze nature social conventions won american philosophical association's first franklin matchette prize best book published philosophy philosopher under 40 years old
lewis claimed social conventions such convention most states drives right left convention original caller will re-call phone conversation interrupted etc
solutions so-called 'co-ordination problems'
co-ordination problems time lewis's book under-discussed kind game-theoretical problem most game-theoretical discussion circulated around problems participants conflict such prisoner's dilemma
co-ordination problems problematic though participants common interests there several solutions
sometimes solutions may 'salient' concept invented game-theorist economist thomas schelling whom lewis much inspired
example co-ordination problem form meeting may salient solution there possible spot meet town
most cases must rely lewis calls precedent order get salient solution
both participants know particular co-ordination problem say side should drive on? solved same way numerous times before both know both know both know both know both know etc
particular state lewis calls common knowledge since much discussed philosophers game theorists then will easily solve problem
solved problem successfully will seen even people thus convention will spread society
convention thus behavioural regularity sustains itself because serves interests everyone involved
another important feature convention convention entirely different just well drive left less arbitrary drives right usa example
lewis's main goal book however wasn't simply provide account convention rather investigate platitude language ruled convention convention p
last two chapters book signalling systems conventions language cf
also languages language 1975 make case use language population consists conventions truthfulness trust among members population
lewis recasts framework notions those truth analyticity claiming better understood relations sentences language rather properties sentences
counterfactuals modal realism lewis went publish counterfactuals 1973 contained analysis counterfactual conditionals terms theory possible worlds
already proposed earlier papers - counterpart theory quantified modal logic 1968 anselm actuality 1970 counterparts persons their bodies 1971
spite significant technical advantages promised approach theory widely considered too implausible taken literally lewis urged should
most often idea there exists infinite number causally isolated universes each real our own different way furthermore alluding objects universe necessary order explain makes certain counterfactual statements true others meets lewis calls incredulous stare lewis opw 2005 pg
lewis defends elaborates theory extreme modal realism while insisting there nothing extreme plurality worlds 1986
lewis acknowledges theory contrary common sense believes advantages far outweigh disadvantage therefore should hesitant pay price
according lewis makes counterfactual conditional form made shot our team won game
true there world concrete ours significantly similar my counterpart makes rather misses shot counterpart our team wins game
there world even similar ours my counterpart makes shot counterpart our team still loses counterfactual false
speak counterfactual possibilities speak case possible world worlds
according lewis actual merely indexical label give world locate ourselves
things necessarily true true possible worlds
note lewis first speak possible worlds context
leibniz c
lewis example both speak possible worlds way thinking possibility necessity david kaplan's early work counterpart theory
lewis's original suggestion possible worlds equally concrete world find ourselves no real any other possible world
criticisms theory faced number criticisms
particular clear how know goes other worlds
after causally disconnected ours can't look them see going there
related objection while people concerned done concerned people other worlds no matter how similar them
saul kripke once put presidential candidate care less whether someone else another world wins election does care whether himself won kripke 1980 p
basic criticism introducing many entities our ontology violates maxim occam's razor tells us multiply theoretical entities beyond necessary explain facts our theories aim explain
possible worlds employed work saul kripke many others concrete sense propounded lewis
while none these alternative approaches found anything near universal acceptance very few philosophers accept lewis's particular brand modal realism
