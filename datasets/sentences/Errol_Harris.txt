critique empiricism epistemological methodological criticisms empiricism harris holds epistemological position philosophical empiricism insuperably inconsistent every version found european thought locke twentieth-century analytic philosophers
verification principle upon empiricism grounded held harris intrinsically false because sense perception devoid immediate self-evidence depending interpretative context product thinking's discursive activity
furthermore verification principle also unable account empiricist epistemologist's claim truth own doctrine
empiricism's fallacy propounding theory knowledge true theorist himself must exempt applies theorist himself must false
[citation needed] nor empiricism able successfully overcome logical antinomies infecting inductive method usually tries explain justify genesis validity universal form scientific theories
finally harris argued hypothetico-deductive method empiricists such sir karl popper employ order overcome shortcomings inductive method epistemologically unfruitful owing merely analytic conjectural nature
theoretical metaphysical criticisms empiricism harris does limit himself refuting empiricism purely logico-immanent way also argues careful examination theoretical results achieved contemporary physics biology experimental psychology well procedures scientific enquiry reveals empiricism even harmony specific orientation contemporary science
concludes science supports world-view relativistic holistic organicistic teleological hierarchical character—a world-view contradicted unconfessed atomistic mechanical pluralistic metaphysical presuppositions formal mathematical logic wrongly privileged philosophical empiricism
philosophical historiography harris maintains temporal variation different metaphysical doctrines cannot regarded procession discontinuous subjective opinions whose validity best confined particular epochs
contrary asserts existence eternal problems philosophy conceives their historical development unique logically necessary teleological process through progressively achieve coherent adequate formulations
philosophical historiography therefore should simply confine itself registering external philological characteristics doctrines under consideration without making value judgements them
peculiar task rather discerning them true false
historiographical studies harris gives considerable attention spinoza's hegel's metaphysics
substance attributes spinoza stressing crucial relevance spinoza's doctrines infinity attribute cogitatio idea ideae intellectus infinitus dei infinite mind god infinite mode substance harris disputed saw one-sided empiricist materialistic interpretations spinoza's naturalism
argues spinoza's polemic against final causes ought understood referring standpoint external teleology consequently spinoza does exclude valid explanation natural processes light inner teleology
other hand harris also rejects opposite mystical acosmistic interpretations relationship substance attributes according substance undifferentiated attributes nothing contingent product human intellect
harris contrary maintains spinoza's theory scientia intuitiva clearly shows spinoza consistently conceives substance's self-identity intrinsically differentiated rational system individual essences moreover spinoza's geometric method simply outward dress inferential procedure similar dialectical method
hegel's naturphilosophie harris's interpretation hegel's philosophy—unlike most hegelian interpreters nineteenth twentieth centuries—emphasizes crucial role naturphilosophie hegel's metaphysics
wake many philosophical developments affected theoretical underpinnings natural sciences late nineteenth early twentieth centuries harris outlines reform hegel's naturphilosophie rejects obsolete least three main contentions natural sciences nothing product finite intellect's analytic activity 2 impossible cogently prove coming-to-be natural philosophy unitary process real biological evolution 3 bad infinity spaciotemporal form inorganic nature clear evidence self-contradictoriness
[citation needed] according harris fact einstein's theories special general relativity well contemporary cosmological theories expanding universe involve plausible conception physical universe finite unbounded whole safely regarded objective natural embodiment infinitum actu true infinity hegel instead confined subjectivity life spirit
harris's epistemology metaphysics philosophy mind harris advocates possibility knowledge objective truth criticism naïve realism positivistic epistemology never takes form subjectivism skepticism
truth apex teleological process whose abstract elementary forms theoretical perspectives worked out natural human sciences while most concrete fully blown aspect coincides self-reflective activity metaphysical thought
elements metaphysics show acknowledged influences spinoza's rationalistic monism hegel's absolute idealism collingwood's logic joachim's coherence theory truth
philosophical theory demanded modern outlook must accordingly maintain five main theses mind immanent things ii reality whole self-sufficient self-maintaining coherence test truth any theory iii subject object knowledge ultimately same thing viewed opposite mutually complementary standpoints iv events phenomena adequately explained teleologically v ultimate principle interpretation consequence principle value
harris's view ultimate unity subject object knowledge means reality peculiar object metaphysical thought identical logical reason self-conscious act systematic thought thinks reality
harris dialectical logic grasp essence such identity
sublating absolute idea very negativity finitude appearance error dialectical logic disclose logical universe simply aggregate bloodless categoriesbut rather fully actual self-sufficient self-conscious whole
