according zerzan original human societies paleolithic times similar societies today such !kung mbuti live non-alienated non-oppressive form life based primitive abundance closeness nature
constructing such societies kind political ideal least instructive comparison against denounce contemporary especially industrial societies zerzan uses anthropological studies such societies basis wide-ranging critique aspects modern life
portrays contemporary society world misery built psychological production sense scarcity lack
history civilization history renunciation stands against progress rather utopia arises negation
zerzan anarchist broadly associated philosophies anarcho-primitivism green anarchism anti-civilisation post-left anarchy neo-luddism particular critique technology
rejects state forms hierarchical authoritarian relations
most simply anarchy means 'without rule
implies rejection government other forms domination power well
zerzan's work relies heavily strong dualism primitive viewed non-alienated wild non-hierarchical ludic socially egalitarian civilised viewed alienated domesticated hierarchically organised socially discriminatory
hence life before domestication/agriculture fact largely leisure intimacy nature sensual wisdom sexual equality health
zerzan's claims status primitive societies based certain reading works anthropologists such marshall sahlins richard
crucially category primitives restricted pure hunter-gatherer societies no domesticated plants animals
instance hierarchy among northwest coast native americans whose main activities fishing foraging attributed their having domesticated dogs tobacco
zerzan calls future primitive radical reconstruction society based rejection alienation embracing wild
may our real hope recovery face-to-face social existence radical decentralization dismantling devouring estranging productionist high-tech trajectory impoverishing
usual use anthropological evidence comparative demonstrative necessity naturality aspects modern western societies challenged pointing counter-examples hunter-gatherer societies
ever-growing documentation human prehistory very long period largely non-alienated life stands sharp contrast increasingly stark failures untenable modernity
unclear however whether implies re-establishment literal forms hunter-gatherer societies broader kind learning their ways life order construct non-alienated relations
zerzan's political project calls destruction technology
draws same distinction ivan illich tools stay under control user technological systems draw user their control
difference division labour zerzan opposes
zerzan's philosophy technology possessed elite automatically power over other users power sources alienation along domestication symbolic thought
zerzan's typical method take particular construct civilisation technology belief practice institution construct account historical origins calls destructive alienating effects contrasts hunter-gatherer experiences
essay number example zerzan starts contrasting civilized emphasis counting measuring primitive emphasis sharing citing dorothy lee's work trobriand islanders support before constructing narrative rise number through cumulative stages state domination starting desire egyptian kings measure ruled
approach repeated relation time gender inequality work technology art ritual agriculture globalization

zerzan unabomber mid-1990 s zerzan became confidant theodore kaczynski unabomber after read industrial society future so-called unabomber manifesto
zerzan sat through unabomber trial often conversed kaczynski during proceedings
after zerzan became known friend unabomber mainstream media became interested zerzan ideas
may 7 1995 full-page interview zerzan featured new york times
zerzan's essay whose unabomber? 1995 signaled support kaczynski doctrine criticised bombings [t]he mailing explosive devices intended agents engineering present catastrophe too random
children mail carriers others easily killed
even granted legitimacy striking high-tech horror show terrorizing indispensable architects collateral harm justifiable
however zerzan same essay offered qualified defense unabomber's actions concept justice should overlooked considering unabomber phenomenon
fact except targets many little eichmanns preparing brave new world ever called account?
unethical try stop those whose contributions bringing unprecedented assault life? two years later 1997 essay means — you? zerzan enter unabomber new line being drawn
time bohemian schiz-fluxers green yuppies hobbyist anarcho-journalists condescending organizers poor hip nihilo-aesthetes other anarchists thought their pretentious pastimes go unchallenged indefinitely — well it's time pick side you're

[citation needed] criticism history catastrophe anarchism essay social anarchism lifestyle anarchism unbridgeable chasm murray bookchin directed criticism anarchist point view zerzan's anti-civilizational anti-technological perspective
argued zerzan's representation hunter-gatherers flawed selective often patronisingly racist analysis superficial practical proposals nonsensical

essay listen anarchist! chaz bufe criticized primitivist position anarchist perspective pointing out primitivists extremely vague exactly technologies advocate keeping seek abolish noting smallpox eradicated thanks medical technology
theodore j
kaczynski better known unabomber surprisingly harsh critic current anarcho-primitivist mainstream zerzan particular sees foolish invalid projection leftist values such gender equality pacifism leisure time onto primitive way life
kaczynski holds values gender equality pacifism leisure time etc
while still admirable exactly values techno-industrial civilization promised techno-utopia
second holds having such interpretation counter-productive ultimate anti-civilization/anti-tech goal attracts leftist types nature uncommitted act dilute movement
kaczynski insists core values freedom autonomy dignity human fulfillment must emphasized above others
zerzan's views criticized being anti-anarchist
solution - return hunter-gatherer lifestyle - criticized likely lead loss life
critics largely reject claim anarchist
