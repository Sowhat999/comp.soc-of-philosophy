ideas ricardo became interested economics after reading adam smith's wealth nations 1799
first economics article age 37
ricardo's idea became accepted england become orthodox economic ideas modern western world government seen having determining role economic development
also abolitionist speaking meeting court east india company march 1823 regarded slavery stain character nation
sister hanna married david samuda 1776-1824 came slave-owning family substantial number slaves jamaica
comparative advantage 1500 1750 most economists advocated mercantilism promoted idea international trade purpose gaining bullion running trade surplus other countries
ricardo challenged idea purpose trade merely accumulate gold silver
comparative advantage ricardo argued favour industry specialisation free trade
attempted prove using simple mathematics industry specialization combined free international trade produces positive results
theory expanded concept absolute advantage
ricardo argued there mutual national benefit trade even country competitive every area trading counterpart nation should concentrate resources industries comparative advantage those industries greatest competitive edge
ricardo suggested national industries fact profitable internationally competitive should jettisoned favour most competitive industries
ricardo's theory comparative advantage assumes existence industry trade policy national level
does presume business decisions should made independently entrepreneurs basis viability profit
ricardo attempted prove using simple numerical example international trade beneficial
paul samuelson called numbers used ricardo's numerical example dealing trade england portugal four magic numbers
spite fact portuguese produce both cloth wine less amount labor ricardo suggested theoretically both countries benefit trade each other
joan robinson subsequently pointed out reality following opening free trade england portugal endured centuries economic underdevelopment imposition free trade portugal killed off promising textile industry left her slow-growing export market wine while england exports cotton cloth led accumulation mechanisation whole spiralling growth industrial revolution
robinson argued ricardo's example required economies static equilibrium positions full employment there trade deficit trade surplus
these conditions she relevant real world
she also argued ricardo's theory take account countries may different levels development raised prospect 'unequal exchange' might hamper country's development saw case portugal
protectionism like adam smith ricardo opponent protectionism national economies especially agriculture
believed british corn laws—tariffs agricultural products—ensured less-productive domestic land harvested rents driven up case & fair 1999 pp
812 813
thus profits directed toward landlords away emerging industrial capitalists
since ricardo believed landlords tended squander their wealth luxuries rather invest believed corn laws leading stagnation british economy
1846 nephew john lewis ricardo mp stoke-on-trent advocated free trade repeal corn laws
modern empirical analysis corn laws yield mixed results
parliament repealed corn laws 1846
value theory ricardo's most famous work principles political economy taxation 1817
ricardo opens first chapter statement labor theory value
labour theory value required several assumptions both sectors same wage rate same profit rate capital employed production made up wages period production same length both goods
ricardo himself realized second third assumptions quite unrealistic hence admitted two exceptions labour theory value production periods may differ two production processes may employ instruments equipment capital just wages very different proportions
ricardo continued work value theory end life
rent main article law rent ricardo responsible developing theories rent wages profits
defined rent difference produce obtained employment two equal quantities capital labor
ricardo believed process economic development increased land utilization eventually led cultivation poorer land principally benefited landowners
according ricardo such premium over real social value reaped due ownership constitutes value individual best paper monetary return society
portion such purely individual benefit exclusively portion accrues scarce resources such land gold over above any socially beneficial exchange ricardo labels rent
ricardo concluded tax land value equivalent tax land rent minus improvements form taxation lead price increases
land itself no cost production because produced humans
thus price determined cost best available rent-free alternative tax burdens person claiming exclusive use
malthus's criticism extrapolation problem ricardian rent attempting demonstrate ricardian rent constitutes value nothing ricardo neglecting say's law savings by-definition-equals investment
malthus suggested rent however misplaced constitutes prime source savings investment future
[original research?] ricardo's theories wages profits several authorities consider ricardo source concepts behind so-called iron law wages according wages naturally tend subsistence level
others dispute assignment ricardo idea
theory profit ricardo stated real wages increase real profits decrease because revenue sale manufactured goods split profits wages
essay profits profits depend high low wages wages price necessaries price necessaries chiefly price food
criticism ricardian theory trade ricardo's argument favour free trade attacked those believe trade restriction necessary economic development nation
utsa patnaik claims ricardian theory international trade contains logical fallacy
ricardo assumed both countries two goods producible actually produced developed underdeveloped countries often trade those goods producible their own country
example many northern countries produce tropical fruits
these cases cannot define country comparative advantage
critics also argue ricardo's theory comparative advantage flawed assumes production continuous absolute
real world events outside realm human control e
natural disasters disrupt production
case specialisation cripple country depends imports foreign naturally disrupted countries
example industrially based country trades manufactured goods agrarian country exchange agricultural products natural disaster agricultural country e
drought may cause industrially based country starve
development economist ha-joon chang challenges argument free trade benefits every country ricardo’s theory absolutely right—within narrow confines
theory correctly says accepting their current levels technology given better countries specialize things relatively better
cannot argue
theory fails country wants acquire advanced technologies—that wants develop economy
takes time experience absorb new technologies technologically backward producers need period protection international competition during period learning
such protection costly because country giving up chance import better cheaper products
however price paid wants develop advanced industries
ricardo’s theory thus seen those accept status quo those want change
ricardian equivalence another idea associated ricardo ricardian equivalence argument suggesting circumstances government's choice how pay spending
whether use tax revenue issue debt run deficit might no effect economy
ricardo notes proposition theoretically implied presence intertemporal optimisation rational tax-payers since tax-payers act rationally proposition fails true practice
thus while proposition bears name does seem believed
economist robert barro responsible modern prominence
influence intellectual legacy david ricardo's ideas tremendous influence later developments economics
us economists rank ricardo second most influential economic thinker behind adam smith prior twentieth century
ricardo became theoretical father classical political economy
however schumpeter coined expression ricardian vice indicates rigorous logic does provide good economic theory
criticism applies also most neoclassical theories make heavy use mathematics according theoretically unsound because conclusion being drawn does logically follow theories used defend
[citation needed] ricardian socialists ricardo's writings fascinated number early socialists 1820 s thought value theory radical implications
argued view labor theory value labor produces entire product profits capitalists get result exploitations workers
these include thomas hodgskin william thompson john francis bray percy ravenstone
georgists georgists believe rent sense ricardo used belongs community whole
henry george greatly influenced ricardo often cited including most famous work progress poverty 1879

neo-ricardians after rise 'neoclassical' school ricardo's influence declined temporarily
piero sraffa editor collected works david ricardo author seminal production commodities means commodities resurrected ricardo originator another strand economics thought effaced arrival neoclassical school
new interpretation ricardo sraffa's criticism against marginal theory value gave rise new school now named neo-ricardian sraffian school
major contributors school includes luigi pasinetti 1930– pierangelo garegnani 1930–2011 ian steedman 1941– geoffrey harcourt 1931– heinz kurz 1946– neri salvadori 1951– pier paolo saviotti among others

neo-ricardian school sometimes seen component post-keynesian economics
neo-ricardian trade theory inspired piero sraffa new strand trade theory emerged named neo-ricardian trade theory
main contributors include ian steedman stanley metcalfe
criticised neoclassical international trade theory namely heckscher–ohlin model basis notion capital primary factor no method measuring before determination profit rate thus trapped logical vicious circle
second round cambridge capital controversy time field international trade
evolutionary growth theory several distinctive groups sprung out neo-ricardian school
evolutionary growth theory developed notably luigi pasinetti j
metcalfe pier paolo saviotti koen frenken others
pasinetti argued demand any commodity came stagnate frequently decline demand saturation occurs
introduction new commodities goods services necessary avoid economic stagnation
contemporary theories ricardo's idea even expanded case continuum goods dornbusch fischer samuelson formulation employed example matsuyama others
ricardian trade theory ordinarily assumes labour unique input
deficiency intermediate goods great part international trade
situation changed greatly after appearance yoshinori shiozawa's seminal work 2007
yeats found 30% world trade manufacturing intermediate inputs
bardhan jafee found intermediate inputs occupy 37 38% imports us years 1992 1997 whereas percentage intrafirm trade grew 43% 1992 52% 1997
unequal exchange chris edward includes emmanuel's unequal exchange theory among variations neo-ricardian trade theory
arghiri emmanuel argued third world poor because international exploitation[clarification needed] labour
[verification needed] unequal exchange theory trade influential new dependency theory
publications works 1852 ricardo's publications included high price bullion proof depreciation bank notes 1810 advocated adoption metallic currency
essay influence low price corn profits stock 1815 argued repealing corn laws distribute wealth productive members society
principles political economy taxation 1817 analysis concluded land rent grows population increases
