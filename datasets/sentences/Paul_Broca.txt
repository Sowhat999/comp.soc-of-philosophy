major concerns comparative anatomy brain
neuroanatomist made important contributions understanding limbic system rhinencephalon
olfaction sign animality
extensively biological evolution then known transformism france term also adopted english time today used little either language
later career broca public health public education
engaged discussion health care poor becoming important figure assistance publique
also advocated secular education women famously opposed félix-antoine-philibert dupanloup 1802–1878 roman catholic bishop orléans wanted keep control women's education
broca's major areas expertise comparative anatomy brain
research localization speech led entirely new research lateralization brain function
speech research paul broca broca celebrated discovery speech production center brain located ventroposterior region frontal lobes now known broca's area
arrived discovery studying brains aphasic patients persons speech language disorders resulting brain injuries
area study began broca dispute proponents cerebral localization whose views derived phrenology franz joseph gall 1758–1828 their opponents led pierre flourens 1794–1867 claimed careful ablation various brain regions disproved gall's hypotheses
however gall's former student jean-baptiste bouillaud 1796–1881 kept localization function hypothesis alive especially regards language center although rejected much rest phrenological thinking
bouillaud challenged professionals time disprove finding case frontal lobe damage unaccompanied disorder speech
son-in-law ernest aubertin 1825–1893 began seeking out cases either support disprove theory found several support
broca's society anthropology paris became new platform localization function controversy several experts head brain anatomy joined including aubertin
most these experts still supported flourens argument aubertin persistent presenting new patients counter their views
however broca aubertin finally put localization function existence issue rest
1861 broca heard patient named leborgne bicêtre hospital 21-year progressive loss speech paralysis loss comprehension nor mental function
nicknamed tan due inability clearly speak any words other tan
leborgne died just few days later broca performed autopsy
determined predicted leborgne fact lesion frontal lobe left cerebral hemisphere
comparative progression leborgne's loss speech motor movement area brain important speech production determined lie within third convolution left frontal lobe next lateral sulcus
next two years broca went find autopsy evidence 12 cases support localization articulated language
although history credits discovery broca another french neurologist marc dax made similar observations generation earlier died shortly after no chance further evidence
[citation needed] today brains many broca's aphasic patients still preserved musée dupuytren collection casts musée d'anatomie delmas-orfila-rouvière
broca presented study leborgne 1861 bulletin société anatomique
patients damage broca's area and/or neighboring regions left inferior frontal lobe often categorized clinically having expressive aphasia also known broca's aphasia
type aphasia often involves impairments speech output contrasted receptive aphasia also known wernicke's aphasia named karl wernicke characterized damage posterior regions left temporal lobe often characterized impairments language comprehension
anthropological research broca first became acquainted anthropology through works isidore geoffroy saint-hilaire 1805–1861 antoine étienne reynaud augustin serres 1786–1868 jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau 1810–1892 anthropology soon became lifetime interest
spent much time anthropological institute studying skulls bones
sense broca pioneer study physical anthropology
advanced science cranial anthropometry developing many new types measuring instruments craniometers numerical indices
broca also contributed field comparative anatomy primates humans
interested relationship anatomical features brain mental capabilities such intelligence
believed many time man's intellectual qualities measured size brain
research asserted men larger brains woman superior races larger brains inferior races
modern scientists such stephen jay gould criticised broca's research using priori expectations scientific racism
broca published around 223 papers general anthropology physical anthropology ethnology other branches field
founded société d'anthropologie de paris 1859 revue d'anthropologie 1872 school anthropology paris 1876
[citation needed] broca's legacy discovery broca's area revolutionized understanding language processing speech production comprehension well effects damage area may cause
broca played major role localization function debate resolving issue scientifically leborgne 12 cases thereafter
research led others discover location wide variety other functions specifically wernicke's area
[citation needed] new research found dysfunction area may lead other speech disorders such stuttering apraxia speech
recent anatomical neuroimaging studies shown pars opercularis broca's area anatomically smaller individuals stutter whereas pars triangularis appears normal
[citation needed] also invented 20 measuring instruments use craniology helped standardize measuring procedures
