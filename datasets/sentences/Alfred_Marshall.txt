main technical contribution masterful analysis issues elasticity consumer surplus increasing diminishing returns short long terms marginal utility many ideas original marshall others improved version ideas w
jevons others
broader sense marshall hoped reconcile classical modern theories value
john stuart mill examined relationship value commodities their production costs theory value depends effort expended manufacture
jevons marginal utility theorists elaborated theory value based idea maximising utility holding value depends demand
marshall's work used both these approaches focused costs
noted short run supply cannot changed market value depends mainly demand
intermediate time period production expanded existing facilities such buildings machinery since these require renewal within intermediate period their costs called fixed overhead supplementary costs little influence sale price product
marshall pointed out prime variable costs constantly recur influence sale price most period
still longer period machines buildings wear out replaced sale price product must high enough cover such replacement costs
classification costs fixed variable emphasis given element time probably represent marshall's chief contributions economic theory
committed partial equilibrium models over general equilibrium grounds inherently dynamical nature economics made former practically useful
alfred marshall's supply demand graph
much success marshall's teaching principles book derived effective use diagrams soon emulated other teachers worldwide
alfred marshall first develop standard supply demand graph demonstrating number fundamentals regarding supply demand including supply demand curves market equilibrium relationship quantity price regards supply demand law marginal utility law diminishing returns ideas consumer producer surpluses
model now used economists various forms using different variables demonstrate several other economic principles
marshall's model allowed visual representation complex economic fundamentals before ideas theories capable being explained through words
these models now critical throughout study economics because allow clear concise representation fundamentals theories being explained
theoretical contributions marshall considered most influential economists time largely shaping mainstream economic thought next fifty years being founders school neoclassical economics
although economics advertised extensions refinements work adam smith david ricardo thomas robert malthus john stuart mill extended economics away classical focus market economy instead popularised study human behaviour

marshall those used utility analysis theory value
used part theory explain demand curves principle substitution
marshall's scissors analysis combined demand supply utility cost production two blades pair scissors effectively removed theory value center analysis replaced theory price
while term value continued used most people synonym price
prices no longer thought gravitate toward ultimate absolute basis price prices existential relationship demand supply
marshall's influence codifying economic thought difficult deny
popularised use supply demand functions tools price determination previously discovered independently cournot modern economists owe linkage price shifts curve shifts marshall
marshall important part marginalist revolution idea consumers attempt adjust consumption until marginal utility equals price another contributions
price elasticity demand presented marshall extension these ideas

comments made marshall book 4 chapter 10 principles economics used economists economic geographers discuss phenomenon
two dominant characteristics marshallian industrial district high degrees vertical horizontal specialisation very heavy reliance market mechanism exchange
firms tend small focus single function production chain
firms located industrial districts highly competitive neoclassical sense many cases there little product differentiation
major advantages marshallian industrial districts arise simple propinquity firms allows easier recruitment skilled labour rapid exchanges commercial technical information through informal channels
