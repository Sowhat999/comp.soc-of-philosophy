new trade theory prior krugman's work trade theory see david ricardo heckscher–ohlin model emphasized trade based comparative advantage countries very different characteristics such country high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products industrial products country high industrial productivity
however 20 th century ever larger share trade occurred countries similar characteristics difficult explain comparative advantage
krugman's explanation trade similar countries proposed 1979 paper journal international economics involves two key assumptions consumers prefer diverse choice brands production favors economies scale
consumers' preference diversity explains survival different versions cars like volvo bmw
however because economies scale profitable spread production volvos over world instead concentrated few factories therefore few countries maybe just
logic explains how each country may specialize producing few brands any given type product instead specializing different types products
krugman modeled 'preference diversity' assuming ces utility function like 1977 paper avinash dixit joseph stiglitz
many models international trade now follow krugman's lead incorporating economies scale production preference diversity consumption

home market effect states ceteris paribus country larger demand good shall equilibrium produce proportionate share good net exporter

there economies scale production possible countries may become 'locked into' disadvantageous patterns trade
nonetheless trade remains beneficial general even similar countries because permits firms save costs producing larger efficient scale because increases range brands available sharpens competition firms

home market effect krugman discovered ntt also features neg interprets agglomeration outcome interaction increasing returns trade costs factor price differences
trade largely shaped economies scale krugman's trade theory argues then those economic regions most production will profitable will therefore attract even production
ntt implies instead spreading out evenly around world production will tend concentrate few countries regions cities will become densely populated will also higher levels income
