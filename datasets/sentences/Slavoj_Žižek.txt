september 2015 ontology ideology real developing thesis ideology function žižek makes two intertwined arguments begins critique marx's concept ideology described german ideology people beholden false consciousness prevents them seeing how things really
žižek argues continuing althusser ideology thoroughly unconscious ideology functions series justifications spontaneous socio-symbolic rituals support virtual authorities
however real equivalent reality experienced subjects meaningfully ordered totality
žižek real names points within ontological fabric knitted hegemonic systems representation reproduction nevertheless resist full inscription terms may such attempt generate sites active political resistance
drawing lacan's notion barred subject žižek subject purely negative entity void negativity hegelian sense allows flexibility reflexivity cartesian cogito transcendental subject
žižek claims though consciousness opaque following hegel epistemological gap in-itself for-itself immanent reality itself antinomies kant quantum physics badiou's 'materialist' principle 'the not' point towards inconsistent barred real itself lacan conceptualized prior
žižek speaking 2011 žižek argues although there multiple symbolic interpretations real relatively true
žižek identifies two instances real abject real real real cannot wholly integrated symbolic order symbolic real set signifiers never properly integrated horizon sense subject
truth revealed process transiting contradictions real minimal difference gap infinite judgement reductionist materialism experience lived developing thesis parallax dialectical antagonisms inherent reality itself developing dialectical materialism - contra engels - new materialist hegelianism incorporating insights lacanian psychoanalysis set theory quantum physics contemporary continental philosophy most notably magnum opus less nothing hegel shadow dialectical materialism well absolute recoil towards new foundation dialectical materialism 2014
political thought postmodern subject žižek argues state system regulatory institutions shape our behavior
power purely symbolic no normative force outside collective behavior
way term law signifies society's basic principles enable interaction prohibiting certain acts
political decisions žižek become depoliticized accepted natural conclusions
example controversial policy decisions such reductions social welfare spending presented apparently objective necessities
although governments make claims increased citizen participation democracy important decisions still made interests capital
two-party system dominant united states elsewhere produces similar illusion
žižek says still necessary engage particular conflicts—such labor disputes—but trick relate these individual events larger struggle
particular demands executed well might serve metaphorical condensation system injustices
real political conflict žižek ordered structure society those without place
stark contrast intellectual tenets european universalist left general those jürgen habermas defined postnational particular žižek spares no efforts clear unequivocal defense pro-sovereignty pro-independence processes opened europe
žižek argues postmodern subject cynical toward official institutions yet same time believes conspiracies
lost our shared belief single power constructed another other order escape unbearable freedom faced
žižek enough merely know you being lied particularly continuing live normal life under capitalism
although may possess self-awareness žižek argues just because understands doing does mean doing right thing
žižek considers religion enemy rather fields struggle
2006 new york times op-ed made argument atheism arguing religious fundamentalists way no different godless stalinist communists
argued both value divine will salvation over moral ethical action
criticism many hundreds academics addressed aspects žižek's work professional papers 2007 international journal žižek studies established discussion work
there two main themes critique žižek's ideas failure articulate alternative program face denunciation contemporary social political economic arrangements lack rigor argumentation
ambiguity lack alternatives žižek's philosophical political positions clear critiques called out failure take consistent stance
claimed stand revolutionary marxist project lack vision circumstance revolution makes unclear project consists
according theoretical argument often lacks historical fact lends provocation rather insight
žižek's refusal present alternative vision led critics accuse using unsustainable marxist categories analysis having 19 th-century understanding class
example ernesto laclau argued žižek uses class sort deus ex machina play role good guy against multicultural devils
use such analysis however systematic draws critical accounts stalinism maoism well post-structuralism lacanian psychoanalysis
žižek represents two trajectories contemporary thought progressive alternative
side those thinkers like žižek alain badiou embrace communism radical alternative current social political economic arrangements
draw their inspiration social theory marxism extend form radical critique capitalism contemporary politics neoliberalism general
advocate withdrawal žižek's words everyday material social life decry anyone abandons hypothesis communism badiou resigning themselves market economy
roberto mangabeira unger alternative path trodden thinkers like žižek badiou rethinking structural transformation construction alternative vision social arrangements
although žižek unger compared their mutual encounter hegel marx well their experience engagement political life their respective countries unger lack clear vision alternatives contemporary thinkers like žižek represents betrayal our most important attribute our power resist reshape social conceptual worlds find ourselves
žižek does agree critics attribute belief necessitationism stated there no such thing communist big other there's no historical necessity teleology directing guiding our actions
slovene ni komunističnega velikega drugega nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije ki bi usmerjala vodila naša dejanja
book living end times žižek acknowledges part critics being ambiguous multilateral positions
am attacked being anti-semitic spreading zionist lies being covert slovene nationalist unpatriotic traitor my nation being crypto-stalinist defending terror spreading bourgeois lies communism
maybe just maybe am right path path fidelity freedom
unorthodox style scholarship critics complain theoretical chaos questions answers confused žižek constantly recycles old ideas scientifically refuted long ago reality quite different meaning žižek gives them
harpham calls žižek's style stream nonconsecutive units arranged arbitrary sequences solicit sporadic discontinuous attention
o'neill concurs dizzying array wildly entertaining often quite maddening rhetorical strategies deployed order beguile browbeat dumbfound dazzle confuse mislead overwhelm generally subdue reader acceptance
such presentation laid open accusations misreading other philosophers particularly jacques lacan georg wilhelm friedrich hegel
žižek carries over many concepts lacan's teachings sphere political social theory tendency extreme deviation psychoanalytic context
similarly according critics žižek's conflation lacan's unconscious hegel's unconscious mistaken
noah horwitz effort dissociate lacan problematic hegel interprets lacanian unconscious hegelian unconscious two totally different mechanisms
horwitz points out lacan hegel's differing approaches topic speech lacan's unconscious reveals itself us parapraxis slips-of-the-tongue
therefore according lacan alienated language through revelation our desire even desire originated other claims remains peculiar us
hegel's unconscious however alienated language whenever attempt articulate particular end up articulating universal
example say 'the dog me' although am trying say something particular dog particular time actually produce universal category 'dog' therefore express generality particularity desire
hegel's argument implies level sense-certainty never express true nature reality
lacan's argument implies contrary speech reveals true structure particular unconscious mind
very negative review žižek’s magnum opus less nothing british political philosopher john gray attacked žižek celebrations violence failure ground theories historical facts ‘formless radicalism’ according gray professes communist yet lacks conviction communism ever successfully realized
gray concluded žižek’s work though entertaining intellectually worthless 'achieving deceptive substance endlessly reiterating essentially empty vision žižek's work amounts end less nothing
accusations plagiarism 2014 žižek's tendency recycle portions own texts subsequent works resulted accusation self-plagiarism new york times 2014 after žižek published op-ed magazine contained portions writing earlier book
response žižek expressed perplexity harsh tone denunciation emphasizing recycled passages question acted references theoretical books supplement otherwise original writing
july 2014 leading american weekly newsmagazine newsweek reported article published 2006 žižek plagiarized substantial passages earlier review first appeared white nationalist journal american renaissance publication condemned southern poverty law center organ white nationalist hate group
however response allegations žižek stated writing text derrida contains problematic passages friend me kevin macdonald's theories asked send me brief resume
friend send [sic] me assuring me use freely since merely resumes another's line thought
consequently just sincerely apologize knowing my friend's resume largely borrowed stanley hornbeck's review macdonald's book
any reader quickly establish problematic passages purely informative report another's theory no affinity whatsoever after brief resume quickly dismissing macdonald's theory new chapter long process destruction reason
no way thus accused plagiarizing another's line thought stealing ideas
nonetheless deeply regret incident
