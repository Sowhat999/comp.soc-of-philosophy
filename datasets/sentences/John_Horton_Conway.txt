became interested mathematics very early age mother recalled recite powers two four years old
age eleven ambition become mathematician
after leaving secondary school conway entered gonville caius college cambridge study mathematics
conway terribly introverted adolescent school interpreted admission cambridge opportunity transform himself new person extrovert
awarded bachelor arts degree 1959 began undertake research number theory supervised harold davenport
having solved open problem posed davenport writing numbers sums fifth powers conway began become interested infinite ordinals
appears interest games began during years studying cambridge mathematical tripos became avid backgammon player spending hours playing game common room
awarded doctorate 1964 appointed college fellow lecturer mathematics cambridge university
left cambridge 1986 take up appointment john von neumann chair mathematics princeton university
according 2015 biography conway thrice married twice divorced suffered two heart attacks two strokes depression
resides current wife diana princeton
research combinatorial game theory single gosper's glider gun creating gliders conway's game life among amateur mathematicians perhaps most widely known contributions combinatorial game theory cgt theory partisan games
developed elwyn berlekamp richard guy them also co-authored book winning ways your mathematical plays
also book numbers games onag lays out mathematical foundations cgt
also inventors sprouts well philosopher's football
developed detailed analyses many other games puzzles such soma cube peg solitaire conway's soldiers
came up angel problem solved 2006
invented new system numbers surreal numbers closely related certain games subject mathematical novel donald knuth
also invented nomenclature exceedingly large numbers conway chained arrow notation
much discussed 0 th part onag
also known invention conway's game life early examples cellular automaton
early experiments field done pen paper long before personal computers existed
geometry mid-1960 s michael guy son richard guy established there sixty-four convex uniform polychora excluding two infinite sets prismatic forms
discovered grand antiprism process non-wythoffian uniform polychoron
conway also suggested system notation dedicated describing polyhedra called conway polyhedron notation
extensively investigated lattices higher dimensions determined symmetry group leech lattice
geometric topology conway's approach computing alexander polynomial knot theory involved skein relations variant now called alexander-conway polynomial
after lying dormant decade concept became central work 1980 s novel knot polynomials
conway further developed tangle theory invented system notation tabulating knots nowadays known conway notation while correcting number errors 19 th century knot tables extending them include four non-alternating primes crossings [topology proceedings 7 1982 118]
group theory worked classification finite simple groups discovered conway groups
primary author atlas finite groups giving properties many finite simple groups
along collaborators constructed first concrete representations sporadic groups
specifically discovered three sporadic groups based symmetry leech lattice designated conway groups
simon p
norton formulated complex conjectures relating monster group modular functions named monstrous moonshine them
introduced mathieu groupoid extension mathieu group m12 13 points
number theory graduate student proved conjecture edward waring every integer written sum 37 numbers each raised fifth power though chen jingrun solved problem independently before work published
algebra also done work algebra particularly quaternions
together neil sloane invented icosians
algorithmics calculating day week invented doomsday algorithm
algorithm simple enough anyone basic arithmetic ability calculations mentally
conway usually give correct answer under two seconds
improve speed practices calendrical calculations computer programmed quiz random dates every time logs
early books finite state machines
theoretical physics 2004 conway simon
kochen another princeton mathematician proved free will theorem startling version 'no hidden variables' principle quantum mechanics
states given certain conditions experimenter freely decide quantities measure particular experiment then elementary particles must free choose their spins make measurements consistent physical law
conway's provocative wording experimenters free will then elementary particles
books co-written several books including atlas finite groups regular algebra finite machines sphere packings lattices groups sensual quadratic form numbers games winning ways your mathematical plays book numbers quaternions octonions triangle book written steve sigur summer 2008 published symmetries things chaim goodman-strauss heidi burgiel
awards honours conway received berwick prize 1971 elected fellow royal society 1981 first recipient pólya prize lms 1987 won nemmers prize mathematics 1998 received leroy p
steele prize mathematical exposition 2000 american mathematical society
nomination reads versatile mathematician combines deep combinatorial insight algebraic virtuosity particularly construction manipulation off-beat algebraic structures illuminate wide variety problems completely unexpected ways
made distinguished contributions theory finite groups theory knots mathematical logic both set theory automata theory theory games also practice
