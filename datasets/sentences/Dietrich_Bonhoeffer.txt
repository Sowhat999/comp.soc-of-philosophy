purported witness doctor flossenbürg concentration camp hermann fischer-hüllstrung may wished minimize suffering condemned men reduce own culpability their executions
mogensen former prisoner flossenbürg cited length time took execution completed almost six hours plus departures ordinary camp procedure hardly allowed prisoners late war jarring inconsistencies
considering sentences confirmed highest levels nazi government individuals pattern torturing prisoners dared challenge regime likely physical details bonhoeffer's death may much difficult earlier imagined
other recent critics traditional account caustic
terms fischer-hüllstrung story unfortunately lie citing additional factual inconsistencies doctor described bonhoeffer climbing steps noose flossenbürg gallows none observing fischer-hüllstrung job reviving political prisoners after hanged until almost dead order prolong agony their dying
