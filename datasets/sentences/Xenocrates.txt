xenocrates adhered closely platonist doctrine accounted typical representative old academy
writings numerous seems covered nearly whole academic program metaphysics ethics subjects principally engaged thoughts
made explicit division philosophy three parts physics dialectic ethics
writings comprehensive work dialectic τῆς περὶ τὸ διαλέγεσθαι πραγματείας βιϐλία ιδ΄ there also separate treatises knowledge knowledgibility περὶ ἐπιστήμης α΄ περὶ ἐπιστημοσύνης α΄ divisions διαιρέσεις η΄ genera species περὶ γενῶν καὶ εἰδῶν α΄ ideas περὶ ἰδεῶν opposite περὶ τοῦ ἐναντίου others probably work mediate thought τῶν περὶ τὴν διάνοιαν η΄ also belonged

besides philosophical treatises poetry epē paraenesis
philosophy epistemology xenocrates made definite division three departments philosophy speusippus same time abandoned plato's heuristic method conducting through doubts aporiai adopted instead mode bringing forward doctrines developed dogmatically
xenocrates recognized three grades cognition each appropriated region own knowledge sensation opinion
referred knowledge episteme essence object pure thought included phenomenal world sensation aisthesis passes world phenomena opinion doxa essence once object sensuous perception mathematically pure reason - essence heaven stars conceived doxa higher sense endeavoured definitely plato exhibit mathematics mediating knowledge sensuous perception
three modes apprehension partake truth manner scientific perception epistemonike aisthesis unfortunately learn
even here xenocrates's preference symbolic modes sensualising denoting appears connected above three stages knowledge three fates atropos clotho lachesis
know nothing further mode xenocrates carried out dialectic probable peculiar aristotelian logic remain unnoticed hardly doubted division existent absolutely existent relatively existent attributed xenocrates opposed aristotelian table categories
metaphysics know plutarch xenocrates explain platonic construction world-soul crantor after nevertheless drew heavily timaeus further head those regarding universe unoriginated imperishable looked upon chronological succession platonic theory form denote relations conceptual succession
plutarch unfortunately does give us any further details contented himself describing well-known assumption xenocrates soul self-moving number
probably should connect statement xenocrates called unity duality monas duas deities characterised former first male existence ruling heaven father zeus uneven number spirit latter female mother gods soul universe reigns over mutable world under heaven others named zeus ever remains like himself governing sphere immutable highest rules over mutable sublunary world last outermost
like other platonists designated material principle undefined duality world-soul probably described first defined duality conditioning defining principle every separate definitude sphere material changeable extending beyond
appears called highest sense individual soul derivative sense self-moving number first number endowed motion
world-soul zeus world-spirit entrusted - degree extent learn - dominion over liable motion change
divine power world-soul then again represented different spheres universe infusing soul planets sun moon - purer form shape olympic gods
sublunary daemonical power hera poseidon demeter dwells elements these daemonical natures midway gods men related them isosceles triangle equilateral scalene
divine world-soul reigns over whole domain sublunary changes appears designated last zeus last divine activity
until get sphere separate daemonical powers nature opposition good evil begins daemonical power appeased means stubbornness finds there congenial good daemonical power makes happy those whom takes up abode bad ruins them eudaimonia indwelling good daemon opposite indwelling bad
how xenocrates tried establish connect scientifically these assumptions appear taken chiefly books nature gods learn discover fundamental idea basis them grades existence penetrated divine power grows less less energetic proportion descends perishable individual
hence also appears maintained far consciousness extends far also extends intuition all-ruling divine power represented even irrational animals partaking
neither thick nor thin different combinations appears tried refer various grades material existence regarded themselves partaking soul doubtless because referred them immediately divine activity far attempting reconcile duality principia resolve them original unity
hence too proving incorporeality soul fact nourished body
probable after example plato designated divine principium alone indivisible remaining like itself material divisible partaking multiformity different union two limitation unlimited absolute unity deduced number reason called soul universe like individual beings self-moving number virtue twofold root same different shares equally permanence motion attains consciousness means reconciliation opposition
aristotle metaphysics recognized amongst contemporary platonists three principal views concerning ideal numbers their relation ideas mathematical numbers those like plato distinguished ideal mathematical numbers those like xenocrates identified ideal numbers mathematical numbers those like speusippus postulated mathematical numbers aristotle much say against xenocratean interpretation theory particular points out ideal numbers made up arithmetical units cease principles also become subject arithmetical operations
derivation things according series numbers seems gone further any predecessors
approximated pythagoreans clear explanation soul regarded number conditioning principle consciousness consequently knowledge also thought necessary however supply wanting pythagorean assumption accurate definition borrowed plato insofar number reconciles opposition same different raised itself self-motion soul
find similar attempt supplementation platonic doctrine xenocrates's assumption indivisible lines
them thought discovered according plato god alone knows among men loved namely elements principia platonic triangles
seems described them first original lines similar sense spoken original plain figures bodies convinced principia existent should sought material divisible attains condition phenomenon merely ideal definitude form
may very well accordance regarded point merely subjectively admissible presupposition passage aristotle respecting assumption should perhaps referred
ethics information ethics scanty
tried supplement platonic doctrine various points same time give direct applicability life
distinguished good bad something neither good nor bad
following ideas academic predecessors viewed good should striven after itself value itself while bad opposite
consequently neither good nor bad itself neither striven after nor avoided derives value opposite according serves means good bad rather used us purpose
xenocrates depicted medieval scholar nuremberg chronicle while however xenocrates speusippus other philosophers older academy accept these intermediate things such health beauty fame good fortune etc
valuable themselves accept absolutely worthless indifferent
according therefore belongs intermediate region adapted bring hinder good xenocrates appears designated good evil probably proviso misuse good might become evil vice versa virtue evil might become good
still maintained virtue alone valuable itself value every thing else conditional
according happiness should coincide consciousness virtue though reference relations human life requires additional condition enjoyment good things circumstances originally designed nature attains completion these good things however sensuous gratification does belong
sense hand denoted perfect happiness possession personal virtue capabilities adapted therefore reckoned among constituent elements besides moral actions conditions facilities those movements relations also without external good things cannot attained other hand allow wisdom understood science first causes intelligible essence theoretical understanding itself true wisdom should striven after people therefore seems regarded human wisdom same time exerted investigating defining applying
how decidedly insisted recognition unconditional nature moral excellence morality thought shown declaration comes same thing whether casts longing eyes sets one's feet upon property others
moral earnestness also expressed warning ears children should guarded against poison immoral speeches
mathematics xenocrates known written book numbers theory numbers besides books geometry
plutarch writes xenocrates once attempted find total number syllables made letters alphabet
according plutarch xenocrates result 1002000000000 myriad-and-twenty times myriad-myriad
possibly represents first instance combinatorial problem involving permutations attempted
xenocrates also supported idea indivisible lines magnitudes order counter zeno's paradoxes
