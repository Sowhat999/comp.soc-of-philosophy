poem essentially history spiritual development poet day came believe every pulse life died out soul moment lyrical sentimental reawakened
strange torpor rendered apathetic indifferent suffering love desire hope
life seemed desolate until ice began melt soul reawakening finally felt revivification ancient illusions

silvia tower recanati present il passero solitario 1828 leopardi composed perhaps most famous poem silvia silvia
young lady title—possibly daughter servant leopardi household—is image hopes illusions young poet destined succumb far too early struggle against reality just youth silvia destroyed tuberculosis chiuso morbo
often asked whether leopardi actually love young woman seek confirmation biographical evidence miss point poem
silvia expression profound tragic love life itself leopardi despite suffering psychological torments negative philosophizing suppress spirit
poem demonstrates why leopardi's so-called nihilism does run deep enough touch well-spring poetry love man nature beauty

also delegates dignities onto crowd nor grieving himself sorrows obsessed afterwards prowess dominates

canto notturno di un pastore errante dell'asia around end 1829 first months 1830 leopardi composed canto notturno di un pastore errante dell'asia night-time chant wandering asian sheep-herder
writing piece leopardi drew inspiration reading voyage d'orenbourg à boukhara fait en 1820 russian baron meyendorff baron tells how certain sheep-herders central asia belonging kirghiz population practiced sort ritual chant consisting long sweet strophes directed full moon
canto divided five strophes equal length takes form dialogue sheep-herder moon
nevertheless canto begins words che fai tu luna ciel? dimmi che fai / silenziosa luna? you moon sky? tell me you / silent moon?
throughout entire poem fact moon remains silent dialogue transformed therefore long urgent existential monologue sheep-herder desperate search explanations provide sense pointlessness existence
two characters immersed indeterminate space time accentuating universal symbolic nature their encounter sheep-herder represents human species whole doubts contingent—that anchored here now—but rather characteristic man times moon other hand represents nature beautiful terrible force fascinates same time terrifies poet
sheep-herder man humble condition directs words moon polite insistent tone seething melancholy
precisely absence response part celestial orb provokes continue investigate ever profoundly role moon therefore humanity respect life world defining ever sharply arid truth dear poetry leopardi
first strophe fact sheep-herder even while defining moon silent actually expects response discovers many analogies own condition moon both them arise morning follow their self-identical paths finally stop rest
life moon much sheep-herder seems completely senseless
there appears however middle strophe very important distinction course human life finite passage similar vecchierel bianco petrarch canzoniere xvi terminates tragically horrid abyss death
such condition defined second strophe condition profound suffering se vita è sventura perché da noi si dura? extremely different moon seems instead eternal virgin intact
third strophe sheep-herder turns again moon renewed vigor hope believing orb precisely because privileged extra-worldly condition provide answers most urgent questions life? possibly purpose since necessarily finite? first cause being? moon sheep-herder learns quickly cannot provide answers these questions even knew them since such nature distant incomprehensible mute indifferent concerns man
sheep-herder's search sense happiness continues way final two strophes
fourth sheep-herder turns flock observing how lack self-awareness each sheep allows live out apparent tranquillity brief existence without suffering boredom
idea ultimately rejected sheep-herder himself final strophe admits probably whatever form life born manifests itself whether moon sheep man whatever capable doing life equally bleak tragic
period leopardi's relations family reduced minimum constrained maintain himself own financially
1830 after sixteen months notte orribile awful night accepted generous offer tuscan friends enabled leave recanati
last canti 1832–1837 last canti philosophical investigation predominates exception tramonto della luna decline moon decisive return idyllic lyricism
il pensiero dominante 1831 leopardi il pensiero dominante dominating thought exalts love living vitalizing force itself even unrequited
poem however features desire love without joy vitalizing spirit therefore remaining thought illusion
leopardi destroys everything condemns everything wishes save love universal miasma protect least within profundity own soul
desolate solitude surrounds tightly grasps onto love faith idealized illusory eternal woman sua donna placates suffering disillusion bitterness
poet universal suffering sings good surpasses ills life instant seems become singer possible happiness
idea death hope man returns since world offers two beautiful things love death
il pensiero dominante represents first ecstatic moment love almost nullifies awareness human unhappiness
worth price tolerating suffering long life order experience joy such beauty
il pensiero dominante il risorgimento poems joy written leopardi though even those two poems there reappears inextinguishable pessimism sees object joy vain image created imagination
amore e morte concept love-death duality taken up again 1832 canto amore e morte love death
meditation torment annihilation accompanies love
love death fact twins generator things beautiful other puts end ills
love makes strong cancels fear death dominates soul makes desire death
won over passion will die happily
others kill themselves because wounds love
happiness consists dying drunkenness passion
two twins leopardi dares invoke death no longer symbolized horrid ade saffo young virgin grants peace eternity
death sister love great consoler along her brother best world offer
consalvo fanny targioni tozzetti also 1832 inspired 17 th-century poem girolamo graziani titled conquista di granada capture granada leopardi consalvo
consalvo obtains kiss woman long loved unrequitedly gravely injured point death
consalvo different other canti form novella verse dramatic scene
fruit sentimental languid literature characterized much romanticism outside italy
aspasia written 1834 aspasia emerges like consalvo painful experience desperate unrequited love fanny targioni tozzetti
aspasia-fanny real woman represented poetry leopardi
aspasia able manipulator whose perfect body hides corrupt prosaic soul
she demonstration beauty dishonest
poet vainly searching love takes revenge destiny women rejected above targioni whose memory continues disturb poet after year away her
memory woman loved vain constantly returns canto inspired disdain provocative simultaneously distancing behavior woman also expresses resignation one's fate pride having able recover one's own independence
aspasia her limitedness woman cannot grasp profundity masculine thought
se stesso se stesso himself 1833 canto leopardi talks heart
last deceit love dead too
thought love few things makes life worth living changed mind after beloved fanny's refusal
she moreover love antonio ranieri leopardi's best friend remained poet until end
desire hope sweet deceits ended
heart beaten life it's time stop beating staying still
there no place hope anymore
wants dying because death good gift nature given human beings
love death love still considered good thing because you love you stronger feelings you feel alive new way
now became skeptical also love because can't fanny nothing remains life
just wants die make suffering end
death gift end human pain inevitable because it's essence men it's cruel project nature
last verse e l'infinita vanità del tutto means infinite vanity whole indicates inanity human life human world
sopra un bassorilievo antico sepolcrale canto sopra un bassorilievo antico sepolcrale over ancient sepulchre bas-relief young woman died represented act saying goodbye her loved ones
poet weighs pros cons death remaining doubt whether young woman's destiny good bad
leopardi even while being highly conscious indifference nature never ceased entirely love
these verses poet poses challenging pointed questions nature enumerating ills sufferings because death inflicted humanity
under influence love poet apparently found happiness least death il pensiero dominante amore e morte
now instead even last illusion fallen sees nothing unhappiness everywhere
sopra il ritratto di una bella donna sopra il ritratto di una bella donna scolpito nel monumento sepolcrale della medesima portrait beautiful woman sculpted her sepulchral monument basically extension above
poet drawing inspiration funerary sculpture evokes image beautiful woman compares her breathtaking beauty heart-rendingly sad image she become no mud dust skeleton
well being centred transience beauty human things poem points specular antinomy human ideals natural truth
leopardi does deny—if anything emphasizes—the beauty human species general end poem extends point possible forms beauty intellectual well aesthetic
however universal beauty remains unattainable human nature nothing polvere e ombra dust shadow may touch—but never possess—the ideals perceives remaining rooted natural world born well demands

canto leopardi expresses vast thought mankind history nature autobiographical elements found both direct places described those surround poet late years indirect image man poor weak courageous enough aware real condition
humble plant ginestra living desolate places without surrendering force nature resembles ideal man rejects any illusions himself does invoke heaven nature impossible help
vesuvius great mountain brings destruction dominates entire poem
attainable truth death toward man must inexorably advance abandoning every illusion becoming conscious own miserable condition
such awareness will placate mutual hatreds
vast poem symphonically constructed brilliant alternations tone grandiose tragic painting volcano threatening destruction extensions infertile lava sharp ideological argumentation cosmic sparks project nothingness earth man immensity universe vision infinite passage centuries human history immutable threat nature weighed gentle notes dedicated flower desert compressed complex symbolic meanings pity toward sufferings man dignity should characteristic man confronted invincible force nature crushes
essential change occurs ginestra closes poetic career leopardi along il tramonto della luna takes up old themes fall youthful illusions
poem reiterates reaffirms sharp anti-optimistic anti-religious polemic new democratic register
here leopardi no longer denies possibility civic progress seeks construct idea progress founded precisely pessimism
il tramonto della luna il tramonto della luna waning moon last canto composed leopardi naples shortly before death
moon wanes leaving nature total darkness just youth passes away leaving life dark derelict

leopardi 1831 1835 beginning during last stay florence finishing naples
publication took place posthumously paris 1842 provoking universal reaction outrage condemnation much cutting anti-heroic representation events risorgimento numerous materialistic philosophical digressions
term paralipòmeni greek things left undone unsaid
batracomiomachìa means war frogs mice
batracomiomachia also title pseudo-homeric poem actually written 4 th 5 th century bc translated leopardi 1815 1826
title therefore alludes integration original work taken up again left off narrative progresses
subject fable regarding conflict mice inhabit nation topaia invading crabs
behind plot there hidden robust sarcastic polemical motivation
animals their doings allegorical value
crabs portrayed unsympathetically monstrous characteristics recognized austrians mice sometimes generous mostly ingenuous cowardly liberal italians
poem represents historical events took place 1815 1821 climate restoration desired holy alliance fruitless attempts insurrection 1820–21
even revolutionary movements 1831 included leopardi able follow them way moderate tuscan circles frequented perhaps provided inspiration work
adoption poetic genre required abandonment lyric style adoption narrative pace marked constant critical-satirical tension toward ideological philosophical beliefs contemporary culture christian spiritualism faith progress anthropocentrism
even slogans political struggle liberals derided both their expression expectation foreign intervention their faith model constitutional monarchy
fashion paralipomeni represent another part leopardi's polemical war present above exceptional sally territory historical/political commentary generally confronted leopardi direct form
italian risorgimento delineates fundamental limits here extraordinary tempestivity tendency compromise ancient interests constituted powers vanity opportunism ideological ingenuousness lack opportune pragmatic awareness
style generally renounces expressive concentration lyric texts extends itself wide relaxed discursive pace alterations adventurous moments ferociously caricatural polemical points description philosophical digressions
