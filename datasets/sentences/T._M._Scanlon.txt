contractualism contractualism attempt providing unified account subject matter central part morality scanlon calls ‘what owe each other’
normative domain owe each other meant encompass those duties other people bear virtue their standing rational creatures
broader conception morality includes whatever else may owe specific people such special obligations bear relations friends family whatever else morality may require us such way treat ourselves nature
scanlon believes owe each other loosely call ‘the morality right wrong’ distinct broader conception morality contractualism provides unified account content begin our description scanlon’s contractualism noting judgements right wrong unlike empirical judgements theoretical claims nature spatiotemporal world rather practical claims reason
further particularly important class practical claims judgement action wrong taken provide reasons action most often considered decisive against competing reasons
following point scanlon takes questions reason-giving force moral judgements prior questions subject matter morality right wrong
explicitly thinks provide account extraordinary reason-giving force moral judgements then account largely form basis characterisation subject matter owe each other
scanlon grounds reason-giving force judgements right wrong ‘the positive value way living others’
way living others typified ideal mutual recognition rational agents mutual recognition demands moral agents acknowledge value human life respond value right ways
how ought value human rational life? scanlon argues persuasively different valuable things require different ways valuing
contrast teleological accounts value often take something value see reason bring maximal amount thing
especially true come consider value human life
value human life see reason create much human life
rather tend see reason respect other human beings protect them death other forms harm general want their lives go well
important scanlon value rational life recognise features distinguish rational life other valuable things specifically ability rational creatures assess reasons judgements govern their lives accordance these assessments
scanlon asserts proper response recognition these distinctive features treat rational creatures terms principles reasonably reject
point scanlon’s account value rational life provides locus around account reason-giving force moral judgements dovetails quite neatly characterisation method reasoning use arrive judgements right wrong method moreover seems phenomenologically plausible
reason-giving force moral judgements grounded ideal mutual recognition requires treating others accordance principles reasonably reject
because mutual recognition requires these other people also appropriately motivated entails scanlon’s formulation wrongness ‘an act wrong any principle permitted reasonably rejected people moved find principles general regulation behaviour others similarly motivated reasonably reject’
will call contractualist formulation
act right quite simply principle permitting reasonably rejected terms aforementioned formulation
few rather discordant summary comments needed regarding how moral principles derived contractualist formulation
considering whether principle rejected must take account consequences general being accepted consequences particular actions allows
because cannot sure will affected principle how will affected must draw our experience life consider ‘generic reasons’ individuals likely result their general circumstances reject principle
order determine whether principle reasonably rejectable must impartially weigh these generic reasons against each other exercising our judgement draw conclusion weight reasons support
given motivation finding principles general regulation society no-one reasonably reject weight reasons support certain conclusion then unreasonable reject conclusion
importantly principles rejected individuals aggregation reasons across individuals allowed
generic reasons individual carry weight then any other individual’s generic reasons then generic reasons most partdecisive determining principles
generic reasons open consideration under contractualist formulation any reasons judge relevant reasonable rejectability
requires exercise our judgement determining whether such reasons suitable grounds mutual recognition
therefore principle negatively affect person’s well-being kind reason may brought against principle
other considerations such how burden imposed principle serve reasonable grounds rejection
finally while contractualism provides account central part morality deals owe each other scanlon observes part morality related broader realm morality complex ways
there pressure morality owe each other acknowledge values included broader realm morality insofar principles don’t make room these values reasonably rejected
turn these values must accommodate dictates owe each other extent involve relations others separate moral standing
