al-farabi represented religion symbolic rendering truth like plato saw duty philosopher provide guidance state
al-farabi incorporated platonic view drawing parallel within islamic context regarded ideal state ruled prophet-imam instead philosopher-king envisaged plato
al-farabi argued ideal state city-state medina governed prophet muhammad head state direct communion allah whose law revealed

amongst these number prolegomena philosophy commentaries important aristotelian works such nicomachean ethics well own works
ideas marked their coherency despite drawing together many different philosophical disciplines traditions
other significant influences work planetary model ptolemy elements neo-platonism particularly metaphysics practical political philosophy bears resemblance plato's republic aristotle's politics

zimmermann published 1981
farabi great influence maimonides most important jewish thinker middle ages
maimonides arabic treatise logic celebrated maqala fi sina al-mantiq
wonderfully concise way work treats essentials aristotelian logic light comments made persian philosophers avicenna above al-farabi
use maimonides’ words aristotle first master second undoubtedly farabi
rémi brague book devoted treatise stresses fact farabi thinker mentioned therein
al-farabi well ibn sina averroes recognized peripatetics al-mashsha’iyun rationalists estedlaliun among muslims
however tried gather ideas plato aristotle book gathering ideas two philosophers
according adamson work singularly directed towards goal simultaneously reviving reinventing alexandrian philosophical tradition christian teacher yuhanna bin haylan belonged
success should measured honorific title second master philosophy aristotle being first known
interestingly adamson also says does make any reference ideas either al-kindi contemporary abu bakr al-razi clearly indicates consider their approach philosophy correct viable
thought metaphysics cosmology contrast al-kindi considered subject metaphysics god al-farabi believed concerned primarily being qua being being itself related god extent god principle absolute being
al-kindi's view however common misconception regarding greek philosophy amongst muslim intellectuals time reason avicenna remarked understand aristotle's metaphysics properly until read prolegomenon written al-farabi
al-farabi's cosmology essentially based upon three pillars aristotelian metaphysics causation highly developed plotinian emanational cosmology ptolemaic astronomy
model universe viewed number concentric circles outermost sphere first heaven sphere fixed stars saturn jupiter mars sun venus mercury finally moon
centre these concentric circles sub-lunar realm contains material world
each these circles represent domain secondary intelligences symbolized celestial bodies themselves act causal intermediaries first cause case god material world
furthermore these emanated god both their formal efficient cause
process emanation begins metaphysically temporally first cause whose principal activity self-contemplation
intellectual activity underlies role creation universe
first cause thinking itself overflows incorporeal entity second intellect emanates
like predecessor second intellect also thinks itself thereby brings celestial sphere case sphere fixed stars being addition must also contemplate upon first cause causes emanation next intellect
cascade emanation continues until reaches tenth intellect beneath material world
each intellect must contemplate both itself increasing number predecessors each succeeding level existence becomes complex
should noted process based upon necessity opposed will
other words god does choice whether create universe virtue own existence causes
view also suggests universe eternal both these points criticized al-ghazzali attack philosophers discussion first cause god al-farabi relies heavily negative theology
says cannot known intellectual means such dialectical division definition because terms used these processes define thing constitute substance
therefore define first cause each terms used actually constitute part substance therefore behave cause existence impossible first cause uncaused exists without being caused
equally says cannot known according genus differentia substance existence different others therefore no category belongs
case then first cause because something prior existence also impossible
suggest philosophically simple thing perfect
based observation adamson says possible see entire hierarchy al-farabi's cosmology according classification genus species
each succeeding level structure principal qualities multiplicity deficiency ever-increasing complexity typifies material world
epistemology eschatology human beings unique al-farabi's vision universe because stand two worlds higher immaterial world celestial intellects universal intelligibles lower material world generation decay inhabit physical body belong lower world also rational capacity connects them higher realm
each level existence al-farabi's cosmology characterized movement towards perfection become like first cause perfect intellect
human perfection happiness then equated constant intellection contemplation
al-farabi divides intellect four categories potential actual acquired agent
first three different states human intellect fourth tenth intellect moon emanational cosmology
potential intellect represents capacity think shared human beings actual intellect intellect engaged act thinking
thinking al-farabi means abstracting universal intelligibles sensory forms objects apprehended retained individual's imagination
motion potentiality actuality requires agent intellect act upon retained sensory forms just sun illuminates physical world allow us see agent intellect illuminates world intelligibles allow us think
illumination removes accident such time place quality physicality them converting them primary intelligibles logical principles such whole greater part
human intellect act intellection passes potentiality actuality gradually comprehends these intelligibles identified them according aristotle knowing something intellect becomes like
because agent intellect knows intelligibles means human intellect knows them becomes associated agent intellect's perfection known acquired intellect
while process seems mechanical leaving little room human choice volition reisman says al-farabi committed human voluntarism
takes place man based knowledge acquired decides whether direct himself towards virtuous unvirtuous activities thereby decides whether seek true happiness
choosing ethical contemplating constitutes nature ethics actual intellect become like active intellect thereby attaining perfection
process human soul may survive death live afterlife
according al-farabi afterlife personal experience commonly conceived religious traditions such islam christianity
any individual distinguishing features soul annihilated after death body rational faculty survives then attained perfection becomes other rational souls within agent intellect enters realm pure intelligence
henry corbin compares eschatology ismaili neo-platonists whom process initiated next grand cycle universe
however deborah black mentions cause skeptical whether mature developed view al-farabi later thinkers such ibn tufayl averroes ibn bajjah assert repudiated view commentary nicomachean ethics lost modern experts
psychology soul prophetic knowledge treatment human soul al-farabi draws basic aristotelian outline informed commentaries later greek thinkers
says composed four faculties appetitive desire aversion object sense sensitive perception senses corporeal substances imaginative faculty retains images sensible objects after perceived then separates combines them number ends rational faculty intellection
last these unique human beings distinguishes them plants animals
also part soul survive death body
noticeably absent these scheme internal senses such common sense discussed later philosophers such avicenna averroes
special attention must given al-farabi's treatment soul's imaginative faculty essential interpretation prophethood prophetic knowledge
addition ability retain manipulate sensible images objects gives imagination function imitation
means capacity represent object image other own
other words imitate x imagine x associating sensible qualities describe own appearance
extends representative ability imagination beyond sensible forms include temperaments emotions desires even immaterial intelligibles abstract universals happens example associates evil darkness
prophet addition own intellectual capacity very strong imaginative faculty allows receive overflow intelligibles agent intellect tenth intellect emanational cosmology
these intelligibles then associated symbols images allow communicate abstract truths way understood ordinary people
therefore makes prophetic knowledge unique content also accessible philosophers through demonstration intellection rather form given prophet's imagination
practical philosophy ethics politics practical application philosophy major concern expressed al-farabi many works while majority philosophical output influenced aristotelian thought practical philosophy unmistakably based plato
similar manner plato's republic al-farabi emphasizes philosophy both theoretical practical discipline labeling those philosophers apply their erudition practical pursuits futile philosophers
ideal society says directed towards realization true happiness taken mean philosophical enlightenment such ideal philosopher must hone necessary arts rhetoric poetics communicate abstract truths ordinary people well having achieved enlightenment himself
al-farabi compares philosopher's role relation society physician relation body body's health affected balance humours just city determined moral habits people
philosopher's duty says establish virtuous society healing souls people establishing justice guiding them towards true happiness
course al-farabi realizes such society rare requires very specific set historical circumstances realized means very few societies ever attain goal
divides those vicious societies fallen short ideal virtuous society three categories ignorant wicked errant
ignorant societies whatever reason failed comprehend purpose human existence supplanted pursuit happiness another inferior goal whether wealth sensual gratification power
interesting note democratic societies also fall category too lack any guiding principle
both wicked errant societies understood true human end failed follow
former because willfully abandoned latter because their leaders deceived misguided them
al-farabi also makes mention weeds virtuous society those people try undermine progress towards true human end
best known arabic source al-farabi's political philosophy work titled al-madina al-fadila virtuous city
whether al-farabi actually intended outline political programme writings remains matter dispute amongst academics
henry corbin considers al-farabi crypto-shi'ite says ideas should understood prophetic philosophy instead being interpreted politically
other hand charles butterworth contends nowhere work does al-farabi speak prophet-legislator revelation even word philosophy scarcely mentioned main discussion takes place concerns positions king statesmen
occupying middle position david reisman like corbin believes al-farabi want expound political doctrine although does go far attribute islamic gnosticism either
argues al-farabi using different types society examples context ethical discussion show effect correct incorrect thinking
lastly joshua parens argues al-farabi slyly asserting pan-islamic society made using reason show how many conditions such moral deliberative virtue met thus leading reader conclude humans fit such society
other authors like mykhaylo yakubovych attest al-farabi religion milla philosophy falsafa constituted same praxeological value
basis amal al-fadhil—virtuous deed while epistemological level ilm—knowledge different
