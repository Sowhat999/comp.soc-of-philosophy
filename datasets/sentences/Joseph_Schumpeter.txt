served faculty advisor graduate economics club organized private seminars discussion groups
colleagues thought views outdated keynesianism fashionable others resented criticisms particularly their failure offer assistant professorship paul samuelson recanted thought likely accept position yale university
period life characterized hard work comparatively little recognition massive 2-volume book business cycles
however schumpeters persevered 1942 published became most popular works capitalism socialism democracy reprinted many times many languages following decades well cited thousands times

central contributions influences source joseph schumpeter's dynamic change-oriented innovation-based economics historical school economics
although writings critical school schumpeter's work role innovation entrepreneurship seen continuation ideas originated historical school especially work gustav von schmoller werner sombart
evolutionary economics main article evolutionary economics according christopher freeman 2009 scholar devoted much time researching schumpeter's work central point whole life work [is] capitalism understood evolutionary process continuous innovation 'creative destruction'
history economic analysis schumpeter's scholarship apparent posthumous history economic analysis although judgments seem idiosyncratic sometimes cavalier
instance schumpeter thought greatest 18 th century economist turgot adam smith many consider considered léon walras greatest economists beside whom other economists' theories like inadequate attempts catch particular aspects walrasian truth
schumpeter criticized john maynard keynes david ricardo ricardian vice
according schumpeter ricardo keynes reasoned terms abstract models freeze few variables
then argue caused other simple monotonic fashion
led belief easily deduce policy conclusions directly highly abstract theoretical model
book joseph schumpeter recognized implication gold monetary standard compared fiat monetary standard
history economic analysis schumpeter stated following 'automatic' gold currency part parcel laissez-faire free-trade economy
links every nation's money rates price levels money-rates price levels other nations 'on gold
extremely sensitive government expenditure even attitudes policies involve expenditure directly example foreign policy certain policies taxation general precisely those policies violate principles [classical] liberalism
reason why gold unpopular now also why popular bourgeois era
business cycles schumpeter's relationships ideas other economists quite complex most important contributions economic analysis theory business cycles development
following neither walras nor keynes schumpeter starts theory economic development treatise circular flow excluding any innovations innovative activities leads stationary state
stationary state according schumpeter described walrasian equilibrium
hero story entrepreneur
proposed economic waves cycle/wave name period years kitchin cycle inventory e
pork cycle 3–5 juglar cycle fixed investment 7–11 kuznets swing infrastructural investment 15–25 kondratiev wave technological basis 45–60 box viewtalkedit entrepreneur disturbs equilibrium prime cause economic development proceeds cyclic fashion along several time scales
fashioning theory connecting innovations cycles development schumpeter kept alive russian nikolai kondratiev's ideas 50-year cycles kondratiev waves
schumpeter suggested model four main cycles kondratiev 54 years kuznets 18 years juglar 9 years kitchin 4 years added together form composite waveform
actually there considerable professional rivalry schumpeter kuznets
wave form suggested here include kuznets cycle simply because schumpeter recognize valid cycle
[clarification needed] see business cycle further information
kondratiev wave consist three lower degree kuznets waves
each kuznets wave itself made up two juglar waves
similarly two three kitchin waves form higher degree juglar wave
each these phase importantly downward arc each simultaneous nadir each coincident explain disastrous slumps consequent depressions
far segmentation kondratiev wave schumpeter never proposed such fixed model
saw these cycles varying time although tight time frame coincidence each serve specific purpose
keynesianism schumpeter's theory walrasian equilibrium adequate capture key mechanisms economic development
schumpeter also thought institution enabling entrepreneur buy resources needed realize her vision well-developed capitalist financial system including whole range institutions granting credit
divide economists among those emphasized real analysis regarded money merely veil 2 those thought monetary institutions important money separate driving force
both schumpeter keynes among latter
[citation needed] demise capitalism schumpeter's most popular book english probably capitalism socialism democracy
while agrees karl marx capitalism will collapse replaced socialism schumpeter predicts different way will come
while marx predicted capitalism overthrown violent proletarian revolution actually occurred least capitalist countries schumpeter believed capitalism gradually weaken itself eventually collapse
specifically success capitalism lead corporatism values hostile capitalism especially among intellectuals
intellectuals social class position critique societal matters directly responsible stand up interests other classes
intellectuals tend negative outlook capitalism even while relying prestige because their professions rely antagonism toward
growing number people higher education great advantage capitalism according schumpeter
yet unemployment lack fulfilling work will cause intellectual critique discontent protests
parliaments will increasingly elect social democratic parties democratic majorities will vote restrictions entrepreneurship
increasing workers' self-management industrial democracy regulatory institutions evolve non-politically liberal capitalism
thus intellectual social climate needed thriving entrepreneurship will replaced form laborism
will restrict creative destruction borrowed phrase denote endogenous replacement old ways doing things new ways will burden destroy capitalist structure
schumpeter emphasizes throughout book analyzing trends engaging political advocacy
democratic theory same book schumpeter expounded theory democracy sought challenge called classical doctrine
disputed idea democracy process electorate identified common good politicians carried out them
argued unrealistic people's ignorance superficiality meant fact largely manipulated politicians set agenda
made 'rule people' concept both unlikely undesirable
instead advocated minimalist model much influenced max weber whereby democracy mechanism competition leaders much like market structure
although periodic votes general public legitimize governments keep them accountable policy program very much seen their own people participatory role individuals usually severely limited
entrepreneurship schumpeter probably first scholar theorize entrepreneurship field owed much contributions
fundamental theories often referred mark mark ii
first schumpeter argued innovation technological change nation come entrepreneurs wild spirits
coined word unternehmergeist german entrepreneur-spirit asserted
doing new things doing things already being done new way stemmed directly efforts entrepreneurs
mark ii developed schumpeter professor harvard
many social economists popular authors day argued large businesses negative effect standard living ordinary people
contrary prevailing opinion schumpeter argued agents drive innovation economy large companies capital invest research development new products services deliver them customers cheaper thus raising their standard living
seminal works capitalism socialism democracy schumpeter soon go details inquire individual items progress most conspicuous trail leads doors those firms work under conditions comparatively free competition precisely door large concerns--which case agricultural machinery also account much progress competitive sector--and shocking suspicion dawns upon us big business may creating standard life keeping down
mark mark ii arguments considered complementary today
cycles long wave theory schumpeter most influential thinker argue long cycles caused innovation incident
treatise business cycles developed based kondratiev's ideas attributed causes very differently
schumpeter's treatise brought kondratiev's ideas attention english-speaking economists
kondratiev fused important elements schumpeter missed
yet schumpeterian variant long-cycles hypothesis stressing initiating role innovations commands widest attention today
schumpeter's view technological innovation cause both cyclical instability economic growth
fluctuations innovation cause fluctuation investment those cause cycles economic growth
schumpeter sees innovations clustering around certain points time periods refers neighborhoods equilibrium entrepreneurs perceive risk returns warrant innovative commitments
these clusters lead long cycles generating periods acceleration aggregate growth
technological view change needs demonstrate changes rate innovation governs changes rate new investments combined impact innovation clusters takes form fluctuation aggregate output employment
process technological innovation involves extremely complex relations among set key variables inventions innovations diffusion paths investment activities
impact technological innovation aggregate output mediated through succession relationships yet explored systematically context long wave
new inventions typically primitive their performance usually poorer existing technologies cost their production high
production technology may yet exist often case major chemical inventions pharmaceutical inventions
speed inventions transformed innovations diffused depends actual expected trajectory performance improvement cost reduction
innovation schumpeter identified innovation critical dimension economic change
argued economic change revolves around innovation entrepreneurial activities market power
sought prove innovation-originated market power provide better results invisible hand price competition
argues technological innovation often creates temporary monopolies allowing abnormal profits soon competed away rivals imitators
these temporary monopolies necessary provide incentive firms develop new products processes
legacy time after death schumpeter's views most influential among various heterodox economists especially european interested industrial organization evolutionary theory economic development tended other end political spectrum schumpeter also often influenced keynes karl marx thorstein veblen
robert heilbroner schumpeter's most renowned pupils extensively worldly philosophers
journal monthly review john bellamy foster journal's founder paul sweezy leading marxist economists united states graduate assistant schumpeter's harvard schumpeter played formative role development thinker
other outstanding students schumpeter's include economists nicholas georgescu-roegen hyman minsky former chairman federal reserve alan greenspan
future nobel laureate robert solow student harvard expanded schumpeter's theory
today schumpeter following outside standard textbook economics areas such economic policy management studies industrial policy study innovation
schumpeter probably first scholar develop theories entrepreneurship
instance european union's innovation program main development plan lisbon strategy influenced schumpeter
