geopolitik main article geopolitik haushofer developed geopolitik widely varied sources including writings oswald spengler alexander humboldt karl ritter friedrich ratzel rudolf kjellén halford j
geopolitik contributed nazi foreign policy chiefly strategy justifications lebensraum
theories contributed five ideas german foreign policy interwar period organic state lebensraum autarky pan-regions land power/sea power dichotomy
geostrategy political science both descriptive analytical like political geography adds normative element strategic prescriptions national policy
while haushofer's ideas stem earlier american british geostrategy german geopolitik adopted essentialist outlook toward national interest oversimplifying issues representing itself panacea
new essentialist ideology geopolitik found itself position prey upon post-world war insecurity populace
haushofer's position university munich served platform spread geopolitical ideas magazine articles books
1922 founded institute geopolitics munich proceeded publicize geopolitical ideas
1924 leader german geopolitik school thought haushofer establish zeitschrift für geopolitik monthly devoted geopolitik
ideas reach wider audience publication volk ohne raum hans grimm 1926 popularizing concept lebensraum
haushofer exercised influence both through academic teachings urging students think terms continents emphasizing motion international politics through political activities
while hitler's speeches attract masses haushofer's works served bring remaining intellectuals fold
geopolitik essence consolidation codification older ideas given scientific gloss lebensraum revised colonial imperialism autarky new expression tariff protectionism strategic control key geographic territories exhibiting same thought behind earlier designs suez panama canals
view controlling land same way those choke points control sea pan-regions panideen based upon british empire american monroe doctrine pan-american union hemispheric defense whereby world divided spheres influence
frontiers view barriers peoples being political
borders nor natural placements races ethnicities being fluid determined will needs ethnic/racial groups
key reorientation each dyad focus land-based empire rather naval imperialism
ostensibly based upon geopolitical theory american naval officer alfred thayer mahan british geographer halford j
mackinder german geopolitik adds older german ideas
enunciated most forcefully friedrich ratzel swedish student rudolf kjellén include organic anthropomorphized conception state need self-sufficiency through top-down organization society
root uniquely german geopolitik rests writings karl ritter first developed organic conception state later elaborated upon ratzel accepted hausfhofer
justified lebensraum even cost other nations' existence because conquest biological necessity state's growth
ratzel's writings coincided growth german industrialism after franco-prussian war subsequent search markets brought competition britain
writings served welcome justification imperial expansion
influenced mahan ratzel aspirations german naval reach agreeing sea power self-sustaining profit trade pay merchant marine unlike land power
haushofer exposed ratzel friends haushofer's father teacher economic geography integrate ratzel's ideas division sea land powers theories saying country both overcome conflict
haushofer's geopolitik expands upon ratzel kjellén
while latter two conceive geopolitik state organism space put service leader haushofer's munich school specifically studies geography relates war designs empire
behavioral rules previous geopoliticians thus turned dynamic normative doctrines action lebensraum world power
haushofer defined geopolitik 1935 duty safeguard right soil land widest sense land within frontiers reich right extensive volk cultural lands
culture itself seen most conducive element dynamic special expansion
provided guide best areas expansion make expansion safe whereas projected military commercial power
haushofer even held urbanization symptom nation's decline evidencing decreasing soil mastery birthrate effectiveness centralized rule
haushofer existence state depended living space pursuit must serve basis policies
germany high population density whereas old colonial powers much lower density virtual mandate german expansion resource-rich areas
space seen military protection against initial assaults hostile neighbors long-range weaponry
buffer zone territories insignificant states one's borders serve protect germany
closely linked need haushofer's assertion existence small states evidence political regression disorder international system
small states surrounding germany ought brought vital german order
these states seen being too small maintain practical autonomy even maintained large colonial possessions better served protection organization within germany
europe saw belgium netherlands portugal denmark switzerland greece mutilated alliance austro-hungary supporting assertion
haushofer's version autarky based quasi-malthusian idea earth become saturated people no longer able provide food
there essentially no increases productivity
haushofer munich school geopolitik eventually expand their conception lebensraum autarky well past borders 1914 place sun new european order then new afro-european order eventually eurasian order
concept became known pan-region taken american monroe doctrine idea national continental self-sufficiency
forward-looking refashioning drive colonies something geopoliticians see economic necessity matter prestige putting pressure older colonial powers
fundamental motivating force economic cultural spiritual
haushofer called today proponent eurasianism advocating policy german–russian hegemony alliance offset anglo-american power structure's potentially dominating influence europe
beyond being economic concept pan-regions strategic concept well
haushofer acknowledges strategic concept heartland put forward british geopolitician halford mackinder

allying italy japan further augment german strategic control eurasia those states becoming naval arms protecting germany's insular position

while hess hitler imprisoned after munich beer hall putsch 1923 haushofer spent six hours visiting two bringing along copy friedrich ratzel's political geography clausewitz's war
after world war ii haushofer deny taught hitler claimed national socialist party perverted hess's study geopolitik
hitler's biographers disagree somewhat extent haushofer's influence hitler ian kershaw writes [his] influence probably greater munich professor later prepared acknowledge while joachim c
fest says hitler's version [haushofer's] ideas distinctly own
haushofer himself viewed hitler half-educated man never correctly understood principles geopolitik passed onto hess foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop principal distorter geopolitik hitler's mind
although haushofer accompanied hess numerous propaganda missions participated consultations nazis japanese leaders claimed hitler nazis seized upon half-developed ideas catchwords
furthermore nazi party government lacked any official organ receptive geopolitik leading selective adoption poor interpretation haushofer's theories
ultimately hess konstantin von neurath nazi minister foreign affairs officials haushofer admit proper understanding geopolitik
father edmund
walsh professor geopolitics dean georgetown university interviewed haushofer after allied victory preparation nuremberg trials disagreed haushofer's assessment geopolitik terribly distorted hitler nazis
cites hitler's speeches declaring small states no right exist nazi use haushofer's maps language arguments
even distorted somewhat walsh felt enough implicate haushofer's geopolitik
haushofer also denied assisting hitler writing mein kampf saying knew once print never read
walsh found even haushofer directly assist hitler discernible new elements appeared mein kampf compared previous speeches made hitler
geopolitical ideas lebensraum space depth defense appeals natural frontiers balancing land seapower geographic analysis military strategy entered hitler's thought imprisonment publishing mein kampf
chapter german policy eastern europe particular displays influence materials haushofer brought hitler hess while imprisoned
haushofer never member nazi party voice disagreements party leading brief imprisonment
haushofer came under suspicion because contacts left wing socialist figures within nazi movement led gregor strasser advocacy essentially german–russian alliance
nazi left wing connections communist party germany leaders especially those influenced national bolshevist philosophy german–russian revolutionary alliance advocated ernst niekisch julius evola ernst jünger hielscher other figures conservative revolution
profess loyalty führer make anti-semitic remarks occasion
however emphasis space over race believing environmental rather racial determinism
refused associate himself anti-semitism policy especially because wife half-jewish
haushofer admits after 1933 much distorted under duress wife protected hess's influence managed her awarded 'honorary german' status son implicated july 20 plot assassinate hitler executed gestapo himself imprisoned dachau concentration camp eight months son grandson imprisoned two-and-a-half months
