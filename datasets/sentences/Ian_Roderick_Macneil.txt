major milestones macneil's development relational essential contract theory described below
'whither contracts?' version paper given macneil annual meeting association american law schools 1967 1968 annual meeting aals being time held shortly after christmas
conference rather overshadowed grant gilmore's contribution same session
gilmore then promoting view there no such thing 'contracts' paper provided radically opposing view
gilmore believed subsuming contracts torts
others time took highly atomised approach macneil describes there such thing contracts? my friends teaching such courses contracts 201 sales contracts 202 negotiable instruments contracts 307 creditors' rights contracts 312 labor law contracts 313 corporations contracts 319 trade regulation delight telling me there no such thing contracts
there say sales contracts negotiable instruments real estate transactions
host other contract-types contracts-in-gross there ain't
[a] personal vested economic interest existence contracts-in-gross caused me search further
since you too share vested interest you will pleased know reached conclusion contracts exists
303 338–339 sense foundation stone macneil's relational contract theory view contracts need neither subsumed torts nor viewed atomised manner
another key aspect theory belief essential bankruptcy conventional contract theory becomes apparent later writings particularly many futures
'whither contracts?' also introduces other fundamental elements relational contract theory
first there no overarching law contracts governs contracts
secondly study study 'contracts' phenomenon contracting
thirdly there foreshadowing tendency widen scope contract cover previously unprecedented range human activity
'restatement second contracts presentiation' first articles macneil himself refers new social contract often regarded real debut relational contract
macneil introduces readers obscure dictionary word 'presentiation'
suggests presentiation useful concept examining point article calls 'traditional' contract systems because these systems says
among greatest intellectual expressions presentiation'
589 590–591 goes say '[s]ince before recorded history developing notion certain kinds manifestations assent promises used reduce future choice enable us presentiate
'592 basis consideration restatement 'primarily founded' upon concept mutual assent points out '[w]hen conclude
mutual assent future exchange
then future bound presentiation accomplished'
despite macneil's dissatisfaction 'transactional' 'conventional' contract law states belief importance presentiation nonetheless ability act now basis something know will come being until future most productive human tools
mutual assent contracting most important ways exercise ability
592 also states here conventional contract law designed facilitate just activity primarily through manipulations notion consent traditional contract theory created legal structure theory attempted presentiate just part relation contracting parties virtually
macneil further argues even objective consent turned out too vague concept achieve goal total presentiation through principle mutual assent fit test objective consent cast out scheme contract altogether relegated quasi-contract tort
macneil's analysis conventional 'total presentiation' approach summarised terms two main characteristics first much possible content
forced pattern mutual assent expressed instantaneous point time
'593 secondly content needed presentiation cannot fitted thus provided eo instante legal system predictably possible
593–594 macneil gives epitome discrete transaction case two men approaching town opposite directions each intending pass through
foot other mounted
meet town after negotiation sale horse agreed price $10 sale completed sunset
little nothing remains dealt everything presentiated
here appears accept possibility truly discrete transactions 'a high degree presentiation possible truly discrete transactions
'594 though case throughout literature transactions generally fully discrete
introduces crucial point macneil's case
under heading 'relational contracts presentiation' says few economic exchanges occur entirely discrete transactional pattern
virtually economic exchange takes place circumstances characterised following relations significant duration example franchising
close whole person relations form integral aspect relation employment
object exchange typically includes both easily measured quantities wages quantities easily measured projection personality airline stewardess
many individuals individual collective poles interest involved relation industrial relations
future cooperative behaviour anticipated players management oakland raiders
benefits burdens relation shared rather divided allocated law partnership
bindingness relation limited again law partnership theory each member free quit almost will
entangling strings friendship reputation interdependence morality altruistic desires integral parts relation theatrical agent clients
trouble expected matter course collective bargaining agreement
finally participants never intend expect see whole future relation presentiated any single time view relation ongoing integration behaviour will grow vary events largely foreseeable future marriage family business
595 macneil goes remainder article look other ways restatement deals challenge posed contracts falling outside transactional paradigm
particular points illustrations produce inconsistent results contrasting conveyancing collective bargaining instance600 cites employment contract illustrations
601 3
'the many futures contracts' second article macneil relational contract published same year
probably along monograph new social contract macneil's best-known most oft-cited work relational theory
major premise article prevalence today relation against transaction
691 694 article after definition contract see below begins definition 'transaction' 'a transaction event sensibly viewable separately other events accompanying temporally engaging small segments total personal beings participants
693 macneil then discusses definition contract starts reproducing definition contract restatement 'a contract promise set promises breach law gives remedy performance law way recognises duty'
then criticises definition following terms
future contract under restatement definition promise manifestation intention act refrain acting specified way law
long unsuccessful struggle reconcile pure simple concept seems me real life contractual behaviour led essay
part article then devoted macneil calls 'primal roots contract' beginning 'specialisation exchange' argument seems specialisation take place there exchange doubtful thesis reference animal kingdom macneil prays aid section though relation argument supports idea village potter will continue make pots unless someone willing provide instance food
698–699 point specialisation exchange may organically determined case communities ants
second 'primal root' there should 'sense choice'
macneil puts 'the concept freedom elect among range behaviours four primal roots contract
'701 '[i]t
unimportant practical impact concept human behaviour determine how much any exercise conscious choice real distinguished being acted upon real
'702 indeed goes further arguing coercive situations should included contract
argument encompasses two categories
first category covers general idea coercive situations second category might termed customary situations
far first category concerned macneil argues703 f while useful include extreme coercive situations contract e
armed 'hold-up' 'inutile' draw clear line spectrum coercive non-coercive indicating point change realms non-contract contract safely excluded altogether 'complete physiological determinism'
going writes moreover turning discrete transactions ongoing relations find even stronger reasons including within scope term 'contract' extremes social coercion
even slave labour camps tend leave room exercise choice allocation time effort
703–704 footnote704 takes logical conclusion claiming applies even camps purpose much labour extermination
macneil's argument here contracts involve pressure arising inequalities bargaining power knowledge et cetera since pressure actually potentially present considerable virtue resides including pressure situations within realm contract even pressure great overwhelms distorts other elements
far second category
customary situations concerned macneil does actually explain here why wishes include type situation justifies including pressure situations generally bring communal kinship situations says involve least 'internalised' coercion
705 aware possible criticism brings too much contract macneil's answer 'many futures' while may trouble integrating such patterns our notions contract plain often exist side side integrated highly choice-oriented patterns clearly contractual nature
moreover exclude such coercive patterns scope contract modern corporate employment involving pensions vesting until 20 30 years employment occurred? clearly slavery arabian satrapy contractual relationship contract work american corporation
nor adhesion contract goods sold high-pressured [sic
door-to-door salesman ghetto contractual contract sell used car consumer another
significant contractual elements
twisted 18-inch specimens near final tree line usefully called trees just their straight 150-foot cousins lower slope too twisted little specimens contract
macneil's third primal root contract 'conscious awareness past present future
'706–710 fourth section discussion primal roots contract macneil calls 'the social matrix'
710 ff means promises and/or contracts sort social background against made there needs language order promises made another
macneil's next section projecting exchange devoted idea contract projecting exchange future particularly idea well promissory exchange-projectors contract there non-promissory ones too
indeed argument while promise powerful exchange-projector nor necessarily most effective giving instances alternatives '[c]ommand status social role kinship bureaucratic patterns religious obligation [and] habit
715 probably most important non-promissory exchange-projectors our expectations exchange now will due dependence ongoing relations cause future exchange occur least partially predictable patterns
macneil puts
very existence people their predictable wants supplies projection exchange future needed justify expenditure effort production
716 argument continues along lines transactional outlook blinded us non-promissory exchange-projectors
most important exchange-projectors most important non-promissory projectors
previous market behaviour will continue
example motor-car manufacturer will able employ staff build factories enter long-term contracts component supply because anyone promised buy single car them because certain pattern demand past makes likely certain level demand future
doing now something affects future necessary both promissory projection non-promissory projection
discussion article non-promissory exchange projectors concludes these words exchange projected future non-promissory techniques does course mean term contract should encompass them well promises
believe however very good reasons exist such definition
719–720 macneil goes discuss choice742–743 begins apparent acceptance idea high levels choice tend accompany highly transactional behaviour while limited choice collectivist conditions behaviour likely relational before going refute idea claiming our status role large extent makes our choices us choose our own status cites rehbinder support following quotation there freedom modern law choose statuses status no longer hierarchic hereditary contrary old status law modern law endeavours reduce economic pressure thereby promote social mobility
contract law burdened man forcing create himself legal position law roles now allows choose among positions behavioural standards created safeguarded state
conclusion cannot accurately predict scope choice degree propinquity any given socio-economic organisation other poles relational transactional free-market centrally planned
bulk article taken up part iii c discussion number transactional/relational axes macneil first sets out summary shape table
738–740 macneil proposes twelve axes extremely transactional pole extremely relational other illustrate contrasts contract transactions contract relations overall relationship type 2 measurability actual measurement 3 basic sources socio-economic support 4 duration 5 commencement termination 6 planning 7 degree future coöperation required post-commencement planning performance incidence benefits burdens 9 obligations undertaken 10 transferability number participants 12 participant views
particular significance planning axis because contract planning central theme macneil's writings case made relational contract theory possible usefulness contract planning
according macneil planning transaction follows fixed pattern
first mutual planning done before commencement contract
secondly primary focus planning definition subject contract exchanged
thirdly while process planning may take place directed how disputes other difficulties should dealt rather process performance
fourthly transaction likely involve goods adhesion planning unilateral there thus likely less mutual planning total
fifthly presumably mutual planning transactions essentially conflict-laden question inevitably ends up 'how much?'
price side quantity quality timeliness etc
goods other
planning relation quite different
firstly future mutual planning expected initial planning taking place say expected planning relationship will take place after performance begun
secondly while substance may primary focus planning relation transaction because human tendency 'transactionise' deal readily available information there will process planning dispute resolution trouble-shooting also performance
relational planning will involve detailed specificity elements regarded essentially transactional process planning will probably very detailed too these specifics seen end planning nor necessarily immutable themselves762 any event
planning relations involves element tentativeness inherent limitation degree specificity completeness possible desirable'
763 thirdly there likely far mutual planning
instance might having goods made order buyer involved extent design process
fourthly while there might called 'relations adhesion' typically new entrant joins existing relation adhesion made reasonable because essential fuzziness context makes possibility modification aspects relation found undesirable entrant
771–772 & 772 n
231 finally while planning transactions inevitably resolved conflict-laden question 'how much?' planning relations need involve conflict because involves separable mix enterprise allocative planning former need conflictual latter may less conflictual transactions because distribution burdens benefits
also macneil's argument here 'pure transaction' any event impossible 'even theory' because relational backdrop transactions provided existence tacit assumptions773 n
235 there will course degree overlap features planning relatively transactional exchanges relatively relational exchanges
also important point relation theory generally frequently missed pure transaction possible contracts relational ones will merely vary point fall axis highly relational very-nearly-a-transaction
means any theory relational contracts must true also most 'transactional' contracts
axis through incidence benefits burdens also worthy note partly because implications contract planning partly implications impossibility wholly transactional contracts
macneil's point transaction entire incidence any particular benefit burden assigned other parties while relations benefits burdens shared
short transactions allocative while relations
implications planning obvious highly relational contract envisaged allocations risks benefits conducive success since transactional nature supposedly antithetical relation
implication theory whole allocative planning found rule rather exception even just very common longer-term complex contractual relations then ought relational exhibits highly transactional features contrary theory leads us expect
'obligations undertaken' content contract such also central planning consists process planning content planning
macneil sub-divided discussion three 'sources content' 'sources obligation' 'specificity obligation sanction'
sum states transactions source communicated express agreement parties sources obligation wholly external specificity high
relations other hand least obligational content develops through relation itself may never made express bindingness arises sources internal parties well external sources specificity likely very low non-existent
further denying existence true transactions macneil argues first section since bindingness external parties part content obligation
bindingness expressly agreed parties transactional norm impossible fulfilment
article macneil first sets out contract norms five them any rate reciprocity 2 rôle effectuation 3 limited freedom exercise choice 4 effectuation planning 5 harmonising social matrix
809 'postscript' macneil writes article
intended initial effort conceptualizing contract behavior interplay transaction relation
806 proposes once recognised most contracts actually relational once five contract norms accepted will possible build unified law contract
single general theory contracts covers contracts equally well opposed present state affairs specific contracts their own special rules general theory primarily covers novel contract situations
'contracts adjustment long-term economic relations under classical neoclassical relational contract law' article macneil gives famous example gasoline purchase
station new jersey turnpike someone rarely traveling road
854 857 further argues discreteness lost even simple promise situation because basis trust must exist promise any value
trust turn presupposes kind relation parties
whether created shared morality prior experience availability legal sanction whatever trust depends upon kind mutual relation transaction integrated
integration relation antithesis discreteness
858 according macneil even gasoline purchase 'quite discrete'857 because there something shared morality does simply steal petrol understanding $10 banknote acceptable exchange item gasoline because prior experience shown useful elsewhere too
other words cannot truly discrete transaction because occurrence transaction must necessarily within social matrix
discussion here turns argumentfrom 859 system discrete transactions flexibility planned outside confines transaction
example macneil gives nineteenth century stove manufacturer requires cast-iron stove parts quantities likely vary because limited information likely demand
according macneil required flexibility achieved pattern discrete transactions keeping each iron purchase contract small amount thereby permitting adjustment quantity up down each time contract entered
thus needed flexibility comes opportunity enter refrain entering market iron
market external transaction rather within
859 concluding paragraph section macneil summarises argument following manner
discrete transaction system resolving conflict need stability need flexibility does shift risks parties largely left fall suppliers goods services
such extent risks shifted shifted totally there no sharing risks
planning risk minimisation thus part internal planning firm rather any mutual planning process
concludes here asserting
there will no planning dealing conflicts possible conflicts through cooperative risk sharing iron manufacturer stove manufacturer
861 footnote dismisses objection professor oliver e
williamson effect ignored effect risk distribution inventory-holding market intermediaries
next subsection article discusses again idea classical contract 'transactional' norms
point macneil's argument here
classical contract law very closely parallels
discrete transactional patterns
[which system]
constitutes stereotype interfirm
contracting laissez faire era
865 final section titled 'relational contract law'
macneil's own words concluding section paper will deal consequences slipping bounds classical contract system altogether reducing discreteness presentiation dominant roles roles equal often subordinate relational norms such preserving relation harmonisation aspects relation whether discrete relational
886 section proper begins emphasising need contract law system enhance discreteness presentiation even concession form neoclassical contract law likely continue exist serve these goals
does however approve such system will
continue rub unnecessarily abrasive manner against realities coexistence relational needs flexibility change
parts contract law system implementing discreteness presentiation perceived
independent system integral parts much larger systems will unnecessary abrasion disappear
888 goes say such abrasion will disappear even does happen
abrasion will disappear however namely resulting
assumption contractual relation encompassed original assent
moreover eliminating abrasion also eliminate
penultimate classical characteristic justifying calling contract law system neoclassical
889 macneil here offers might initial definition relational contract law
replaces neoclassical system
remains classical contract law discreteness presentiation-enhancing segments far larger systems
often playing roles subordinate countless other goals
followed shortly statement
no such system yet exists american law
macneil then turns focus dispute resolution illustrate contrast conventional contract relational contract quotes891 model litigation rights arbitration process obtains conventional contract chayes' article 'the role judge public law litigation'
there five elements model put briefly litigation organised contest two unitary interests 2 controversy concerns identified set completed events 3 scope relief derived substantive violation 4 litigation self-contained episode
impact judgment confined parties entry judgment ends court's involvement 5 process party-initiated party-controlled
macneil comments '[n]aturally no such model will relation supposed continue spite dispute main goal must successful carrying after dispute resolved otherwise eliminated avoided
macneil then proceeds discussion regarding existence hierarchies conventional contract formal communication over informal linguistic over non-linguistic communications communicated circumstances over uncommunicated ones
'adjustment' 893 according macneil these both continue relational contract
rôle sense reflect relative importance placed upon them parties puts writing considered particularly important binding communicates circumstances seem significant will generally leave uncommunicated those relatively trivial
continue sense hierarchies much mutable conditional
macneil suggests though formal written parts contractual relations though care looked constitutional instruments though become moribund case treat them way 'dysfunctional' neoclassical
894 changes expectations will occurred either gradually accretion else suddenly command within accepted acceptable limits relation895 ff these must given effect 'harmonise conflict within internal matrix relation'
895 occurs since relations expected endure indefinitely e
harvard university899 termination treated similarly other change except presumably application norm maintaining relation
sum adjustments including termination expected messy rather following classical pattern sharp-in sharp-out
900 macneil finishes article summary
system based classical paradigm discrete transaction argues depends flexibility market outside transaction itself rather internal factors
relational system allows planning flexibility change
eventually relations become longer complex conventional contract breaks down fully relational system needed very different adjustment processes
new social contract new social contract based macneil's 1979 rosenthal lectures northwestern university together 'many futures' macneil's best-known work relational contract
arguments conventional contract theory being based unrealistic paradigm restated beginning book particular argument there no such thing truly discrete transaction
macneil then goes set out detail text version connected prose table appears both many futures adjustment contrasting discrete transaction contract relation
much remainder first chapter sets out deal essentially how model primitive contractual relation adapted describe modern contractual relation
approached under eight headings measurement specificity 2 sources contractual solidarity 3 planning 4 sharing dividing benefits 5 obligations 6 transferability 7 attitudes power hierarchy command
there higher degree measurement present largely because existence cash side bargain want better word
21–22 'contractual solidarity' achieved both cases through internal relations interdependence custom case modern relation these will significant legalistic element precision
23–24 there will also greater sense separation relation outside modern relation
appears chapters two three relational contract theory depends actually consists number norms
macneil states norms norms positivist sense
37 justifies pointing out definition norm 'pattern trait taken typical behaviour social group' quoting webster's seventh new collegiate dictionary
37–38 first set norms common contracts nine number rôle integrity 2 mutuality 3 implementation planning 4 effectuation consent 5 flexibility 6 contractual solidarity 7 'the linking norms restitution reliance expectation interests' creation restraint power 9 harmonisation social matrix
40 remainder second chapter devoted consideration those norms special special significance conventional relational contract respectively
case conventional contract there 'the discrete norm' macneil calls 'enhancing discreteness presentiation'
60 case relational contract four number61 perhaps belongs common norms rôle integrity specially enhanced relations three new ones specific relational contract 'preservation relation' 'harmonisation relational conflict' 'supracontract norms'
relational norms those specially intensified contractual relations opposed transactions
four number rôle integrity 2 preservation relation 3 harmonisation relational conflict 4 supracontract norms
last three these new sense previously mentioned these names
macneil explains however 'preservation relation' intensification expansion norm contractual solidarity
66 norm involves preservation particular memberships relations individual preservation well preservation larger relation collective preservation
next 'harmonisation relational conflict' course linked relationship preservation macneil treats separately because particular problems perceives arising modern contract relations particular problem harmonising presentiated measured aspects remainder relation
problems also arise terms internal versus external relations within/of relation
69 supracontract norms those factors contractual relations particularly contractual nature example factors arising large contractual relations forming 'minisocieties ministates'
70 chapter three titled 'relational contract law' wide-ranging discussion bases consequences adoption relational contract theory
number points canvassed including role discreteness presentiation contract relations important relegated conflicting norm relationship preservation argument live world agents without principals
macneil also discusses involvement state promoting relational norms both externally
inflicting changes power balance private contracting parties internally through bureaucracy since state itself perceived giant though biggest contractual relation
scheme chapter series discussions turn role discreteness presentiation contractual relations importance 'constituencies' those conducting contractual relations mutuality power contractual solidarity notion disproportionate harm 'purpose planning power perfectionism'
there also discussion notion agency
macneil explains contracts large made directly principals rather via agents shopper principal buys supermarket agent servant-assistant firm's buyer agent buys another firm's salesman another agent/servant
principals? buyer salesmen
their line managers either
nor their respective chief executives
nor boards directors
ultimately each case company question
company isn't real person how know interests secure them? agents even try act company's interests? point very important macneil contract becomes much complex 'relational' those engaging contracting activity essentially acting 'constituencies' fellow employees shareholders customers government
relation fairness bargaining macneil notes feature discrete transactional law acceptance given power status quo before exchange
indeed no mechanisms dealing subject lying does outside discrete transaction
[u]nbalanced power before contract [is irrelevant]
discrete transactional law
85 referring here made clear quotation lord devlin see patrick devlin baron devlin common lawyers hardly recognised principle fair dealing needed independent support
them free dealing fair dealing
long fraud deceit kept out ring up each party fight best bargain get fair fight meant fair bargain result
mutuality then classical contract law least something positive law concerned except insofar courts will decline enforce fraudulently obtained bargains
macneil though concedes 'neoclassical' contract law does concern itself mutuality power status quo prior making bargain then infant doctrine economic duress equitable doctrine undue influence
85 macneil defines solidarity no norm holding exchanges together
90 macneil's analysis solidarity takes durkheim's division 'organic' 'mechanical' solidarity
briefly mechanical solidarity exists likes organic solidarity unalike
latter product among humans specialisation labour macneil's primal roots contract therefore organic solidarity macneil concerned
argued elsewhere solidarity may produce identity selfish interest party acts decrease utility other then own utility decreases too resulting need co-operation
campbell comments '[t]his co-operative attitude makes notion individual utility maximiser inappropriate [relational contracts]'
however arguable individual utility maximiser simply becomes long-run individual utility maximiser
short-term advantage sacrificed gain greater long-run advantage thus maximising utility individual
people co-operate sake increase their own utility
manifestation self-interest may obvious particular course conduct does macneil make absent
put two self-interested participants cohesive relation
see happens self-interest
interest such circumstances cannot afford luxury inconstancy
96–97 macneil observes law provides general stability also directly facilitates solidarity two ways
first provides accomplishment cooperation93 through very existence feel able work others because think likely will ever sue them because fact means our co-operation likely reciprocated
second law's provision relatively precise expression
[or 'index']
great underlying diffuse sea custom social practices human affairs conducted
94 'index' identifies customs et cetera most important thus helping us maintain our sense solidarity including case contract law such ideas obligation pay bills
thus law general contract law particular provides base promotes solidarity
rest discussion focuses social psychological roots organic solidarity technological society macneil comments
[t]his book titled new social contract metaphor modern contractual relations thus distinguishing term social contract term normally used since rousseau
last wish see resurrection theories social contract plain enough me far precluding very sizeable common conscience division labour utterly dependent such social consensus generates
upon edifice common morality built durkheim called restitutive law elements include uniform commercial code securities act even law contract
101 macneil argues sense law contract support solidarity because result need solidarity division labour essential condition development contract creates
contractual solidarity thus norm contract law
concept disproportionate harm part comes under consideration discussion solidarity positive law fails prevent infliction disproportionate harm then solidary feeling tends lessen break down altogether
example macneil gives trade unions britain inflicting considerable harm public obtain quite modest gains seems mind public-sector strikes 1978–9 'winter discontent'
final section 'purpose planning power perfectionism' provides insight attitudes behind macneil's contract thinking
macneil gives here account own utopia land 'post-technique'
112 ff inhabitants abandoned idea 'the best way' favour having good ways doing things less planning
their production perhaps bit lower possibly significantly since discovered elaborate planning today time-consuming unproductive114 well being somewhat hit-and-miss
114–115 minimise planning power bureaucratisation go best way must avoided altogether
competition limited heavy taxes used discourage new technology instance
113 rest law post-technique relational constitution post-technique requires much durkheim calls restitutive law help decentralised centrs keep peace among themselves co-operate affirmatively
since post-techniquans keen formal bureaucratic structures wherever possible law tends conciliatory nature rather like customary law primitive societies
relatively high levels presentiation discreteness advanced technology post-technique require good bit law implementing these norms
occasionally results efforts perfect restitutive law far precise rules commensurate spirit post-technique
these thus far resisted favour statements rather broad principles such those restitution reliance expectations administered through negotiation conciliation arbitration rather through discrete judicial processes
116 reception symposium relational contract theory held northwestern university 1999 papers given number very distinguished american contract scholars including stewart macaulay melvin eisenberg jay feinman eric posner robert e
scott richard speidel
macneil's work often considered inaccessible difficult read
macneil himself expressed disappointment reception work among legal scholars 'i now over decade accept there never any race relational theory contract nor succeeding years seen either widespread acceptance indeed much challenge my particular theory development other relational theories
however northwestern symposium other recent work goes way correcting omission
particular david campbell published edited collection macneil's relational contract theory work
macneil's work particular also discussed richard austen-baker relates macneil's system norms english contract law doctrine used macneil's theory discuss need otherwise further regulation consumer contracts
relational contract theory probably wider use acceptance management scholarship there considerable volume management scholarly literature refers uses macneil's insights
