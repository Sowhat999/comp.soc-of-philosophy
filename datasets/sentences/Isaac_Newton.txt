extraordinary genius proficiency these things
newton later became involved dispute leibniz over priority development calculus leibniz–newton calculus controversy
most modern historians believe newton leibniz developed calculus independently although very different notations
occasionally suggested newton published almost nothing until 1693 give full account until 1704 while leibniz began publishing full account methods 1684
leibniz's notation differential method nowadays recognised much convenient notations adopted continental european mathematicians after 1820 also british mathematicians
such suggestion however fails notice content calculus critics newton's time modern times pointed out book newton's principia itself published 1687 forerunner manuscripts such de motu corporum gyrum motion bodies orbit 1684
principia written language calculus either know newton's later 'dot' notation write
work extensively uses calculus geometric form based limiting values ratios vanishing small quantities principia itself newton gave demonstration under name 'the method first last ratios' explained why put expositions form remarking also 'hereby same thing performed method indivisibles'
because principia called book dense theory application infinitesimal calculus modern times lequel est presque tout de ce calcul 'nearly calculus' newton's time
use methods involving orders infinitesimally small present de motu corporum gyrum 1684 papers motion during two decades preceding 1684
newton reluctant publish calculus because feared controversy criticism
close swiss mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier
1691 duillier started write new version newton's principia corresponded leibniz
1693 relationship duillier newton deteriorated book never completed
starting 1699 other members royal society newton member accused leibniz plagiarism
dispute then broke out full force 1711 royal society proclaimed study newton true discoverer labelled leibniz fraud
study cast doubt later found newton himself study's concluding remarks leibniz
thus began bitter controversy marred lives both newton leibniz until latter's death 1716
newton generally credited generalised binomial theorem valid any exponent
discovered newton's identities newton's method classified cubic plane curves polynomials degree three two variables made substantial contributions theory finite differences first use fractional indices employ coordinate geometry derive solutions diophantine equations

during time any fellow college cambridge oxford required take holy orders become ordained anglican priest
however terms lucasian professorship required holder active church presumably time science
newton argued should exempt ordination requirement charles ii whose permission needed accepted argument
thus conflict newton's religious views anglican orthodoxy averted
optics 1666 newton observed spectrum colours exiting prism position minimum deviation oblong even light ray entering prism circular say prism refracts different colours different angles
led conclude colour property intrinsic light—a point debated prior years
replica newton's second reflecting telescope presented royal society 1672 1670 1672 newton lectured optics
during period investigated refraction light demonstrating multicoloured spectrum produced prism recomposed white light lens second prism
modern scholarship revealed newton's analysis resynthesis white light owes debt corpuscular alchemy
also showed coloured light does change properties separating out coloured beam shining various objects
newton noted regardless whether reflected scattered transmitted remained same colour
thus observed colour result objects interacting already-coloured light rather objects generating colour themselves
known newton's theory colour
illustration dispersive prism decomposing white light colours spectrum discovered newton work concluded lens any refracting telescope suffer dispersion light colours chromatic aberration
proof concept constructed telescope using reflective mirrors instead lenses objective bypass problem
building design first known functional reflecting telescope today known newtonian telescope involved solving problem suitable mirror material shaping technique
newton ground own mirrors out custom composition highly reflective speculum metal using newton's rings judge quality optics telescopes

eight inches long gave clearer larger image
1671 royal society asked demonstration reflecting telescope
their interest encouraged publish notes colours later expanded work opticks

1704 newton published opticks expounded corpuscular theory light
considered light made up extremely subtle corpuscles ordinary matter made grosser corpuscles speculated through kind alchemical transmutation gross bodies light convertible another
may bodies receive much their activity particles light enter their composition? newton also constructed primitive form frictional electrostatic generator using glass globe
article entitled newton prisms 'opticks' tunable lasers indicated newton book opticks first show diagram using prism beam expander
same book describes via diagrams use multiple-prism arrays
278 years after newton's discussion multiple-prism beam expanders became central development narrow-linewidth tunable lasers
also use these prismatic beam expanders led multiple-prism dispersion theory
subsequent newton much amended

work newton stated three universal laws motion
together these laws describe relationship any object forces acting upon resulting motion laying foundation classical mechanics
contributed many advances during industrial revolution soon followed improved upon 200 years
many these advancements continue underpinnings non-relativistic technologies modern world

newton made clear heliocentric view solar system—developed somewhat modern way because already mid-1680 s recognised deviation sun centre gravity solar system
newton precisely centre sun any other body considered rest rather common centre gravity earth sun planets esteem'd centre world centre gravity either rest moves uniformly forward right line newton adopted rest alternative view common consent centre wherever rest
newton's postulate invisible force able act over vast distances led being criticised introducing occult agencies science
later second edition principia 1713 newton firmly rejected such criticisms concluding general scholium writing enough phenomena implied gravitational attraction far indicate cause both unnecessary improper frame hypotheses things implied phenomena
here newton used became famous expression hypotheses non-fingo
principia newton became internationally recognised
acquired circle admirers including swiss-born mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier whom formed intense relationship
abruptly ended 1693 same time newton suffered nervous breakdown
classification cubics beyond descartes most important early influence newton mathematician
descartes freed plane curves greek macedonian limitation conic sections newton followed lead classifying cubic curves plane
found 72 78 species cubics
also divided them four types satisfying different equations 1717 stirling probably newton's help proved every cubic these four types
newton also claimed four types obtained plane projection them proved 1731

apple incident reputed descendants newton's apple tree top bottom trinity college cambridge cambridge university botanic garden instituto balseiro library garden newton himself often story inspired formulate theory gravitation watching fall apple tree
although apple story myth arrive theory gravity any single moment acquaintances newton such william stukeley whose manuscript account 1752 made available royal society fact confirm incident though cartoon version apple actually hit newton's head
stukeley recorded memoirs sir isaac newton's life conversation newton kensington 15 april 1726 went garden & drank thea under shade appletrees & my self
amidst other discourse me just same situation formerly notion gravitation came mind
why should apple descend perpendicularly ground thought himself occasion'd fall apple sat contemplative mood
why should go sideways upwards? constantly earths center? assuredly reason earth draws
there must drawing power matter
& sum drawing power matter earth must earths center any side earth
therefore dos apple fall perpendicularly toward center
matter thus draws matter must proportion quantity
therefore apple draws earth well earth draws apple
john conduitt newton's assistant royal mint husband newton's niece also described event newton's life year 1666 retired again cambridge mother lincolnshire
whilst pensively meandering garden came thought power gravity brought apple tree ground limited certain distance earth power must extend much further usually thought
why high moon himself & must influence her motion & perhaps retain her her orbit whereupon fell calculating effect supposition
