work kripke models modal logic systems kripke's contributions philosophy include kripke semantics modal related logics published several essays beginning while still teens
1970 princeton lectures naming necessity published 1972 1980 significantly restructured philosophy language
interpretation wittgenstein
theory truth
also contributed set-theory see admissible ordinal kripke-platek set theory modal logic two kripke's earlier works completeness theorem modal logic semantical considerations modal logic former written while still teenager subject modal logic
most familiar logics modal family constructed weak logic called k named after kripke contributions modal logic
kripke introduced now-standard kripke semantics also known relational semantics frame semantics modal logics
kripke semantics formal semantics non-classical logic systems
first made modal logics later adapted intuitionistic logic other non-classical systems
discovery kripke semantics breakthrough making non-classical logics because model theory such logics absent prior kripke
kripke frame modal frame pair w non-empty set r binary relation w
elements w called nodes worlds r known accessibility relation
depending properties accessibility relation transitivity reflexivity etc
corresponding frame described extension being transitive reflexive etc
kripke model triple kripke frame relation nodes w modal formulas such implies
read w satisfies satisfied w w forces
relation called satisfaction relation evaluation forcing relation
satisfaction relation uniquely determined value propositional variables
formula valid model w ∈ w frame valid possible choices class c frames models valid every member c
define thm c set formulas valid c
conversely x set formulas let mod x class frames validate every formula x
modal logic
set formulas l sound respect class frames c l ⊆ thm c
l complete respect c l ⊇ thm c
semantics useful investigating logic
derivation system semantical entailment relation reflects syntactical counterpart consequence relation derivability
vital know modal logics sound complete respect class kripke frames them determine class
any class c kripke frames thm c normal modal logic particular theorems minimal normal modal logic k valid every kripke model
however converse does hold generally
there kripke incomplete normal modal logics unproblematic because most modal systems studied complete classes frames described simple conditions
normal modal logic l corresponds class frames c c = mod l
other words c largest class frames such l sound wrt c
follows l kripke complete complete corresponding class
consider schema t
t valid any reflexive frame then since w r w
other hand frame validates t reflexive fix w ∈ w define satisfaction propositional variable p follows w r u
then thus t means w r w using definition
t corresponds class reflexive kripke frames
often much easier characterize corresponding class l prove completeness thus correspondence serves guide completeness proofs
correspondence also used show incompleteness modal logics suppose l1 ⊆ l2 normal modal logics correspond same class frames l1 does prove theorems l2
then l1 kripke incomplete
example schema generates incomplete logic corresponds same class frames gl viz
transitive converse well-founded frames does prove gl-tautology
any normal modal logic l kripke model called canonical model constructed validates precisely theorems l adaptation standard technique using maximal consistent sets models
canonical kripke models play role similar lindenbaum–tarski algebra construction algebraic semantics
set formulas l-consistent no contradiction derived them using axioms l modus ponens
maximal l-consistent set l-mcs short l-consistent set no proper l-consistent superset
canonical model l kripke model w set l-mcs relations r follows every formula then
canonical model model l every l-mcs contains theorems l
zorn's lemma each l-consistent set contained l-mcs particular every formula unprovable l counterexample canonical model
main application canonical models completeness proofs
properties canonical model k immediately imply completeness k respect class kripke frames
argument does work arbitrary l because there no guarantee underlying frame canonical model satisfies frame conditions l
say formula set x formulas canonical respect property p kripke frames x valid every frame satisfies p any normal modal logic l contains x underlying frame canonical model l satisfies p
union canonical sets formulas itself canonical
follows preceding discussion any logic axiomatized canonical set formulas kripke complete compact
axioms t 4 5 h g thus any combination them canonical
gl grz canonical because compact
axiom m itself canonical goldblatt combined logic s4
fact even k4
general undecidable whether given axiom canonical
know nice sufficient condition h
sahlqvist identified broad class formulas now called sahlqvist formulas such sahlqvist formula canonical class frames corresponding sahlqvist formula first-order definable there algorithm computes corresponding frame condition given sahlqvist formula
powerful criterion example axioms listed above canonical equivalent sahlqvist formulas
logic finite model property fmp complete respect class finite frames
application notion decidability question follows post's theorem recursively axiomatized modal logic l fmp decidable provided decidable whether given finite frame model l
particular every finitely axiomatizable logic fmp decidable
there various methods establishing fmp given logic
refinements extensions canonical model construction often work using tools such filtration unravelling
another possibility completeness proofs based cut-free sequent calculi usually produce finite models directly
most modal systems used practice including listed above fmp
cases use fmp prove kripke completeness logic every normal modal logic complete wrt class modal algebras finite modal algebra transformed kripke frame
example robert bull proved using method every normal extension s4
3 fmp kripke complete
kripke semantics straightforward generalization logics modality
kripke frame language set necessity operators consists non-empty set w equipped binary relations ri each ∈
definition satisfaction relation modified follows simplified semantics discovered tim carlson often used polymodal provability logics
carlson model structure single accessibility relation r subsets di ⊆ w each modality
satisfaction defined carlson models easier visualize work usual polymodal kripke models there however kripke complete polymodal logics carlson incomplete
semantical considerations modal logic published 1963 kripke responded difficulty classical quantification theory
motivation world-relative approach represent possibility objects world may fail exist another
standard quantifier rules used however every term must refer something exists possible worlds
seems incompatible our ordinary practice using terms refer things exist contingently
kripke's response difficulty eliminate terms
gave example system uses world-relative interpretation preserves classical rules
however costs severe
first language artificially impoverished second rules propositional modal logic must weakened
kripke's possible worlds theory used narratologists beginning pavel dolezel understand reader's manipulation alternative plot developments characters' planned fantasized alternative action series
application become especially useful analysis hyperfiction
intuitionistic logic kripke semantics intuitionistic logic follows same principles semantics modal logic uses different definition satisfaction
intuitionistic kripke model triple partially ordered kripke frame satisfies following conditions p propositional variable then persistency condition implies
intuitionistic logic sound complete respect kripke semantics finite model property
intuitionistic first-order logic let l first-order language
kripke model l triple intuitionistic kripke frame mw classical l-structure each node w ∈ w following compatibility conditions hold whenever u ≤ v domain mu included domain mv realizations function symbols mu mv agree elements mu each n-ary predicate p elements a1
∈ mu pa1
holds mu then holds mv
given evaluation e variables elements mw define satisfaction relation holds mw implies there exists such every every
here ex→a evaluation gives x value otherwise agrees e
naming necessity main article naming necessity cover naming necessity three lectures form naming necessity constitute attack descriptivist theory names
kripke attributes variants descriptivist theories frege russell ludwig wittgenstein john searle among others
according descriptivist theories proper names either synonymous descriptions their reference determined virtue name's being associated description cluster descriptions object uniquely satisfies
kripke rejects both these kinds descriptivism
gives several examples purporting render descriptivism implausible theory how names get their references determined e
surely aristotle died age two satisfied any descriptions associate name yet seem wrong deny aristotle
alternative kripke outlined causal theory reference according name refers object virtue causal connection object mediated through communities speakers
points out proper names contrast most descriptions rigid designators
proper name refers named object every possible world object exists while most descriptions designate different objects different possible worlds
example 'nixon' refers same person every possible world nixon exists while 'the person won united states presidential election 1968' refer nixon humphrey others different possible worlds
kripke also raised prospect posteriori necessities — facts necessarily true though known through empirical investigation
examples include hesperus phosphorus cicero tully water h2 o other identity claims two names refer same object
finally kripke gave argument against identity materialism philosophy mind view every mental particular identical physical particular
kripke argued way defend identity posteriori necessary identity such identity — e
pain c-fibers firing — necessary given clearly conceivable possibility pain separate firing c-fibers firing c-fibers separate pain see philosophical zombie
similar arguments proposed david chalmers
any event psychophysical identity theorist according kripke incurs dialectical obligation explain apparent logical possibility these circumstances opinion such theorists should impossible
kripke delivered john locke lectures philosophy oxford 1973
titled reference existence many respects continuation naming necessity deal subjects fictional names perceptual error
recently published oxford university press
1995 paper philosopher quentin smith argued key concepts kripke's new theory reference originated work ruth barcan marcus decade earlier
smith identified six significant ideas new theory claimed marcus developed idea proper names direct references don't consist contained definitions
2 while single out single thing description description equivalent proper name thing
3 modal argument proper names directly referential disguised descriptions
4 formal modal logic proof necessity identity
5 concept rigid designator though actual name concept coined kripke
6 idea posteriori identity
smith proceeded argue kripke failed understand marcus' theory time yet later adopted many key conceptual themes new theory reference
other scholars subsequently offered detailed responses arguing no plagiarism occurred
puzzle belief kripke's main propositions naming necessity concerning proper names meaning name simply object refers name's referent determined causal link sort baptism utterance name
nevertheless acknowledges possibility propositions containing names may additional semantic properties properties explain why two names referring same person may give different truth values propositions beliefs
example lois lane believes superman fly although she does believe clark kent fly
accounted names superman clark kent though referring same person distinct semantic properties
article puzzle belief kripke seems oppose even possibility
argument reconstructed following way idea two names referring same object may different semantic properties supposed explain coreferring names behave differently propositions beliefs lois lane's case
same phenomenon occurs even coreferring names obviously same semantic properties kripke invites us imagine french monolingual boy pierre believes following londres est joli
london beautiful
pierre moves london without realizing london = londres
then learns english same way child learn language translating words french english
pierre learns name london unattractive part city lives comes believe london beautiful
kripke's account correct pierre now believes both londres joli london beautiful
cannot explained coreferring names having different semantic properties
according kripke demonstrates attributing additional semantic properties names does explain intended
wittgenstein first published 1982 kripke's wittgenstein rules private language contends central argument wittgenstein's philosophical investigations centers devastating rule-following paradox undermines possibility our ever following rules our use language
kripke writes paradox most radical original skeptical problem philosophy seen date
60 kripke argues wittgenstein does reject argument leads rule-following paradox accepts offers 'skeptical solution' ameliorate paradox's destructive effects
whilst most commentators[citation needed] accept philosophical investigations contains rule-following paradox kripke presents few concurred kripke attributes skeptical solution wittgenstein
should noted kripke himself expresses doubts wittgenstein rules private language whether wittgenstein endorse interpretation philosophical investigations
says work should read attempt give accurate statement wittgenstein's views rather account wittgenstein's argument struck kripke presented problem p
portmanteau kripkenstein coined jesting nickname kripke's reading philosophical investigations
real significance kripkenstein put forward clear statement new kind skepticism dubbed meaning skepticism idea isolated individual there no fact virtue he/she means thing rather another use word
kripke's skeptical solution meaning skepticism ground meaning behavior community
kripke's book generated large secondary literature[citation needed] divided those find skeptical problem interesting perceptive others such gordon baker peter hacker argue meaning skepticism pseudo-problem stems confused selective reading wittgenstein
kripke's position however recently defended against these other attacks cambridge philosopher martin kusch 2006 wittgenstein scholar david g
stern considers book most influential widely discussed work wittgenstein since 1980 s
truth main article truth 1975 article outline theory truth kripke showed language consistently contain own truth predicate deemed impossible alfred tarski pioneer area formal theories truth
approach involves letting truth partially defined property over set grammatically well-formed sentences language
kripke showed how recursively starting set expressions language contain truth predicate defining truth predicate over just segment action adds new sentences language truth turn defined them
unlike tarski's approach however kripke's lets truth union these definition-stages after denumerable infinity steps language reaches fixed point such using kripke's method expand truth-predicate does change language any further
such fixed point then taken basic form natural language containing own truth predicate
predicate undefined any sentences speak bottom out simpler sentences containing truth predicate
'snow white' true well-defined snow white true' true forth neither sentence true nor sentence true receive truth-conditions kripke's terms ungrounded
saul kripke gives lecture gödel university california santa barbara
nevertheless shown gödel self-reference cannot avoided naively since propositions seemingly unrelated objects such integers informal self-referential meaning idea - manifested diagonal lemma - basis tarski's theorem truth cannot consistently defined
thus claimed kripke's suggestion does lead contradiction while truth predicate partial does give truth value true/false propositions such built tarski's proof therefore inconsistent
while there still debate whether tarski's proof implemented every variation such partial truth system none shown consistent acceptable proving methods used mathematical logic
kripke's proposal also problematic sense while language contains truth predicate itself least partial sentences - such liar sentence sentence false - undefined truth value language does contain own undefined predicate
fact cannot will create new version liar paradox called strengthened liar paradox sentence false undefined
thus while liar sentence undefined language language cannot express undefined
