jefferson replied immediately cordial letter two men revived their friendship sustained mail
correspondence resumed 1812 lasted rest their lives hailed among their great legacies american literature
their letters represent insight both period minds two revolutionary leaders presidents
missives lasted fourteen years consisted 158 letters–109 adams 49 jefferson
two men discussed natural aristocracy
jefferson natural aristocracy consider most precious gift nature instruction trusts government society
indeed inconsistent creation formed man social state provided virtue wisdom enough manage concerns society
may even say form government best provides most effectually pure selection these natural [aristocrats] offices government? adams wondered ever clear these people your distinction natural artificial aristocracy does appear me well founded
birth wealth conferred men imperiously nature genius strength beauty
aristocracies established human laws honour wealth power made hereditary municipal laws political institutions then acknowledge artificial aristocracy commence
true adams argued fate bestow influence men reasons other true wisdom virtue
being way nature thought such talents natural
good government therefore account reality

less month before death adams issued statement destiny united states historians such joy hakim characterized warning fellow citizens my best wishes joys festivities solemn services day will completed fiftieth year birth independence united states memorable epoch annals human race destined future history form brightest blackest page according use abuse those political institutions shall time come shaped human mind
july 4 1826 fiftieth anniversary adoption declaration independence adams died home quincy approximately 620 pm
jefferson died earlier same day
adams' crypt lies united first parish church quincy massachusetts wife abigail son john quincy adams
adams died last words included acknowledgement longtime friend rival thomas jefferson survives though adams unaware jefferson died several hours before
political philosophy views slavery adams never bought slave declined principle utilize slave labor saying through my whole life held practice slavery such abhorrence never owned negro any other slave though lived many years times practice disgraceful best men my vicinity thought inconsistent their character cost me thousands dollars labor subsistence free men might saved purchase negroes times very cheap
adams generally tried keep issue out national politics because anticipated southern response during time unity needed achieve independence
spoke out 1777 against bill emancipate slaves massachusetts saying issue presently too divisive legislation should sleep time
also against use black soldiers revolution due opposition southerners
slavery abolished massachusetts 1780 forbidden implication declaration rights john adams massachusetts constitution
abigail adams other hand vocally opposed slavery
accusations monarchism throughout lifetime adams expressed controversial shifting views regarding virtues monarchical hereditary political institutions
times conveyed substantial support these approaches suggesting example hereditary monarchy aristocracy institutions possibly preserve laws liberties people
yet other times distanced himself such ideas calling himself mortal irreconcilable enemy monarchy no friend hereditary limited monarchy america
such denials assuage critics adams often accused being monarchist
many these attacks considered scurrilous including suggestions planning crown himself king grooming john quincy heir throne
however peter shaw argued [t]he inevitable attacks adams crude stumbled truth admit himself
leaning toward monarchy aristocracy distinct kings aristocrats time 'davila' though directly reveal essays
decidedly sometime after became vice-president adams concluded united states adopt hereditary legislature monarch
outlined plan state conventions appoint hereditary senators while national appointed president life
contradiction such notions adams asserted letter thomas jefferson you suppose ever design desire attempting introduce government king lords commons other words hereditary executive hereditary senate either government united states any individual state country you wholly mistaken
there such thought expressed intimated any public writing private letter mine may safely challenge mankind produce such passage quote chapter verse
religious views adams raised congregationalist since ancestors puritans
according biographer mc cullough family friends knew adams both devout christian independent thinker
letter benjamin rush adams credited religion success ancestors since their migration new world 1630 s
adams educated harvard influence deism growing there sometimes used deistic terms speeches writing
also believed regular church service beneficial man's moral sense
everett 1966 concludes adams strove religion based common sense sort reasonableness maintained religion must change evolve toward perfection
fielding 1940 argues adams' beliefs synthesized puritan deist humanist concepts
adams point christianity originally revelatory being misinterpreted misused service superstition fraud unscrupulous power
goff 1993 acknowledges fielding's persuasive argument adams never deist because allowed suspension laws nature believed evil internal result external institutions
frazer 2004 notes while adams shared many perspectives deists adams clearly deist
deism rejected any supernatural activity intervention god consequently deists believe miracles god's providence
adams however believe miracles providence certain extent bible revelation
frazer further argues adams' theistic rationalism like other founders sort middle ground protestantism deism
contrast david l
holmes argued adams beginning congregationalist ended days christian unitarian accepting central tenets unitarian creed also accepting jesus redeemer humanity biblical account miracles true
like many protestant contemporaries adams criticized claims universal authority made roman catholic church
1796 adams denounced political opponent thomas paine's deistic criticisms christianity age reason saying christian religion above religions ever prevailed existed ancient modern times religion wisdom virtue equity humanity let blackguard paine say will
