finance capital finanzkapital 1923 hilferding's finance capital das finanzkapital vienna 1910 seminal marxist analysis transformation competitive pluralistic 'liberal capitalism' monopolistic 'finance capital' anticipated lenin's bukharin's largely derivative writings subject
writing context highly cartelized economy late austria-hungary hilferding contrasted monopolistic finance capitalism earlier competitive buccaneering capitalism earlier liberal era
unification industrial mercantile banking interests defused earlier liberal capitalist demands reduction economic role mercantilist state instead finance capital sought centralized privilege-dispensing state
whereas until 1860 s demands capital bourgeoisie hilferding's view constitutional demands affected citizens alike finance capital increasingly sought state intervention behalf wealth-owning classes capitalists rather nobility now dominated state
hilferding saw opportunity path socialism distinct foreseen marx socializing function finance capital facilitates enormously task overcoming capitalism
once finance capital brought most importance branches production under control enough society through conscious executive organ state conquered working class seize finance capital order gain immediate control these branches production
make unnecessary expropriate peasant farms small businesses because indirectly socialized through socialization institutions upon finance capital already made them dependent
thus because narrow class dominated economy socialist revolution gain wider support directly expropriating narrow class
particular according hilferding societies reached level economic maturity anticipated marx making them ripe socialism opened socialist possibilities
furthermore policy finance capital bound lead towards war hence unleashing revolutionary storms
