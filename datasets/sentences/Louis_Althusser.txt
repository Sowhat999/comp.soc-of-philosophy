thought althusser's earlier works include influential volume reading capital 1965 collects work althusser students intensive philosophical rereading karl marx's capital
book reflects philosophical status marxist theory critique political economy object
current english edition work includes essays althusser étienne balibar while original french edition contains additional contributions jacques rancière pierre macherey roger establet
several althusser's theoretical positions remained influential marxist philosophy
introduction collection marx proposes great epistemological break marx's early writings 1840–45 later properly marxist texts borrowing term philosopher science gaston bachelard
essay marxism humanism strong statement anti-humanism marxist theory condemning ideas like human potential species-being often put forth marxists outgrowths bourgeois ideology humanity
essay contradiction overdetermination borrows concept overdetermination psychoanalysis order replace idea contradiction complex model multiple causality political situations idea closely related antonio gramsci's concept cultural hegemony
althusser also widely known theorist ideology
best-known essay ideology ideological state apparatuses notes toward investigation establishes concept ideology
althusser's theory ideology draws marx gramsci also freud's lacan's psychological concepts unconscious mirror-phase respectively describes structures systems enable concept self
these structures althusser both agents repression inevitable impossible escape ideology avoid being subjected
other hand collection essays ideology ideological state apparatuses drawn contains other essays confirm althusser's concept ideology broadly consistent classic marxist theory class struggle
althusser's thought evolved during lifetime
subject argument debate especially within marxism specifically concerning theory knowledge epistemology
epistemological break althusser's contention marx's thought fundamentally misunderstood underestimated
fiercely condemns various interpretations marx's works—historicism idealism economism—on grounds fail realise science history historical materialism marx constructed revolutionary view social change
these errors believes result notion marx's entire body work understood coherent whole
rather althusser holds marx's thought contains radical epistemological break
although works young marx bound categories german philosophy classical political economy german ideology written 1845 makes sudden unprecedented departure
break represents shift marx's work fundamentally different problematic
different set central propositions questions posed different theoretical framework
althusser believes marx himself fully comprehend significance own work able express obliquely tentatively
shift revealed careful sensitive symptomatic reading
thus althusser's project help readers fully grasp originality power marx's extraordinary theory giving much attention explicit
althusser holds marx discovered continent knowledge history analogous contributions thales mathematics galileo physics better freud's psychoanalysis structure theory unlike anything posited predecessors
althusser believes marx's work fundamentally incompatible antecedents because built groundbreaking epistemology theory knowledge rejects distinction subject object
opposition empiricism althusser claims marx's philosophy dialectical materialism counters theory knowledge vision theory knowledge production
empiricist view knowing subject encounters real object uncovers essence means abstraction
assumption thought direct engagement reality unmediated vision real object empiricist believes truth knowledge lies correspondence subject's thought object external thought itself
contrast althusser claims find latent marx's work view knowledge theoretical practice
althusser theoretical practice takes place entirely within realm thought working upon theoretical objects never coming direct contact real object aims know
knowledge discovered rather produced way three generalities raw material pre-scientific ideas abstractions facts 2 conceptual framework problematic brought bear upon these 3 finished product transformed theoretical entity concrete knowledge
view validity knowledge does lie correspondence something external itself because marx's historical materialism science contains own internal methods proof
therefore governed interests society class ideology politics distinct economic superstructure
addition unique epistemology marx's theory built concepts—such forces relations production—that no counterpart classical political economy
even existing terms adopted—for example theory surplus value combines david ricardo's concepts rent profit interest—their meaning relation other concepts theory significantly different
however fundamental marx's break rejection homo economicus idea held classical economists needs individuals treated fact given independent any economic organisation
classical economists individual needs serve premise theory explaining character mode production independent starting point theory society
classical political economy explains economic systems response individual needs marx's analysis accounts wider range social phenomena terms parts play structured whole
consequently marx's capital greater explanatory power does political economy because provides both model economy description structure development whole society
althusser's view marx does simply argue human needs largely created their social environment thus vary time place rather abandons very idea there theory people like prior any theory how come way
although althusser steadfastly holds onto claim existence later asserts turning point's occurrence around 1845 clearly defined traces humanism historicism hegelianism found capital
states marx's critique gotha programme marginal notes book adolph wagner fully free humanist ideology
line althusser replaces earlier definition marx's philosophy theory theoretical practice new belief politics field history class struggle theory
althusser considers epistemological break process instead clearly defined event — product incessant struggle against ideology
distinction ideology science philosophy thus assured once epistemological break
levels practices because marx's belief individual product society althusser holds pointless try build social theory prior conception individual
subject observation individual human elements rather structure
sees marx does explain society appealing properties individual persons—their beliefs desires preferences judgements
rather marx defines society set fixed levels practices
uses analysis defend marx's historical materialism against charge crudely posits base economic level superstructure culture/politics rising upon then attempts explain aspects superstructure appealing features economic base well known architectural metaphor
althusser mistake attribute economic determinist view marx
much same way criticises idea social theory founded historical conception human needs does althusser critique idea economic practice used isolation explain other aspects society
althusser believes both base superstructure interdependent although keeps classic marxist materialist understanding determination base last instance albeit extension revision
advantage levels practices over individuals starting point although each practice part complex whole society practice whole itself consists number different kinds parts
economic practice example contains raw materials tools individual persons etc
united process production
althusser conceives society interconnected collection these wholes economic practice ideological practice politico-legal practice
although each practice degree relative autonomy together make up complex structured whole social formation
view levels practices dependent each other
example amongst relations production capitalist societies buying selling labour power capitalists workers
these relations part economic practice exist within context legal system establishes individual agents buyers sellers furthermore arrangement must maintained political ideological means
seen aspects economic practice depend superstructure vice versa
moment reproduction constituted important role superstructure
contradiction overdetermination analysis understood terms interdependent levels practices helps us conceive how society organised also allows us comprehend social change thus provides theory history
althusser explains reproduction relations production reference aspects ideological political practice conversely emergence new production relations explained failure these mechanisms
marx's theory seems posit system imbalance two parts lead compensatory adjustments other levels sometimes major reorganisation whole
develop idea althusser relies concepts contradiction non-contradiction claims illuminated their relation complex structured whole
practices contradictory grate another non-contradictory support another
althusser elaborates these concepts reference lenin's analysis russian revolution 1917
lenin posited spite widespread discontent throughout europe early 20 th century russia country revolution occurred because contained contradictions possible within single state time
words weakest link chain imperialist states
explained revolution relation two groups circumstances firstly existence within russia large-scale exploitation cities mining districts etc
disparity urban industrialisation medieval conditions countryside lack unity amongst ruling class secondly foreign policy played hands revolutionaries such elites exiled tsar become sophisticated socialists
althusser example reinforces claim marx's explanation social change complex result single contradiction forces relations production
differences events russia western europe highlight contradiction forces relations production may necessary sufficient bring revolution
circumstances produced revolution russia mentioned above heterogeneous cannot seen aspects large contradiction
each contradiction within particular social totality different structural level social practice
althusser concludes marx's concept contradiction inseparable concept complex structured social whole
emphasise changes social structures relate numerous contradictions althusser describes these changes overdetermined using term taken sigmund freud
interpretation allows us account way many different circumstances may play part course events how these circumstances may combine produce unexpected social changes ruptures
however althusser does mean say events determine social changes same causal status
while part complex whole economic practice structure dominance plays major part determining relations other spheres effect them
most prominent aspect society religious aspect feudal formations economic aspect capitalist ones called dominant instance turn determined last instance economy
althusser economic practice society determines other aspect society dominates society whole
althusser's arguably complex materialist other marxisms understanding contradiction terms dialectic attempts rid marxism influence vestiges hegelian idealist dialectics component part general anti-humanist position
ideological state apparatuses main article ideology ideological state apparatuses because althusser held person's desires choices intentions preferences judgements forth products social practices believed necessary conceive how society makes individual own image
within capitalist societies human individual generally regarded subject endowed property being self-conscious responsible agent whose actions explained her beliefs thoughts
althusser however person's capacity perceiving herself way innate given
rather acquired within structure established social practices impose individuals role forme subject
social practices both determine characteristics individual give her idea range properties she limits each individual
althusser argues many our roles activities given us social practice example production steelworkers part economic practice while production lawyers part politico-legal practice
however other characteristics individuals such their beliefs good life their metaphysical reflections nature self easily fit these categories
althusser's view our values desires preferences inculcated us ideological practice sphere defining property constituting individuals subjects
ideological practice consists assortment institutions called ideological state apparatuses isas include family media religious organisations most importantly capitalist societies education system well received ideas propagate
there however no single isa produces us belief self-conscious agents
instead derive belief course learning daughter schoolchild black steelworker councillor forth
despite many institutional forms function structure ideology unchanging present throughout history althusser states ideology no history
ideologies constitute subject even though she may differ according each particular ideology
memorably althusser illustrates concept hailing interpellation
drawing heavily lacan concept mirror stage compares ideology policeman shouting hey you there! toward person walking street
upon hearing call person responds turning around doing transformed subject
person conscious being subject aware other person
thus althusser being aware other people form ideology
within althusser sees subjectivity type ideology
person being hailed recognizes herself subject hail knows respond
althusser calls recognition mis-recognition méconnaissance because works retroactively material individual already ideological subject even before she born
transformation individual subject already happened althusser here acknowledges debt spinoza's theory immanence
highlight althusser offers example christian religious ideology embodied voice god instructing person place world must reconciled christ
althusser draws point order person identify himself christian must first already subject responding god's call following rules affirms himself free agent author acts assumes responsibility
cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology fact our very actions reach out overarching structure
althusser acquire our identities seeing ourselves mirrored ideologies
reception influence although althusser's theories born attempt defend saw communist orthodoxy eclecticism influences—drawing equally contemporary structuralism philosophy science psychoanalysis thinkers marxist tradition—reflected move away intellectual isolation stalin era
furthermore thought symptomatic marxism's growing academic respectability push towards emphasising marx's legacy philosopher rather economist sociologist
tony judt saw criticism althusser's work saying removed marxism altogether realm history politics experience thereby
render[ed] invulnerable any criticism empirical sort
althusser broad influence areas marxist philosophy post-structuralism interpellation popularised adapted feminist philosopher critic judith butler elaborated further göran therborn concept ideological state apparatuses interest slovenian philosopher slavoj žižek attempt view history process without subject garnered sympathy jacques derrida historical materialism defended coherent doctrine standpoint analytic philosophy g
cohen interest structure agency sparked althusser play role anthony giddens's theory structuration althusser vehemently[need quotation verify] attacked british historian e
thompson book poverty theory
[non-primary source needed] althusser's influence also seen work economists richard
wolff stephen resnick interpreted marx's mature works hold conception class different normally understood ones
them marx class refers group people example those own means production versus those process involving production appropriation distribution surplus labor
their emphasis class process consistent their reading use althusser's concept overdetermination terms understanding agents objects site multiple determinations
althusser's work also criticized number angles
1971 paper socialist register polish philosopher leszek kołakowski undertook detailed critique structural marxism arguing concept seriously flawed three main points will argue whole althusser's theory made up following elements
common sense banalities expressed help unnecessarily complicated neologisms 2
traditional marxist concepts vague ambiguous marx himself engels remain after althusser's explanation exactly vague ambiguous before 3
striking historical inexactitudes
kołakowski further argued despite althusser's claims scientific rigour structural marxism unfalsifiable thus unscientific best understood quasi-religious ideology
1980 sociologist axel van den berg described kołakowski's critique devastating proving althusser retains orthodox radical rhetoric simply severing connections verifiable facts
gerald cohen essay 'complete bullshit' cited 'althusserian school' example 'bullshit' factor co-founding 'non-bullshit marxism group'
says 'the ideas althusserians generated example interpellation subject contradiction overdetermination possessed surface allure often seemed impossible determine whether theses those ideas figured true other times those theses seemed capable just two interpretations them true uninteresting other interesting quite obviously false'
legacy since death reassessment althusser's work influence ongoing
