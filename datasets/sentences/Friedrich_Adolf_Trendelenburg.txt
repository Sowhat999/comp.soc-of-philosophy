1865 became involved acrimonious controversy interpretation kant's doctrine space kuno fischer whom attacked kuno fischer und sein kant 1869 drew forth reply anti-trendelenburg 1870
philosophy trendelenburg's philosophizing conditioned throughout loving study plato aristotle whom regards opponents building jointly broad basis idealism
own standpoint may called modern version aristotelianism
while denying possibility absolute method absolute philosophy contended hegel others trendelenburg emphatically idealist ancient platonic sense whole work devoted demonstration ideal real
maintained procedure philosophy must analytic rising particular facts universal find them explained
divine system whole part know process reconstruction must remain approximative
our position forbids possibility final system
instead therefore constantly beginning afresh speculation should our duty attach ourselves may considered permanent results historic developments
classical expression these results trendelenburg finds mainly platonico-aristotelian system
philosophical question stated thus how thought being united knowledge? how does thought get being? how does being enter thought? proceeding principle like known like trendelenburg next reaches doctrine peculiar himself though based upon aristotle plays central part speculations

side stand those acknowledge none efficient causes make force prior thought explain universe tergo [from back]
may called typically democritism
other side stands organic teleological view world interprets parts through idea whole sees efficient causes vehicle ideal ends
may called wide sense platonism
systems like spinozism seem form third class neither sacrificing force thought nor thought force yet their denial final causes inevitably fall back democritic essentially materialistic standpoint leaving us great antagonism mechanical organic systems philosophy
latter view receives first support facts life organic nature such finds culmination ultimate verification ethical world essentially consists realization ends
trendelenburg's naturrecht [the right nature] may therefore taken manner completion system working out ideal present real
ethical end taken idea humanity abstract formulated kant context state history
