max weber's thought max weber's bureaucratic theory model sometimes also known legal-rational model
model tries explain bureaucracy rational point view via nine 9 main characteristics principles these follows max weber's bureaucratic model legal-rational model weber modern bureaucracy both public private sector relies following principles
first based general principle precisely defined organized across-the-board competencies various offices
these competencies underpinned rules laws administrative regulations
weber means rigid division labor established clearly identifies regular tasks duties particular bureaucratic system
there firmly established chains command duties capacity coerce others comply described regulation
regular continuous execution assigned duties undertaken hiring people particular qualifications certified
weber notes these three aspects constitute essence bureaucratic administration
public sector
private sector these three aspects constitute essence bureaucratic management private company
main principles characteristics specialized roles
recruitment based merit e
tested through open competition
uniform principles placement promotion transfer administrative system
careerism systematic salary structure
hierarchy responsibility accountability
subjection official conduct strict rules discipline control
supremacy abstract rules
impersonal authority
office bearer does bring office
political neutrality
merits max weber himself noted real bureaucracy will less optimal effective ideal type model
each weber's principles degenerate utilized analyze individual level organization
implemented group setting organization form efficiency effectiveness achieved especially regards better output
especially true bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification merits specialization job-scope labour hierarchy power rules discipline
demerits however competencies efficiency effectiveness unclear contradictory especially dealing oversimplified matters
dehumanized bureaucracy inflexible distributing job-scope every worker having specialize day without rotating tasks fear decreasing output tasks often routine contribute boredom
thus employees sometimes feel part organization's work vision missions
consequently any sense belonging long term
furthermore type organization tends invite exploitation underestimate potential employees creativity workers brushed aside favour strict adherence rules regulations procedures
inspirations weber's thinking strongly influenced german idealism particularly neo-kantianism exposed through heinrich rickert professorial colleague university freiburg
especially important weber's work neo-kantian belief reality essentially chaotic incomprehensible rational order deriving way human mind focuses attention certain aspects reality organises resulting perceptions
weber's opinions regarding methodology social sciences show parallels work contemporary neo-kantian philosopher pioneering sociologist georg simmel
weber also influenced kantian ethics nonetheless came think obsolete modern age lacking religious certainties
last respect influence friedrich nietzsche's philosophy evident
according stanford encyclopedia philosophy deep tension kantian moral imperatives nietzschean diagnosis modern cultural world apparently gives such darkly tragic agnostic shade weber's ethical worldview
another major influence weber's life writings karl marx workings socialist thought academia active politics
while weber shares marx's consternation bureaucratic systems maligns them being capable advancing their own logic detriment human freedom autonomy weber views conflict perpetual inevitable does host spirit materially available utopia
though influence mother's calvinist religiosity evident throughout weber's life work though maintained deep lifelong interest study religions weber open fact personally irreligious
political economist economic historian weber belonged youngest german historical school economics represented academics such gustav von schmoller student werner sombart

sociology max weber
science attempts interpretive understanding social action order thereby arrive causal explanation course effects
— max weber weber concerned question objectivity subjectivity
weber distinguished social action social behavior noting social action must understood through how individuals subjectively relate another
study social action through interpretive means verstehen must based upon understanding subjective meaning purpose individuals attach their actions
social actions may easily identifiable objective means much subjective ends understanding those ends scientist subject yet another layer subjective understanding scientist
weber noted importance subjectivity social sciences makes creation fool-proof universal laws much difficult natural sciences amount objective knowledge social sciences may achieve precariously limited
overall weber supported goal objective science noted unreachable goal although definitely worth striving
there no absolutely objective scientific analysis culture
knowledge cultural reality
knowledge particular points view
objective analysis cultural events proceeds according thesis ideal science reduction empirical reality laws meaningless
knowledge social laws knowledge social reality rather various aids used our minds attaining end
— max weber objectivity social science 1904 principle methodological individualism holds social scientists should seek understand collectivities such nations cultures governments churches corporations etc
solely result context actions individual persons traced weber particularly first chapter economy society argues individuals treated agents course subjectively understandable action
other words weber argued social phenomena understood scientifically extent captured models behaviour purposeful individuals models weber called ideal types actual historical events will necessarily deviate due accidental irrational factors
analytical constructs ideal type never exist reality provide objective benchmarks against real-life constructs measured
know no scientifically ascertainable ideals
sure makes our efforts arduous past since expected create our ideals within our breast very age subjectivist culture
— max weber 1909 weber's methodology developed context wider debate methodology social sciences methodenstreit
weber's position close historicism understood social actions being heavily tied particular historical contexts analysis required understanding subjective motivations individuals social actors
thus weber's methodology emphasises use comparative historical analysis
therefore weber interested explaining how certain outcome result various historical processes rather predicting outcome those processes future
rationalisation many scholars described rationalisation question individual freedom increasingly rational society main theme weber's work
theme situated larger context relationship psychological motivations cultural values beliefs primarily religion structure society usually determined economy
rationalisation weber understood first individual cost-benefit calculation second wider bureaucratic organisation organisations finally general sense opposite understanding reality through mystery magic disenchantment
fate our times characterised rationalisation intellectualisation above disenchantment world— max weber weber began studies subject protestant ethic spirit capitalism argued redefinition connection work piety protestantism especially ascetic protestant denominations particularly calvinism shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed achieving economic gain
protestant religion christian piety towards god expressed through one's secular vocation secularisation calling
rational roots doctrine argued soon grew incompatible larger religious latter eventually discarded
weber continued investigation matter later works notably studies bureaucracy classification legitimate authority three types rational-legal traditional charismatic rational-legal through bureaucracy dominant modern world
these works weber described saw society's movement towards rationalisation
similarly rationalisation seen economy development highly rational calculating capitalism
weber also saw rationalisation main factors setting european west apart rest world
rationalisation relied deep changes ethics religion psychology culture changes first took place western civilisation
weber depicted secularisation western culture also especially development modern societies viewpoint rationalisation
new structures society marked differentiation two functionally intermeshing systems taken shape around organisational cores capitalist enterprise bureaucratic state apparatus
weber understood process institutionalisation purposive-rational economic administrative action
degree everyday life affected cultural societal rationalisation traditional forms life early modern period differentiated primarily according one's trade dissolved
— jürgen habermas modernity's consciousness time 1990 features rationalisation include increasing knowledge growing impersonality enhanced control social material life
weber ambivalent towards rationalisation while admitting responsible many advances particular freeing humans traditional restrictive illogical social guidelines also criticised dehumanising individuals cogs machine curtailing their freedom trapping them bureaucratic iron cage rationality bureaucracy
related rationalisation process disenchantment world becoming explained less mystical moving polytheistic religions monotheistic ones finally godless science modernity
those processes affect society removing sublime values

protestant ethic spirit capitalism main article protestant ethic spirit capitalism cover german edition protestant ethic spirit capitalism weber's essay protestant ethic spirit capitalism most famous work
argued work should viewed detailed study protestantism rather introduction weber's later works especially studies interaction various religious ideas economic behaviour part rationalisation economic system
protestant ethic spirit capitalism weber put forward thesis calvinist ethic ideas influenced development capitalism
noted post-reformation shift europe's economic centre away catholic countries such france spain italy toward protestant countries such netherlands england scotland germany
weber also noted societies having protestants those highly developed capitalist economy
similarly societies different religions most successful business leaders protestant
weber thus argued roman catholicism impeded development capitalist economy west other religions such confucianism buddhism elsewhere world
development concept calling quickly gave modern entrepreneur fabulously clear conscience also industrious workers gave employees wages their ascetic devotion calling co-operation ruthless exploitation them through capitalism prospect eternal salvation
— max weber christian religious devotion historically accompanied rejection mundane affairs including economic pursuit
weber showed certain types protestantism notably calvinism supportive rational pursuit economic gain worldly activities dedicated seeing them endowed moral spiritual significance
weber argued there many reasons look origins modern capitalism religious ideas reformation
particular protestant ethic specifically calvinist ethic motivated believers work hard successful business reinvest their profits further development rather frivolous pleasures
notion calling meant each individual take action indication their salvation just being member church enough
predestination also reduced agonising over economic inequality further meant material wealth taken sign salvation afterlife
believers thus justified pursuit profit religion instead being fuelled morally suspect greed ambition their actions motivated highly moral respected philosophy
weber called spirit capitalism protestant religious ideology behind inevitably led capitalist economic system
theory often viewed reversal marx's thesis economic base society determines other aspects
weber abandoned research protestantism because colleague ernst troeltsch professional theologian begun work book social teachings christian churches sects
another reason weber's decision troeltsch's work already achieved desired area laying groundwork comparative analysis religion society

weber focused those aspects chinese society different those western europe especially those aspects contrasted puritanism
work also questioned why capitalism develop china
focused issues chinese urban development chinese patrimonialism officialdom chinese religion philosophy primarily confucianism taoism areas chinese development differed most distinctively european route
according weber confucianism puritanism mutually exclusive types rational thought each attempting prescribe way life based religious dogma
notably both valued self-control restraint oppose accumulation wealth
however both those qualities just means final goal here divided key difference
confucianism's goal cultured status position while puritanism's goal create individuals tools god

actively working wealth unbecoming proper confucian

weber's view hinduism india like confucianism china barrier capitalism
indian caste system made very difficult individuals advance society beyond their caste
activity including economic activity seen unimportant context advancement soul
weber ended research society religion india bringing insights previous work china discuss similarities asian belief systems
notes beliefs saw meaning life otherworldly mystical experience
social world fundamentally divided educated elite following guidance prophet wise man uneducated masses whose beliefs centered magic
asia there no messianic prophecy give plan meaning everyday life educated uneducated alike
weber juxtaposed such messianic prophecies also called ethical prophecies notably near east region exemplary prophecies found asiatic mainland focused reaching educated elites enlightening them proper ways live one's life usually little emphasis hard work material world
those differences prevented countries occident following paths earlier chinese indian civilisations
next work ancient judaism attempt prove theory
ancient judaism main article ancient judaism book ancient judaism fourth major work sociology religion weber attempted explain factors resulted early differences oriental occidental religiosity
contrasted innerworldly asceticism developed western christianity mystical contemplation kind developed india
weber noted aspects christianity sought conquer change world rather withdraw imperfections
fundamental characteristic christianity compared far eastern religions stems originally ancient jewish prophecy
weber claimed judaism fathered christianity islam crucial rise modern occidental state judaism's influence important hellenistic roman cultures
weber's premature death 1920 prevented following planned analysis psalms book job talmudic jewry early christianity islam
economy society main article economy society magnum opus economy society weber distinguished three ideal types religious attitudes world-flying mysticism world-rejecting asceticism inner-worldly asceticism
defined magic pre-religious activity
theodicy fortune misfortune theodicy fortune misfortune within sociology theory weber suggested how members different social classes adopt different belief systems theodices explain their social situation
concept theodicy expanded mainly thought weber addition ethical considerations subject religion
there ethical part religion including soteriology 2 theodicy
these mean respectively how people understand themselves able correct relationship supernatural powers how explain evil why bad things seem happen those seem good people
there separation different theodicies regard class
theodicies misfortune tend belief wealth other manifestations privilege indications signs evil
contrast theodicies fortune emphasise notion privileges blessing deserved
weber also writes affluent embrace good fortune theodicies emphasise prosperity blessing god
[while] theodices misfortune emphasise affluence sign evil suffering world will rewarded next
thus these two distinctions applied class structure within society denomination racial segregation within religion
weber defines importance societal class within religion examining difference two theodicies class structures apply
concept work ethic attached theodicy fortune thus because protestant work ethic there contribution higher class outcomes education among protestants
those without work ethic clung theodicy misfortune believing wealth happiness granted afterlife
another example how belief religious theodicy influences class those lower status poor cling deep religiousness faith way comfort themselves provide hope prosperous future while those higher status cling sacraments actions prove their right possessing greater wealth
these two theodicies found denominational segregation within religious community
main division seen mainline protestant evangelical denominations their relation class their particular theodicy pertains
example mainline churches their upper class congregations promote[d] order stability conservatism doing proved powerful source legitimation status quo existing disparities distribution wealth power because much wealth church comes congregation
contrast pentecostal churches adopted theodicy misfortune
instead advocated change intended advance cause justice fairness
thus learned upper class religious churches preach theodicy fortune ultimately support capitalism corporation while churches adopted theodicy misfortune instead preached equality fairness
politics government political sociology weber's most influential contributions politics vocation essay
therein weber unveils definition state entity possesses monopoly legitimate use physical force
weber politics sharing state's power various groups political leaders those wield power
politician must man true christian ethic understood weber being ethic sermon mount say injunction turn other cheek
adherent such ethic ought rather understood saint saints according weber appropriately follow
political realm no realm saints politician ought marry ethic ultimate ends ethic responsibility must possess both passion vocation capacity distance himself subject exertions governed
weber distinguished three ideal types political leadership alternatively referred three types domination legitimisation authority charismatic domination familial religious traditional domination patriarchs patrimonialism feudalism legal domination modern law state bureaucracy
view every historical relation rulers ruled contained such elements analysed basis tripartite distinction
notes instability charismatic authority forces routinise structured form authority
pure type traditional rule sufficient resistance ruler lead traditional revolution
move towards rational-legal structure authority utilising bureaucratic structure inevitable end
thus theory sometimes viewed part social evolutionism theory
ties broader concept rationalisation suggesting inevitability move direction
bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge
— max weber weber described many ideal types public administration government masterpiece economy society 1922
critical study bureaucratisation society became most enduring parts work
weber began studies bureaucracy whose works led popularisation term
many aspects modern public administration go back classic hierarchically organised civil service continental type called weberian civil service
most efficient rational way organising bureaucratisation weber key part rational-legal authority furthermore saw key process ongoing rationalisation western society
weber listed several preconditions emergence bureaucracy growth space population being administered growth complexity administrative tasks being carried out existence monetary economy these resulted need efficient administrative system
development communication transportation technologies made efficient administration possible popularly requested democratisation rationalisation culture resulted demands new system treat everybody equally
weber's ideal bureaucracy characterised hierarchical organisation delineated lines authority fixed area activity action taken recorded basis written rules bureaucratic officials needing expert training rules being implemented neutrally career advancement depending technical qualifications judged organisations individuals
decisive reason advance bureaucratic organisation purely technical superiority over any other form organisation
— max weber while recognising bureaucracy most efficient form organisation even indispensable modern state weber also saw threat individual freedoms ongoing bureaucratisation leading polar night icy darkness increasing rationalisation human life traps individuals aforementioned iron cage bureaucratic rule-based rational control
order counteract bureaucrats system needs entrepreneurs politicians
social stratification weber also formulated three-component theory stratification social class social status political party conceptually distinct elements
social class based economically determined relationship market owner renter employee etc
status class based non-economic qualities like honour prestige religion
party class refers affiliations political domain
three dimensions consequences weber called life chances opportunities improve one's life
city part overarching effort understand unique development western world weber produced detailed general study city characteristic locus social economic relations political arrangements ideas eventually came define west
resulted monograph titled city probably compiled research conducted 1911–1913 published posthumously 1921
1924 incorporated second part economy society chapter xvi city non-legitimate domination

developed social context alien asiatic cultures
context consisted political problems engendered bourgeois status-group city without neither judaism nor christianity nor development hellenistic thinking conceivable
— max weber weber argued judaism early christianity theology later political party modern science possible urban context reached full development west alone
also saw history medieval european cities rise unique form non-legitimate domination successfully challenged existing forms legitimate domination traditional charismatic rational-legal prevailed until then medieval world
new domination based great economic military power wielded organised community city-dwellers citizens
economics weber regarded himself primarily political economist professorial appointments economics though today contributions field largely overshadowed role founder modern sociology
economist weber belonged youngest german historical school economics
great differences school's interests methods hand those neoclassical school modern mainstream economics largely derives other explain why weber's influence economics today hard discern
max weber pioneer delineating connection capitalism exceptionalism
earlier texts maximiliano korstanje explores american exceptionalism effects current means productions
contribution existent literature paramount importance because two main reasons
first most important relates capitalism protestantism
course nothing new since max weber past
however korstanje adds though weber correct side confirming connection reform capitalism key role played norse mythology left behind

secondly impossibility understand future led english speaking societies construct risk-prone culture resulted ulrich beck dubbed “risk society”
criticism exerted uneven distribution capitalism should explained “economy salved peoples” formulated weber
methodological individualism though research interests line those german historicists strong emphasis interpreting economic history weber's defence methodological individualism social sciences represented important break school embracing many arguments made against historicists carl menger founder austrian school economics context academic methodenstreit debate over methods late 19 th century
phrase methodological individualism come common usage modern debates connection microeconomics macroeconomics coined austrian-american economist joseph schumpeter 1908 way referring views weber

marginalism psychophysics unlike other historicists weber also accepted marginal theory value also called marginalism taught students

economic calculation weber like colleague werner sombart regarded economic calculation especially double-entry bookkeeping method business accounting most important forms rationalisation associated development modern capitalism
weber's preoccupation importance economic calculation led develop critique socialism system lacked mechanism allocating resources efficiently order satisfy human needs
socialist intellectuals like otto neurath realised completely socialised economy prices exist central planners resort in-kind rather monetary economic calculation
