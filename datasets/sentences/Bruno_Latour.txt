main works laboratory life after early career efforts latour shifted research interests focus laboratory scientists
latour rose importance[citation needed] following 1979 publication laboratory life social construction scientific facts co-author steve woolgar
book authors undertake ethnographic study neuroendocrinology research laboratory salk institute
early work argued naïve descriptions scientific method theories stand fall outcome single experiment inconsistent actual laboratory practice
laboratory latour woolgar observed typical experiment produces inconclusive data attributed failure apparatus experimental method large part scientific training involves learning how make subjective decision data keep data throw out
latour woolgar argued untrained observers entire process resembles unbiased search truth accuracy mechanism ignoring data contradicts scientific orthodoxy
latour woolgar produced highly heterodox controversial picture sciences
drawing work gaston bachelard advance notion objects scientific study socially constructed within laboratory—that cannot attributed existence outside instruments measure them minds interpret them

latour's 1987 book science action how follow scientists engineers through society key texts sociology scientific knowledge famously second principle follows scientist engineers speak name new allies shaped enrolled representatives among other representatives add these unexpected resources tip balance force their favor

never modern latour's work nous n’avons jamais été modernes essais d’anthropologie symétrique first published french
soon translated english catherine porter published 1993 never modern
latour encouraged reader anthropology science re-think re-evaluate our mental landscape
evaluated work scientists contemplated contribution scientific method knowledge work blurring distinction across various fields disciplines
latour argued society never really modern promoted nonmodernism amodernism over postmodernism modernism antimodernism
stance never modern minor divisions alone separate westerners now other collectives
latour viewed modernism era believed annulled entire past wake
presented antimodern reaction defending such entities spirit rationality liberty society god even past
postmoderns according latour also accepted modernistic abstractions real
contrast nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry science technology hand society other
latour also referred impossibility returning premodernism because precluded large scale experimentation benefit modernism
latour attempted prove through case studies fallacy old object/subject nature/society compacts modernity traced back plato
refused concept out there versus here
rendered object/subject distinction simply unusable charted new approach towards knowledge work circulating reference
latour considered nonmoderns playing different field vastly different post-moderns
referred much broader much less polemical creation unknown territory playfully referred middle kingdom
1998 historian science margaret c
jacob argued latour's politicized account development modernism 17 th century fanciful escape modern western history

authors criticized latour's methodology including katherine pandora history science professor university oklahoma
her review pandora's hope katherine pandora states [latour's] writing stimulating fresh times genuinely moving also display distractingly mannered style rococo zeal compounding metaphors examples definitions abstractions frustrate even readers approach work best intentions notwithstanding inclusion nine-page glossary terms liberal use diagrams attempt achieve utmost clarity
addition epistemological concerns latour also explores political dimension science studies pandora's hope
two chapters draw plato's gorgias means investigating highlighting distinction content context
katherine pandora states her review hard caught up author's obvious delight deploying classic work antiquity bring current concerns sharper focus following along manages leave reader impression protagonists socrates callicles dialogue each other latour well
although latour frames discussion classical model examples fraught political issues current continuing relevance global warming spread mad cow disease carcinogenic effects smoking mentioned various points pandora's hope
felix stalder's article beyond constructivism towards realistic realism summarizes latour's position political dimension science studies follows these scientific debates artificially kept open order render impossible any political action against these problems those profit them
why critique run out steam? 2004 article latour questioned fundamental premises he'd based most career asking wrong participate invention field known science studies? undertakes trenchant critique own field study generally social criticism contemporary academia
suggests critique currently practiced bordering irrelevancy
maintain any vitality latour argues social critiques require drastic reappraisal our critical equipment deserves much critical scrutiny pentagon budget
231 regain focus credibility latour argues social critiques must embrace empiricism insist cultivation stubbornly realist attitude -- speak like william james
233 latour suggests 90% contemporary social criticism displays two approaches terms fact position fairy position
237 fairy position anti-fetishist arguing objects belief e
religion arts merely concepts created projected wishes desires naive believer fact position argues individuals dominated often covertly without their awareness external forces e
economics gender
238 you see now why feels good critical mind?” asks latour no matter position you take you’re right!” p
238-239 social critics tend use anti-fetishism against ideas personally reject use unrepentant positivist approach fields study consider valuable while thinking perfectly healthy sturdy realist you really cherish
241 these inconsistencies double standards go largely unrecognized social critique because there never any crossover two lists objects fact position fairy position
241 practical result these approaches being taught millions students elite universities several decades widespread influential critical barbarity has—like malign virus created mad scientist—thus far proven impossible control
most troubling latour notes critical ideas appropriated those describes conspiracy theorists including global warming skeptics 9/11 truth movement maybe am taking conspiracy theories too seriously am worried detect those mad mixtures knee-jerk disbelief punctilious demands proofs free use powerful explanation social neverland many weapons social critique
230 reassembling social reassembling social 2005 latour continues reappraisal work developing calls practical metaphysics calls real anything actor whom studying claims source motivation action
someone says inspired god charitable my neighbors obliged recognize ontological weight their claim rather attempting replace their belief god's presence social stuff like class gender imperialism etc
latour’s nuanced metaphysics demands existence plurality worlds willingness researcher chart ever
argues researchers must give up hope fitting their actors structure framework latour believes benefits sacrifice far outweigh downsides their complex metaphysics least respected their recalcitrance recognized their objections deployed their multiplicity accepted
latour talk metaphysics ontology–what really is–means paying close empirical attention various contradictory institutions ideas bring people together inspire them act
here latour's description metaphysics call metaphysics discipline
purports define basic structure world then empirical metaphysics controversies over agencies lead since ceaselessly populate world new drives ceaselessly contest existence others
question then becomes how explore actors' own metaphysics
traditional metaphysicist might object arguing means there multiple contradictory realities since there controversies over agencies since there plurality contradictory ideas people claim basis action god nature state sexual drives personal ambition
objection manifests most important difference traditional philosophical metaphysics latour's nuance latour there no basic structure reality single self-consistent world
unknowably large multiplicity realities worlds terms exists–one each actor’s sources agency inspirations action
actors bring real metaphysics being
task researcher find basic structure explains agency recognize metaphysical innovations proposed ordinary actors
mapping those metaphysical innovations involves strong dedication relativism latour argues
relativist researcher learns actors' language records say does appeal higher structure explain actor's motivations
relativist takes seriously [actors] obstinately saying follows direction indicated their fingers designate 'makes them act'
relativist recognizes plurality metaphysics actors bring being attempts map them rather reducing them single structure explanation
