5 th century ce sanskrit author likely written two influential sanskrit texts vākyapadīya sanskrit grammar linguistic philosophy foundational text indian grammatical tradition explaining numerous theories word sentence including theories came known under name sphoṭa work bhartrhari also discussed logical problems such liar paradox paradox unnameability unsignfiability become known bhartrhari's paradox śatakatraya work sanskrit poetry comprising three collections 100 stanzas each may may same author composed two mentioned grammatical works
medieval tradition indian scholarship assumed both texts written same person
[citation needed] modern philologists sceptical claim owing argument dated grammar date subsequent poetry
[citation needed] since 1990 s however scholars agreed both works may indeed contemporary case plausible there bhartrihari both texts
[citation needed] both grammar poetic works enormous influence their respective fields
grammar particular takes holistic view language countering compositionality position mimamsakas others
poetry constitute short verses collected three centuries hundred poems each
each century deals different rasa aesthetic mood whole poetic work very highly regarded both within tradition modern scholarship
name bhartrihari also sometimes associated bhartrihari traya shataka legendary king ujjaini st century
contents date identity 2 vākyapadīya 3 śatakatraya 4 notes 5 external links date identity account chinese traveller yi-jing indicates bhartrihari's grammar known 670 ce may buddhist poet
based scholarly opinion formerly attributed grammar separate author same name 7 th century ce
however other evidence indicates much earlier date bhartrihari long believed lived seventh century ce according testimony chinese pilgrim yijing [
known buddhist philosopher dignaga pushed date back fifth century ce
— period c
450–500 definitely later 425–450 following erich frauwallner 450–510 perhaps 400 ce even earlier
yi-jing's other claim bhartrihari buddhist does seem hold philosophical position widely held offshoot vyakaran grammarian school closely allied realism naiyayikas distinctly opposed buddhist positions like dignaga closer phenomenalism
also opposed other m im amsakas like kumarila bhatta
however ideas subsequently influenced buddhist schools may led yi-jing surmise may buddhist
thus whole seems likely traditional sanskritist view poet śatakatraya same grammarian bhartṛhari may accepted
leading sanskrit scholar ingalls 1968 submitted see no reason why should written poems well grammar metaphysics like dharmakirti shankaracharya many others
yi jing himself appeared think same person grammarian bhartṛhari author vakyapadiya renowned vacillation buddhist monkhood life pleasure having written verses subject
vākyapadīya main article sphoṭa bhartrihari's views language build earlier grammarians such patanjali quite radical
key element conception language notion sphoṭa term may based ancient grammarian sphoṭāyana referred pāṇini now lost
mahabhashya patanjali 2 nd century bce uses term sphoṭa denote sound language universal while actual sound dhvani may long short vary other ways
distinction may thought similar present notion phoneme
bhatrihari however applies term sphota each element utterance varṇa letter syllable pada word vākya sentence
create linguistic invariant argues these must treated separate wholes varṇasphoṭa padasphoṭa vākyasphoṭa respectively
example same speech sound varṇa may different properties different word contexts e
assimilation sound cannot discerned until whole word heard
further bhartrihari argues sentence-holistic view meaning saying meaning utterance known after entire sentence vākyasphoṭa received composed individual atomic elements linguistic units may change their interpretation based later elements utterance
further words understood context sentence whose meaning whole known
argument based language acquisition e
consider child observing exchange below elder adult uttama-vṛddha full-grown says bring horse younger adult madhyama-vṛddha half-grown reacts bringing horse child observing may now learn unit horse refers animal
unless child knew sentence meaning priori difficult infer meaning novel words
thus grasp sentence meaning whole reach words parts sentence word meanings parts sentence meaning through analyis synthesis abstraction apoddhāra
sphoṭa theory influential opposed many others
later mimamsakas like kumarila bhatta c
650 ce strongly rejected vākyasphoṭaview argued denotative power each word arguing composition meanings abhihitānvaya
prabhakara school c
670 among mimamsakas however took less atomistic position arguing word meanings exist determined context anvitābhidhāna
