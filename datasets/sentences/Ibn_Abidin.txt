family came long line scholars therefore well respected
studied qur'an starting very young age received first general degree authorization first teacher shaykh muhammad al-kuzbari al-kabir 12 years old
memorized qur'an before reached maturity
very determined student
after reciting qur'an father's shop receiving criticism sought perfect work studied vigorously under several well-known scholars
after much hard work received four degrees authorization
legal views islamic law mufti determines right wrong thing legal situation conflict
general rules decision making must first base answer noble prophet sallalahu alaihi wa salam qur'an then head their particular school law then their mufti predecessors
there no bias decisions based previous methods
however reality case
ibn abidin excellent example how fatwa system worked reality
ibn abidin modernistic view
being mufti ottoman era influenced islam scholars ottoman's does follow general rules listed above
also went back shortened edited added own opinion damascus mufti before hamid al-imadi
went against respecting ancestors' decisions sound
obvious area flexibility involves view urf local custom
urf ijtihad ibn abidin's view urf important include fatwas
claimed many things change time laws need flexible order account change urf
point many rules change change time
poses huge problem keeping fatwas unbiased
ibn abidin's solution problem shari'a law built goal making life believer free suffering urf included decision making result suffering
states jurists should proceed strictly rigidly adhering authoritative books opinions madhhab should also pay attention needs people time else harm does will outweigh benefit
other jurists besides ibn abidin consider current urf their fatwas also
their fatwa contradicted founder their madhhab then their reasoning their founder alive during their time given same decision
another issue relates use current urf fatwas use ijtihad individual interpretation exertion effort
use ijtihad ended long before ibn abidin mufti
however ibn abidin uses great amounts effort order determine correct answer problem fatwa using knowledge common urf own reasoning
seems believed ijtihad still acceptable use certain circumstances
example states “if abu hanifa ruling matter hand then view followed
then look views abu yusuf then muhammad al-shaybani then zufar then hasan then other lesser jurists no answer then incumbent mufti look way deep thinking ijtihad
names following abu hanifa those well-known muftis scholars before ibn abidin’s time
believed ijtihad acceptable there no other option
however truly exception
also considered acceptable use own reason times changed law required change
required change usually meant times becoming corrupted laws needed made stricter
marriage time ibn abidin marriage extremely important part society
everyone expected married each person expected marry someone within their same social class
example woman lower class marry man middle class vice versa
came deciding equality two individuals determine two individuals married equally matched ibn abidin came realization occupations considered same status locations
classified those lowest class consist barbers metal workers shepherds bath-keepers added there clear distinction because depended custom location persons lived
came equality ibn abidin also stated non-arab lower arab learned non-arab higher ignorant non-arab
meant muslim higher class non-muslim non-muslim believer higher class no-muslim non-believer
each child male female assigned wali guardian find them spouse arrange their marriage
wali traditionally father grandfather complications arose child orphan father grandfather
complications arose wali considered unable make proper decisions
ibn abidin came up fatwas these problems
guardian orphan responsibility wali
also wali disregards good marriage offer court right interfere
both females males considered choice whom married after reached maturity
however males free pick their wives while women considered approve marriage silent after having specifics offer
after marriage ibn abidin husband obligated provide wife no matter her financial situation based her social standing
example upper-class wife fed wheat bread meat lunch middle class wife fed bread animal fat lower-class wife fed bread cheese
according ibn abidin many other scholars both man woman expected fulfill each other sexually
husband receiving pleasure wife then right stop providing her divorce her unless she disability
wife receiving pleasure husband other hand wife wait year before she ask court divorce
relationship state ibn abidin other state-appointed muftis complex relationship state
fear speaking out against state
example ibn abidin adds note end fatwas taxes criticizes state’s collection taxes
“but most extraordinary taxes imposed villages these days preservation either property people mere oppression aggression most expenses governor subordinates buildings residence residences soldiers pays messengers sulton…levied our country twice yearly there many sums top taken presents assistants attendants…” opinion wahhabi ibn abidin describes wahhabis “fanatic fringe group
wahhabis take texts extremely literally goes directly against views ibn abidin
death ibn abidin died 21 rabi al-thani year 1252 ah age 54 years
funeral prayer led own teacher saýīd al-ĥalabī broke down weeping clutching own beard ‘i treasuring you comes after my old age’
prayers held sināniyyah mosque buried accordance will near grave shaykh álāuddin al-ĥaşkafī author durr al-mukhtār next great muĥaddith şāliĥ al-jaynīnī damascus
radd al muhtar ibn abidin systematically went through works positions school depth preciseness
regarding encompassing scope ibn `abidin hanafi fiqh then mufti beirut shaykh muhammad effendi al-hulawani takmila radd al-muhtar “i never heard any lesson like ibn `abidin
