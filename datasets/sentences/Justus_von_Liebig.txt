received small stipend without laboratory funding access facilities
38–41 situation complicated presence existing faculty professor wilhelm zimmermann 1780–1825 taught general chemistry part philosophy faculty leaving medical chemistry pharmacy professor philipp vogt medical faculty
vogt happy support reorganization pharmacy taught liebig became responsibility faculty arts rather faculty medicine
zimmermann found himself competing unsuccessfully liebig students their lecture fees
refused allow liebig use existing space equipment finally committed suicide 19 july 1825
deaths zimmermann professor blumhof taught technology mining opened way liebig apply full professorship
liebig appointed ordentlicher chair chemistry 7 december 1825 receiving considerably increased salary laboratory allowance

transforming chemical education liebig's laboratory giessen wilhelm trautschold liebig's laboratory chimistes celebres liebig's extract meat company trading card 1929 liebig several associates proposed create institute pharmacy manufacturing within university
42 senate however uncompromisingly rejected their idea stating university's task train apothecaries soapmakers beer-brewers dyers vinegar-distillers
43 17 december 1825 ruled any such institution private venture
decision actually worked liebig's advantage
independent venture ignore university rules accept both matriculated non-matriculated students
42–43 liebig's institute widely advertised pharmaceutical journals opened 1826
44–45 classes practical chemistry laboratory procedures chemical analysis taught addition liebig's formal courses university
1825 1835 laboratory housed guardroom disused barracks edge town
main laboratory space 38 square metres including small lecture room storage closet main room ovens work tables
open colonnade outside used dangerous reactions
liebig work there 9 students time
lived cramped apartment floor above wife children
47 liebig first chemists organize laboratory present form engaging students empirical research large scale through combination research teaching
methods organic analysis enabled direct analytical work many graduate students
liebig's students many german states well britain united states helped create international reputation their doktorvater
laboratory became renowned model institution teaching practical chemistry
47 also significant emphasis applying discoveries fundamental research development specific chemical processes products
1833 liebig able convince chancellor justin von linde include institute within university
47 1839 obtained government funds build lecture theatre 2 separate laboratories designed architect paul hofmann
new chemistry laboratory featured innovative glass-fronted fume cupboards venting chimneys
58 1852 left giessen munich 700 students chemistry pharmacy studied liebig
57 instrumentation drawing apparatus liebig's manuel pour l'analyse des substances organiques 1848 kaliapparat lower right modern apparatus modern liebig condensers significant challenge facing nineteenth century organic chemists lack instruments methods analysis support accurate replicable analyses organic materials
many chemists worked problem organic analysis including french joseph louis gay-lussac swedish jöns jacob berzelius before liebig developed version apparatus determining carbon hydrogen oxygen content organic substances 1830
involved ingenious array five glass bulbs called kaliapparat trap oxidation products
water absorbed bulb hygroscopic calcium chloride weighed measure hydrogen
carbon dioxide absorbed potassium hydroxide solution three lower bulbs used measure carbon
oxygen calculated difference
coal fire used combustion
weighing carbon hydrogen directly rather estimating them volumetrically greatly increased method's accuracy measurement
48–51 liebig's assistant carl ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques producing kaliapparat demonstrated them visitors
50 liebig's kaliapparat simplified technique quantitative organic analysis rendered routine
brock suggests availability superior technical apparatus reason why liebig able attract many students laboratory
50 method combustion analysis used pharmaceutically certainly made possible many contributions organic agricultural biological chemistry
76–77 liebig also popularized use counter-current water-cooling system distillation still referred liebig condenser
84 liebig himself attributed vapor condensation device german pharmacist johann friedrich august gottling made improvements 1794 design discovered independently german chemist christian ehrenfried weigel 1771 french scientist p
poisonnier 1779 finnish chemist johan gadolin 1791
although widely adopted until after liebig's death safety legislation finally prohibited use mercury making mirrors liebig proposed process silvering eventually became basis modern mirror-making
1835 reported aldehydes reduce silver salts metallic silver
after working other scientists carl august von steinheil approached liebig 1856 see develop silvering technique capable producing high-quality optical mirrors use reflecting telescopes
liebig able develop blemish-free mirrors adding copper ammoniated silver nitrate sugar
attempt commercialize process drive out mercury mirror-making injurious influence workers' health unsuccessful
136–139 organic chemistry liebig laboratory giessen liebig-museum pharmaceutical laboratory giessen liebig's frequent collaborators friedrich wöhler
met 1826 frankfurt after independently reporting preparation two substances cyanic acid fulminic acid apparently same composition very different characteristics
silver fulminate investigated liebig explosive whereas silver cyanate found wöhler
after reviewing disputed analyses together agreed both valid
discovery these other substances led jöns jacob berzelius suggest idea isomers substances defined simply number kind atoms molecule also arrangement those atoms
72 1832 justus liebig friedrich wöhler published investigation oil bitter almonds
transformed pure oil several halogenated compounds further transformed other reactions
throughout these transformations single compound named benzoyl preserves nature composition unchanged nearly associations other bodies
79 their experiments proved group carbon hydrogen oxygen atoms behave like element take place element exchanged elements chemical compounds
laid foundation doctrine compound radicals seen early step development structural chemistry
1830 s period intense investigation organic compounds liebig students vigorous debate theoretical implications their results
liebig published wide variety topics personally averaging thirty papers per year 1830 1840
76 liebig isolated individual substances also studied their interrelationships ways degraded metamorphosed other substances looking clues understanding both chemical composition physiological function
other significant contributions liebig during time include examination nitrogen content bases77 study chlorination isolation chloral 183283 identification ethyl radical 183482 oxidation alcohol formation aldehyde 183584 polybasic theory organic acids 183886–87 degradation urea 1837
88–89 writing analysis urine complex organic product made declaration reveals both changes occurring chemistry over short time impact own work
89 time many chemists such jöns jakob berzelius still insisted hard fast separation organic inorganic liebig asserted production organic substances no longer belongs just living organisms
must seen probable certain shall able produce them our laboratories
sugar salicin morphine will artificially produced
course yet know how because yet know precursors these compounds arise
shall come know them
— [liebig woehler 1838] liebig's arguments against any chemical distinction living physiological dead chemical processes proved great inspiration several students others interested materialism
though liebig distanced himself direct political implications materialism tacitly supported work karl vogt 1817–1895 jacob moleschott 1822–1893 ludwig buechner 1824–1899
plant nutrition 1840 s liebig attempting apply theoretical knowledge organic chemistry real-world problems food availability
book die organische chemie ihrer anwendung auf agricultur und physiologie organic chemistry application agriculture physiology 1840 promoted idea chemistry revolutionize agricultural practice increasing yields lowering costs
widely translated vociferously critiqued highly influential
liebig's book discussed chemical transformations within living systems both plant animal outlining theoretical approach agricultural chemistry
first part book focused plant nutrition second chemical mechanisms putrefaction decay
148 liebig's awareness both synthesis degradation led become early advocate conservation promoting ideas such recycling sewage
250–270 liebig argued against prevalent theories role humus plant nutrition held decayed plant matter primary source carbon plant nutrition
fertilizers believed act breaking down humus making easier plants absorb
associated such ideas belief sort vital force distinguished reactions involving organic opposed inorganic materials
early studies photosynthesis identified carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen important disagreed over their sources mechanisms action
carbon dioxide known taken oxygen released during photosynthesis researchers suggested oxygen obtained carbon dioxide rather water
hydrogen believed come primarily water
researchers disagreed whether sources carbon nitrogen atmospheric soil-based
xv-xxi nicolas-théodore de saussure's experiments reported recherches chimiques sur végétation 1804 suggested carbon obtained atmospheric rather soil-based sources water likely source hydrogen
also studied absorption minerals plants observed mineral concentrations plants tended reflect their presence soil plants grown
however implications de saussure's results theories plant nutrition neither clearly discussed nor easily understood
xxii-xxvii liebig reaffirmed importance de saussures' findings used them critique humus theories while regretting limitations de saussure's experimental techniques
using precise methods measurement basis estimation pointed out contradictions such inability existing soil humus provide enough carbon support plants growing
xxix late 1830 s researchers like karl sprengel using liebig's methods combustion analysis assess manures concluding their value attributed their constituent minerals
106 liebig synthesized ideas mineral theory plant nutrition added own conviction inorganic materials provide nutrients effectively organic sources
148 theory mineral nutrients liebig identified chemical elements nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k essential plant growth
reported plants acquire carbon c hydrogen h atmosphere water h2 o
well emphasizing importance minerals soil argued plants feed nitrogen compounds derived air
assertion source contention many years turned out true legumes other plants
181 liebig's barrel liebig also popularized carl sprengel's theorem minimum known law minimum stating plant growth determined total resources available scarcest available resource
plant's development limited essential mineral relatively shortest supply
concept limitation visualized liebig's barrel metaphorical barrel each stave represents different element
nutrient stave shorter others will cause liquid contained barrel spill out level
qualitative version principles used determining application fertilizer modern agriculture
organic chemistry intended guide practical agriculture
liebig's lack experience practical applications differences editions book fueled considerable criticism
nonetheless liebig’s writings profound impact agriculture spurring experiment theoretical debate germany england france
165 most recognized accomplishments development nitrogen-based fertilizer
first two editions book 1840 1842 liebig reported there sufficient nitrogen atmosphere argued nitrogen-based fertilizer needed grow healthiest possible crops
120 liebig believed nitrogen supplied form ammonia recognized possibility substituting chemical fertilizers natural ones animal dung etc
later became convinced nitrogen sufficiently supplied precipitation ammonia atmosphere argued vehemently against use nitrogen-based fertilizers many years
early commercial attempt produce own fertilizers unsuccessful due lack testing actual agricultural conditions lack nitrogen mixtures
121–124 liebig's difficulties reconciling theory practice reflected real world agriculture complex first realized
publication seventh german edition agricultural chemistry moderated views admitting mistakes returning position nitrogen-based fertilizers beneficial even necessary
179 nitrogen fertilizers now widely used throughout world their production substantial segment chemical industry
plant animal physiology liebig's work applying chemistry plant animal physiology especially influential
1842 published chimie organique appliquée à physiologie animale et à pathologie published english animal chemistry organic chemistry applications physiology pathology presenting chemical theory metabolism
185 experimental techniques used liebig others often involved controlling measuring diet monitoring analyzing products animal metabolism indicators internal metabolic processes
liebig saw similarities plant animal metabolism suggested nitrogenous animal matter similar derived plant matter
categorized foodstuffs two groups nitrogenous materials believed used build animal tissue non-nitrogenous materials believed involved separate processes respiration generation heat
184 french researchers such jean-baptiste dumas jean-baptiste boussingault believed animals assimilated sugars proteins fats plant materials lacked ability synthesize them
liebig's work suggested common ability plants animals synthesize complex molecules simpler ones
experiments fat metabolism convinced animals must able synthesize fats sugars starch
187 other researchers built upon work confirming abilities animals synthesize sugar build fat
189–190 liebig also studied respiration point measuring ingesta excreta 855 soldiers bodyguard grand duke hessen-darmstadt entire month
191 outlined extremely speculative model equations attempted explain how protein degradation might balance within healthy body result pathological imbalances cases illness inappropriate nutrition
191–193 proposed model justifiably criticized
berzelius stingingly stated facile kind physiological chemistry created writing table
194 ideas liebig enthusiastically incorporated supported further research
third last edition animal chemistry 1846 substantially revised include equations
195–197 third area discussed animal chemistry fermentation putrefaction
liebig proposed chemical explanations processes such eremacausis organic decomposition describing rearrangement atoms result unstable affinities reacting external causes such air already decaying substances
205 liebig identified blood site body's chemical factory believed processes synthesis degradation took place
presented view disease terms chemical process healthy blood attacked external contagia secreting organs sought transform excrete such substances failure lead their elimination through skin lungs other organs potentially spreading contagion
again although world much complicated theory many individual ideas later proved wrong liebig managed synthesize existing knowledge way significant implications doctors sanitarians social reformers
english medical journal lancet reviewed liebig's work translated chemical lectures part mission establish new era medicine
207 liebig's ideas stimulated significant medical research led development better techniques testing experimental models metabolism pointed chemistry fundamental understanding health disease
214 1850 liebig investigated spontaneous human combustion dismissing simplistic explanations based ethanol due alcoholism
liebig chemistry food methods cookery liebig drew upon work plant nutrition plant animal metabolism develop theory nutrition significant implications cookery
researches chemistry food 1847 liebig argued important eat meat fibre also meat juices contained various inorganic chemicals
these vital ingredients lost during conventional boiling roasting cooking liquids discarded
optimum nutritional quality liebig advised cooks should either sear meat initially retain fluids retain use cooking liquids soups stews
217–218 liebig acclaimed lancet revealing true principles cookery physicians promoted rational diets based ideas
well-known british cookery writer eliza acton responded liebig modifying cookery techniques third edition her modern cookery private families subtitling edition accordingly
218–219 liebig's idea searing meat seals juices though still widely believed true
liebig's extract meat company memorial trading card commemorating justus von liebig liebig's extract meat company justus von liebig statue munich germany main article liebig's extract meat company building theories nutritional value meat fluids seeking inexpensive nutrition source europe’s poor liebig developed formula producing beef extract
details published 1847 benefit should
placed command large number persons possible extension manufacture consequently reduction cost
production economically feasible europe meat expensive uruguay new south wales meat inexpensive byproduct leather industry
1865 liebig partnered belgian engineer george christian giebert named scientific director liebig's extract meat company located fray bentos uruguay
other companies also attempted market meat extracts under name liebig's extract meat
britain competitor's right use name successfully defended grounds name fallen general use become generic term before creation any particular company
judge asserted purchasers must use their eyes considered presentation products sufficiently different enable discriminating consumer determine products bore liebig's signature supported baron liebig himself
liebig's company initially promoted their meat tea curative powers nutritional value cheap nutritious alternative real meat
after claims nutritional value questioned emphasized convenience flavour marketing comfort food
liebig company worked popular cookery writers various countries popularize their products
