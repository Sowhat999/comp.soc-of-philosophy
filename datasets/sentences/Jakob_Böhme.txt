böhme's full works first printed 1730
theology böhme's cosmogony philosophical sphere wonder eye eternity 1620
chief concern böhme's writing nature sin evil redemption
consistent lutheran theology böhme preached humanity fallen state divine grace state sin suffering forces evil included fallen angels rebelled against god god's goal restore world state grace
there serious departures accepted lutheran theology however such rejection sola fide passage way christ will say will willingly good earthly flesh carry me keepeth me back cannot yet shall saved grace merits christ
comfort myself merit sufferings will receive me mere grace without any merits my own forgive me my sins
such say like man knoweth food good health yet will eat eateth poison instead thereof whence sickness death will certainly follow
another place böhme may depart accepted theology though open question due somewhat obscure oracular style description fall necessary stage evolution universe
difficulty theology fact mystical vision reinterpreted reformulated
according f
von ingen böhme order reach god man go through hell first
god exists without time space regenerates himself through eternity böhme restates trinity truly existing novel interpretation
god father fire gives birth son whom böhme calls light
holy spirit living principle divine life
however clear böhme never claimed god sees evil desirable necessary part divine will bring forth good
threefold life böhme states [i]n order nature evil thing cannot produce good thing out itself evil thing generates another
böhme believe there any divine mandate metaphysically inherent necessity evil effects scheme thing
john pordage commentator böhme böhme whensoever attributes evil eternal nature considers fallen state became infected fall lucifer
evil seen disorder rebellion perversion making spirit nature's servant say perversion initial divine order

de tribus principiis three principles divine being böhme subsumed seven principles trinity
dark world father qualities 1-2-3 2

cosmology interpretation böhme's cosmology necessary humanity return god original unities undergo differentiation desire conflict — rebellion satan separation eve adam their acquisition knowledge good evil — order creation evolve new state redeemed harmony perfect original state innocence allowing god achieve new self-awareness interacting creation both part distinct himself
free will becomes most important gift god gives humanity allowing us seek divine grace deliberate choice while still allowing us remain individuals
böhme saw incarnation christ sacrificial offering cancel out human sins offering love humanity showing god's willingness bear suffering necessary aspect creation
also believed incarnation christ conveyed message new state harmony possible
somewhat odds lutheran teachings suggestion god somehow incomplete without creation even controversial emphasis faith self-awareness rather strict adherence dogma scripture
[citation needed] marian views böhme believed son god became human through virgin mary
before birth christ god recognized himself virgin
virgin therefore mirror god's wisdom knowledge
böhme follows luther christians views mary within context christ
unlike luther does address himself dogmatic issues very much human side mary
like other women she human therefore subject sin
after god elected her grace become mother son she inherit status sinlessness
mary move word word moved mary böhme explaining her grace came christ
mary blessed among women because her qualifications because her humility
mary instrument god example god shall forgotten eternity god became human her
böhme unlike luther believe mary ever virgin
her virginity after birth jesus unrealistic böhme
true salvation christ mary
importance mary human like every us she gave birth jesus christ human being
mary human according böhme christ stranger our brother
christ must grow us mary
she became blessed accepting christ
reborn christian mary temporal disappears heavenly part remains eternity
böhme's peculiar theological language involving fire light spirit permeates theology marian views does distract much fact basic positions lutheran exception virginity mary invents idiosyncratic view
