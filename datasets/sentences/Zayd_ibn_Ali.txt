short time umar ibn adbul aziz power changes made long-lasting effect minds people
associate umar ibn adbul aziz zayd ibn ali grandson husayns also very upset
zayd ibn ali then started receiving letters kufa asking come kufa
740 abu hanifah supported friend zayd ibn ali against umayyad ruler asked friend go kufa
abu hanifah malik ibn anas zayd ibn ali's family advised zayd ibn ali go kufa feared zayd ibn ali get betrayed kufa
zayd ibn ali felt needed oppose umayyads force
zaydis believe arrival kufa last hour zayd ibn ali people kufa asked may god mercy you! you say matter abu bakr umar ibn al-khattab? zayd ibn ali heard anyone my family renouncing them both nor saying anything good them
entrusted government behaved justly people acted according qur'an sunnah
after withdrew their support zayd ibn ali fought bravely against umayyad army killed
scholars kept up pressure umayyads umayyads tried re-impose taxes abolished umar ibn adbul aziz population also got rebellious
later abbasids came power tried change laws above law 767 abu hanifah died prison refused support abbasid ruler al-mansur malik ibn anas flogged
then abbasids backed off allowed laws madina implemented again book muwatta imam malik malik ibn anas based laws based quran example muhammad based work committee main jurist madina headed qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr jafar sadiq's grandfather abu bakr's grandson again implemented
later abbasids tried impose mutazilite philosophy change laws present themselves being above law
imam ahmed hanbal confronted ruler tortured sent unlit baghdad prison cell nearly thirty months
767 abu hanifah died prison refused support abbasid ruler al-mansur later mutazilite philosophy failed hanifi jurisprudence implemented
since imam abu hanifa studied took knowledge both imam ja'far al-sadiq zayd ibn ali abu hanifa zaidi's hanafis used ja'fari jurisprudence
terms law modern zaidi school quite similar hanafi school these scholars also laid foundations science medieval islamic world scientists mathematicians list muslim scientists taught these scholars then taught other scholars
islam discourages belief superstition
hence these scholars felt humans truly appreciate god magnificence studying gods creation
quran 453 indeed within heavens earth signs believers
them islam science linked students these scholars also preserved translated greek latin manuscripts during dark ages europe
also instrumental making european renaissance many early advances astronomy made because muslims relied sun moon stars times pray time ramadan direction mecca direction pray navigation desert sea
muslims follow quran example muhammad
differences denominations islam primarily political
sunnis give importance quran books containing hadith examples muhammad since early scholars four caliphs worked together sunnis accept first four caliphs elected community
also accept early imams scholars their knowledge
while shias constitute around 10–20% muslims hereditary accept ali fourth caliph accept hassan accept certain male descendent ali through son hussein imams
different branches shia accept different brothers
elite old empires middle east felt discontented passage their empires like arab caliphs their ideas eventually found their way religious differences
during abbasid period many history books also written reference future generations recording everything people saying early history islam
subject same level authenticity checks
many cases preislamic customs populations converted islam also absorbed their rituals
also amplified differences
during arab-byzantine wars byzantines benefited there political disagreements muslims used time establishment themata
ideas kharijites initially very extreme their support ali's caliphate later killed ali made peace mu'awiyah also lived
after witnessing happens due lust wealth power others like hasan basra advocated piety condemnation worldliness later influenced development sufis
further developed al-ghazali
