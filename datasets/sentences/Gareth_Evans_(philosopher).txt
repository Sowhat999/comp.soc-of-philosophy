work brief career evans made substantial contributions logic metaphysics philosophy language philosophy mind
aside strawson michael dummett john mc dowell important influences work
evans many uk took up project developing formal semantics natural languages instigated donald davidson 1960 s 1970 s
co-edited truth meaning 1976 john mc dowell subject
also paper causal theory names 1973 heavily criticised certain lines theory reference derived saul kripke's naming necessity 1972/1980 work keith donnellan
one-page paper analysis there vague objects? 1978 drew dozens papers response now considered key work metaphysics
varieties reference evans's book varieties reference 1982 unfinished time death
edited publication supplemented appendices drawn notes mc dowell subsequently influential both philosophy mind philosophy language
background theory reference prior 1970 s dominated view meaning ordinary name description object example aristotle means author de caelo
russell's view taken many equivalent frege's view description frege calls term's sense
following kripke's naming necessity 1972/1980 lectures view came prevail names no descriptive content sense referent name fit meaning whichever object initial cause name's being used
evans's project evans concedes names general descriptive meanings although contends cases argues proponents new theory much too simplistic view
argues calls russell's principle person cannot thinking object unless knows non-trivial way object thinking
particular evans argues person must discriminating conception object 1982 p
russell's work evans also draws point thoughts thoughts objects perceiving example such their object exist possible think thought
these calls russellian thoughts
then claims certain version new theory calls photograph model mental representation 1982 p
78 violates russell's principle
according photograph model causal antecedents information involved mental state
claimed sufficient determine object state concerns 1982 p
view named because similar view many people take how photograph comes something
thus photograph model contrary russell's principle may thought object without discriminating knowledge object just long mental state caused appropriate way example perhaps sort causal chain originates object
evans argues any causal theory like photograph model must restricted certain ways necessary consider various kinds russellian thoughts people objects specify each case conditions must met them meet russell's principle—only under those conditions thought specific object objects singular thought
particular evans discusses length calls generality constraint
evans states thus
subject credited thought f then must conceptual resources entertaining thought g every property being g conception 1982 p
generality constraint according evans intended capture structure there thought
evans puts thought john happy something common thought harry happy thought john happy something common thought john sad 1982 p
generality constraint requires thought john happy example object john then must able conceive object john having different properties such being sad
also defends reading frege derived part michael dummett's work according frege's notion sense equivalent description indeed remains essential theory reference abandoned descriptivism 1982 §1
kinds reference bulk text considers three kinds reference objects argues number conditions must obtain reference occur
considers first demonstrative reference speaks thinks object visible one's vicinity
argues these presuppose among other things having correct conception kind object ability conceive oneself located objective space orient oneself within space must move smoothly through time space able track object's movements continuously perception
next considers reference oneself then reference way capacity recognition one's ability re-identify object presented even available present
evans famously considers phenomenon immunity error through misidentification--a phenomenon certain types judgment cannot wrong object judgment misidentifying see 1982 especially §6
6 & §7
phenomenon may exemplified incoherence following judgment upon feeling pain someone seems feeling pain feeling pain?
while phenomenon noticed philosophers before evans argues tended think applies judgments concerning oneself one's conscious experiences failed recognise general phenomenon occur any sort demonstrative judgment
furthermore charge philosophers such ludwig wittgenstein blue brown books elizabeth anscombe her first person having wrongly concluded such cases show first-person pronoun does refer anything
language issues last third book evans turns problems reference objects actively depend use language
here treats use proper names seem presuppose much knowledge part speaker demonstrative recognition-based identification
refer object never encountered using name name received right sort linguistic social practice—even apparently no true beliefs object
also considers problems reference objects fictions hallucinations meaning saying something exists doesn't
here draws explicitly kripke's john locke lectures reference existence
