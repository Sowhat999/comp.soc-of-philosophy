thought philosophy will main article world will representation schopenhauer 1815 second critical five years initial composition die welt als wille und vorstellung key focus schopenhauer investigation individual motivation
before schopenhauer hegel popularized concept zeitgeist idea society consisted collective consciousness moved distinct direction dictating actions members
schopenhauer reader both kant hegel criticized their logical optimism belief individual morality determined society reason
schopenhauer believed humans motivated their own basic desires wille zum leben will live directed mankind
schopenhauer human desire futile illogical directionless extension human action world
man indeed wants cannot will wants
sense adhered fichtean principle idealism world subject
idealism presented immediately commits ethical attitude unlike purely epistemological concerns descartes berkeley
schopenhauer will malignant metaphysical existence controls actions individual intelligent agents ultimately observable phenomena—an evil terminated via mankind's duties asceticism chastity
credited most famous opening lines philosophy world my representation
will schopenhauer kant called thing-in-itself
nietzsche greatly influenced idea will while developing different direction
art aesthetics main article arthur schopenhauer's aesthetics schopenhauer human desiring willing craving cause suffering pain
temporary way escape pain through aesthetic contemplation method comparable zapffe's sublimation
aesthetic contemplation allows escape pain—albeit temporarily—because stops perceiving world mere presentation
instead no longer perceives world object perception therefore subject principle sufficient grounds time space causality separated rather becomes perception thus no longer separate perceiver perception world will representation section 34
immersion world no longer views oneself individual suffers world due one's individual will rather becomes subject cognition perception pure will-less timeless section 34 essence ideas world shown
art practical consequence brief aesthetic contemplation attempts depict one's immersion world thus tries depict essence/pure ideas world
music schopenhauer purest form art because depicted will itself without appearing subject principle sufficient grounds therefore individual object
according daniel albright schopenhauer thought music art merely copy ideas actually embodied will itself
deemed music timeless universal language comprehended everywhere imbue global enthusiasm possession significant melody
mathematics schopenhauer's realist views mathematics evident criticism contemporary attempts prove parallel postulate euclidean geometry
writing shortly before discovery hyperbolic geometry demonstrated logical independence axiom—and long before general theory relativity revealed does necessarily express property physical space—schopenhauer criticized mathematicians trying use indirect concepts prove held directly evident perception
euclidean method demonstration brought forth own womb most striking parody caricature famous controversy over theory parallels attempts repeated every year prove eleventh axiom also known fifth postulate
axiom asserts indeed through indirect criterion third intersecting line two lines inclined each other precise meaning less two right angles produced far enough must meet
now truth supposed too complicated pass self-evident therefore needs proof no such proof produced just because there nothing immediate
throughout writings schopenhauer criticized logical derivation philosophies mathematics mere concepts instead intuitive perceptions
fact seems me logical method way reduced absurdity
precisely through controversies over together futile attempts demonstrate directly certain merely indirectly certain independence clearness intuitive evidence appear contrast uselessness difficulty logical proof contrast instructive amusing
direct certainty will admitted here just because no merely logical certainty following concept thus resting solely relation predicate subject according principle contradiction
eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines synthetic proposition priori such guarantee pure empirical perception perception just immediate certain principle contradiction itself proofs originally derive their certainty
bottom holds good every geometrical theorem …
although schopenhauer see no justification trying prove euclid's parallel postulate see reason examining another euclid's axioms
surprises me eighth axiom figures coincide another equal another rather attacked
coinciding another either mere tautology something quite empirical belonging pure intuition perception external sensuous experience
thus presupposes mobility figures matter alone movable space
consequently reference coincidence another forsakes pure space sole element geometry order pass over material empirical
follows kant's reasoning
ethics schopenhauer's moral theory proposed compassion drive moral acts
according schopenhauer compassion alone good object acts cannot inspired either prospect personal utility feeling duty
mankind also guided egoism malice
egotistic acts those guided self-interest desire pleasure happiness
schopenhauer believed most our deeds belong class
acts malice different egotistic acts
case acts compassion these target personal utility
their aim cause damage others independently personal gains
believed like swami vivekananda unity one-self also believed ego origin pain conflicts reduction ego frames moral principles
punishment schopenhauer 1852 according schopenhauer whenever make choice assume necessary decision preceded something ensued call ground reason accurately motive resultant action
choices made freely
our actions necessary determined because every human being even every animal after motive appeared must carry out action alone accordance inborn immutable character
definite action inevitably results particular motive influences person's given unchangeable character
state schopenhauer claimed punishes criminals prevent future crimes
does placing beside every possible motive committing wrong powerful motive leaving undone inescapable punishment
accordingly criminal code complete register possible counter-motives criminal actions possibly imagined
law fulfillment namely punishment directed essentially future past
distinguishes punishment revenge revenge motivated happened hence past such
retaliation wrong inflicting pain without any object future revenge no other purpose consolation suffering endured sight suffering caused another
such thing wickedness cruelty cannot ethically justified
object punishment
deterrence crime
object purpose future distinguish punishment revenge punishment object inflicted fulfillment law
way does proclaim itself inevitable infallible every future case thus obtains law power deter
should capital punishment legal? safeguarding lives citizens asserted capital punishment therefore absolutely necessary
murderer schopenhauer condemned death according law must true now used mere means complete right
public security principal object state disturbed indeed abolished law remains unfulfilled
murderer life person must means fulfilling law thus re-establishing public security
schopenhauer disagreed those abolish capital punishment
those like abolish should given answer 'first remove murder world then capital punishment ought follow
people according schopenhauer cannot improved
influenced strong motives overpower criminal motives
schopenhauer declared real moral reform possible determent deed
claimed doctrine original
previously appeared writings plato seneca hobbes pufendorf anselm feuerbach
schopenhauer declared their teaching corrupted subsequent errors therefore need clarification
god even though schopenhauer ended treatise freedom human will postulate everyone's responsibility their character consequently acts—the responsibility following one's being will noumenon also characters creations come—he considered views incompatible theism grounds fatalism generally responsibility evil
schopenhauer's philosophy dogmas christianity lose their significance last judgment no longer preceded anything—the world itself last judgment
whereas god existed evil
psychology philosophers traditionally impressed tribulations sex schopenhauer addressed related concepts forthrightly
ought rather surprised thing [sex] plays throughout important part human life hitherto practically disregarded philosophers altogether lies before us raw untreated material
named force within man felt took invariable precedence over reason will live will life wille zum leben defined inherent drive within human beings indeed creatures stay alive force inveigles us reproducing
schopenhauer refused conceive love either trifling accidental rather understood immensely powerful force lay unseen within man's psyche dramatically shaped world ultimate aim love affairs
important other aims man's life therefore quite worthy profound seriousness everyone pursues
decided nothing less composition next generation
these ideas foreshadowed discovery evolution freud's concepts libido unconscious mind evolutionary psychology general
political social thought politics bust frankfurt am main schopenhauer's politics most part echo system ethics latter being expressed die beiden grundprobleme ethik available english two separate books basis morality freedom will
ethics also occupies quarter central work world will representation
occasional political comments parerga paralipomena manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself proponent limited government
essential thought state should leave each man free work out own salvation long government thus limited prefer ruled lion [his] fellow rats —
monarch rather democrat
schopenhauer shared view thomas hobbes necessity state state action check destructive tendencies innate our species
also defended independence legislative judicial executive branches power monarch impartial element able practise justice practical everyday sense cosmological
declared monarchy natural man intelligence under monarchical government much better chance against irreconcilable ever-present foe stupidity disparaged republicanism unnatural unfavourable higher intellectual life arts sciences
schopenhauer own admission give much thought politics several times writes proudly how little attention paid political affairs [his] day
life spanned several revolutions french german government few continent-shaking wars indeed maintain aloof position minding times eternities
many disparaging remarks germany germans
typical example german even good somewhat lengthy words mouth thinks slowly give time reflect
schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy northern white races due their sensitivity creativity except ancient egyptians hindus whom saw equal highest civilization culture apart ancient hindus egyptians found exclusively among white races even many dark peoples ruling caste race fairer colour rest therefore evidently immigrated example brahmans incas rulers south sea islands
due fact necessity mother invention because those tribes emigrated early north there gradually became white develop their intellectual powers invent perfect arts their struggle need want misery their many forms brought climate
order make up parsimony nature out came their high civilization
despite adamantly against differing treatment races fervently anti-slavery supported abolitionist movement united states
describes treatment [our] innocent black brothers whom force injustice delivered [the slave-master's] devilish clutches belonging blackest pages mankind's criminal record
schopenhauer additionally maintained marked metaphysical political anti-judaism
schopenhauer argued christianity constituted revolt against materialistic basis judaism exhibiting indian-influenced ethics reflecting aryan-vedic theme spiritual self-conquest
saw opposed held ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism superficiality worldly jewish spirit while other religions endeavor explain people symbols metaphysical significance life religion jews entirely immanent furnishes nothing mere war-cry struggle other nations
views women schopenhauer's 1851 essay women expressed opposition called teutonico-christian stupidity reflexive unexamined reverence abgeschmackten weiberveneration female
schopenhauer women directly fitted acting nurses teachers our early childhood fact themselves childish frivolous short-sighted
opined women deficient artistic faculties sense justice expressed opposition monogamy

essay does give compliments however women decidedly sober their judgment [men] sympathetic suffering others
schopenhauer's controversial writings influenced many friedrich nietzsche nineteenth-century feminists

believe woman succeeds withdrawing mass rather raising herself above mass she grows ceaselessly man
heredity eugenics schopenhauer age 58 16 may 1846 schopenhauer believed personality intellect inherited
quotes horace's saying brave good brave descended odes iv 4 29 shakespeare's line cymbeline cowards father cowards base things sire base iv 2 reinforce hereditarian argument
mechanistically schopenhauer believed person inherits level intellect through mother personal character through one's father
belief heritability traits informed schopenhauer's view love placing highest level importance
schopenhauer final aim love intrigues comic tragic really importance other ends human life
turns upon nothing less composition next generation
weal woe any individual human race come here stake

analysts e
keith ansell-pearson suggested schopenhauer's advocacy anti-egalitarianism eugenics influenced neo-aristocratic philosophy friedrich nietzsche initially considered schopenhauer mentor
animal welfare consequence monistic philosophy schopenhauer very concerned welfare animals
individual animals including humans essentially same being phenomenal manifestations underlying will
word will designated force power impulse energy desire closest word signify both real essence external things also our own direct inner experience
since every living thing possesses will then humans animals fundamentally same recognize themselves each other
reason claimed good person sympathy animals our fellow sufferers
compassion animals intimately associated goodness character may confidently asserted cruel living creatures cannot good man
nothing leads definitely recognition identity essential nature animal human phenomena study zoology anatomy
assumption animals without rights illusion our treatment them no moral significance positively outrageous example western crudity barbarity
universal compassion guarantee morality
1841 praised establishment london society prevention cruelty animals also animals' friends society philadelphia
schopenhauer even went far protest against use pronoun reference animals because led treatment them though inanimate things
reinforce points schopenhauer referred anecdotal reports look eyes monkey shot also grief baby elephant whose mother killed hunter
very attached succession pet poodles
schopenhauer criticized spinoza's belief animals used mere means satisfaction humans
views homosexuality pederasty third expanded edition world will representation 1859 schopenhauer added appendix chapter metaphysics sexual love
also homosexuality benefit preventing ill-begotten children
concerning stated vice considering appears work directly against aims ends nature matter important greatest concern her must fact serve these very aims although indirectly means preventing greater evils
shrewdly anticipating interpretive distortion part popular mind attempted scientific explanation pederasty personal advocacy otherwise described act terms spiritual ethics objectionable aberration schopenhauer sarcastically concludes appendix statement expounding these paradoxical ideas wanted grant professors philosophy small favour very disconcerted ever-increasing publicization my philosophy carefully concealed
done giving them opportunity slandering me saying defend commend pederasty
intellectual interests affinities indology schopenhauer read latin translation upanishads french writer anquetil du perron translated persian translation prince dara shikoh entitled sirre-akbar great secret
impressed their philosophy called them production highest human wisdom believed contained superhuman concepts
upanishads great source inspiration schopenhauer
writing them most satisfying elevating reading exception original text possible world solace my life will solace my death
well known book oupnekhat upanishad lay open table invariably studied before sleeping night
called opening up sanskrit literature greatest gift our century predicted philosophy knowledge upanishads become cherished faith west
schopenhauer first introduced 1802 latin upanishad translation through friedrich majer
met during winter 1813–1814 weimar home schopenhauer's mother according biographer sanfranski
majer follower herder early indologist
schopenhauer begin serious study indic texts however until summer 1814
sansfranski maintains 1815 1817 schopenhauer another important cross-pollination indian thought dresden
through neighbor two years karl christian friedrich krause
krause then minor rather unorthodox philosopher attempted mix own ideas ancient indian wisdom
krause also mastered sanskrit unlike schopenhauer two developed professional relationship
krause schopenhauer learned meditation received closest thing expert advice concerning indian thought
most noticeable case schopenhauer’s work significance chandogya upanishad whose mahavakya tat tvam asi mentioned throughout world will representation
buddhism schopenhauer noted correspondence doctrines four noble truths buddhism
similarities centered principles life involves suffering suffering caused desire taṇhā extinction desire leads liberation
thus three four truths buddha correspond schopenhauer's doctrine will
buddhism however while greed lust unskillful desire ethically variable skillful unskillful neutral
schopenhauer will ontological primacy over intellect other words desire understood prior thought
schopenhauer felt similar notions puruṣārtha goals life vedānta hinduism
schopenhauer's philosophy denial will attained either personal experience extremely great suffering leads loss will live knowledge essential nature life world through observation suffering other people
however buddhist nirvāṇa equivalent condition schopenhauer described denial will
nirvāṇa extinguishing person western scholars thought extinguishing literal meaning nirvana flames greed hatred delusion assail person's character
occult historian joscelyn godwin 1945– stated buddhism inspired philosophy arthur schopenhauer through attracted richard wagner
orientalism reflected struggle german romantics words leon poliakov free themselves judeo-christian fetters
contradistinction godwin's claim buddhism inspired schopenhauer philosopher himself made following statement discussion religions wished take results my philosophy standard truth should concede buddhism pre-eminence over others
any case must pleasure me see my doctrine such close agreement religion majority men earth hold their own numbers far followers any other
agreement must yet pleasing me inasmuch my philosophizing certainly under influence [emphasis added]
up till 1818 my work appeared there found europe very few accounts buddhism
buddhist philosopher nishitani keiji however sought distance buddhism schopenhauer
while schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical such summary methodology resolutely empirical rather speculative transcendental philosophy
science such no articles faith accordingly nothing assumed existing except either positively given empirically demonstrated through indubitable conclusions
also note actual world knowable us remains both material limit our consideration
argument buddhism affected schopenhauer’s philosophy any other dharmic faith loses credence viewed light fact schopenhauer begin serious study buddhism until after publication world will representation 1818
scholars started revise earlier views schopenhauer's discovery buddhism
proof early interest influence however appears schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes transcribed translated urs app buddhism
included recent case study traces schopenhauer's interest buddhism documents influence
other scholarly work questions how similar schopenhauer's philosophy actually buddhism
influences schopenhauer influenced upanishads immanuel kant plato
references eastern philosophy religion appear frequently writing
noted above appreciated teachings buddha even called himself buddhist
philosophy conceived before these teachings available
concerning upanishads vedas writes world will representation reader also received benefit vedas access means upanishads my eyes greatest privilege still young century 1818 may claim before previous centuries then reader say received initiation primeval indian wisdom received open heart will prepared very best way hearing tell
will sound strange many others much less disagreeable might sound conceited contend every detached statements constitute upanishads may deduced necessary result fundamental thoughts enunciate though those deductions themselves no means found there

critique kant hegel schopenhauer march 1859 critique kantian philosophy main article critique kantian philosophy see also basis morality schopenhauer's criticism kant's schemata schopenhauer accepted kant's double-aspect universe phenomenal world experience noumenal true world independent experience
commentators suggest schopenhauer claimed noumenon thing-in-itself basis schopenhauer's concept will
other commentators suggest schopenhauer considered will subset thing-in-itself class namely most directly experience
schopenhauer's identification kantian noumenon
actually existing entity termed will deserves explanation
noumenon kant called ding sich thing itself reality foundation our sensory mental representations external world
kantian terms those sensory mental representations mere phenomena
schopenhauer departed kant description relationship phenomenon noumenon
according kant things-in-themselves ground phenomenal representations our minds schopenhauer other hand believed phenomena noumena two different sides same coin
noumena cause phenomena rather phenomena simply way our minds perceive noumena according principle sufficient reason
explained fully schopenhauer's doctoral thesis fourfold root principle sufficient reason 1813
schopenhauer's second major departure kant's epistemology concerns body
kant's philosophy formulated response radical philosophical skepticism david hume claimed causality observed empirically
schopenhauer begins arguing kant's demarcation external objects knowable phenomena thing itself noumenon contains significant omission
there fact physical object know intimately know any object sense perception our own body
know our human bodies boundaries occupy space same way other objects known through our named senses
though seldom think our body physical object know even before reflection shares object's properties
understand watermelon cannot successfully occupy same space oncoming truck know tried repeat experiment our own body obtain similar results know even understand physics involved
know our consciousness inhabits physical body similar other physical objects known phenomena
yet our consciousness commensurate our body
most us possess power voluntary motion
usually aware breathing our lungs beating our heart unless somehow our attention called them
our ability control either limited
our kidneys command our attention their schedule rather choose
few us any idea our liver doing right now though organ needful lungs heart kidneys
conscious mind servant master these other organs
these organs agenda conscious mind choose over limited power
schopenhauer identifies noumenon desires needs impulses us name will saying participate reality otherwise unachievable world outside mind through will
cannot prove our mental picture outside world corresponds reality reasoning through will know without thinking world stimulate us
suffer fear desire these states arise involuntarily arise prior reflection arise even conscious mind prefer hold them bay
rational mind schopenhauer leaf borne along stream pre-reflective largely unconscious emotion
stream will through will through logic participate underlying reality beyond mere phenomena
reason schopenhauer identifies noumenon call our will
criticism kant schopenhauer claimed sensation understanding separate distinct abilities
yet kant object known through each them
kant [t]here two stems human knowledge
namely sensibility understanding objects being given former [sensibility] thought latter [understanding]
schopenhauer disagreed
asserted mere sense impressions objects given sensibility
according schopenhauer objects intuitively perceived understanding discursively thought reason kant claimed understanding thinks objects through concepts 2 reason seeks unconditioned ultimate answer why?
schopenhauer kant's mistake regarding perception resulted obscurity difficult confusion exhibited transcendental analytic section critique
lastly schopenhauer departed kant how interpreted platonic ideas
world will representation schopenhauer explicitly stated
kant used word [idea] wrongly well illegitimately although plato already taken possession used most appropriately
instead schopenhauer relied upon neoplatonist interpretation biographer diogenes laërtius lives opinions eminent philosophers
reference plato’s ideas schopenhauer quotes laërtius verbatim explanatory footnote
diogenes laërtius iii 12 plato ideas natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere cetera esse similia ad istarum similitudinem consistencia
plato teaches ideas exist nature speak patterns prototypes remainder things resemble them exist their copies
critique hegel schopenhauer expressed dislike philosophy contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel many times published works
following quotations typical say so-called philosophy fellow hegel colossal piece mystification will yet provide posterity inexhaustible theme laughter our times pseudo-philosophy paralyzing mental powers stifling real thinking most outrageous misuse language putting place hollowest most senseless thoughtless confirmed success most stupefying verbiage should quite right

criticism schopenhauer's personal life british philosopher historian bertrand russell deemed schopenhauer insincere person because judging life habitually dined well good restaurant many trivial love-affairs sensual passionate exceedingly quarrelsome unusually avaricious
hard find life evidences any virtue except kindness animals
