strands both fiction non-fiction precursor other naipaul novels
intermittently dense even obscure also beautiful passages especially descriptive ones fictional tropical island isabella
subject sex appeared explicitly first time naipaul's work
plot extent there centres protagonist ralph singh east indian-west indian politician isabella
singh exile london attempting write political memoirs
earlier immediate aftermath decolonization number british colonies late 1950 s early 1960 s singh shared political power powerful african-caribbean politician

title novella free state two young expatriate europeans drive across african country remains nameless offers clues uganda kenya rwanda
novella speaks many themes
colonial era ends africans govern themselves
political chaos frequently violent takes hold newly decolonized countries
young idealistic expatriate whites attracted these countries seeking expanded moral sexual freedoms
rootless their bonds land tenuous slightest danger leave
older conservative white settlers contrast committed staying even face danger
young expatriates though liberal racially prejudiced
old settlers unsentimental sometimes brutal show compassion
young engrossed narrow preoccupations uncomprehending dangers surround them
old knowledgeable armed ready defend themselves
events unfolding along car trip conversation during become means exploring these themes
writing guerrillas late december 1971 news killings michael x's commune arima filtered out naipaul accompanied pat arrived trinidad cover story
time strains their marriage
naipaul although dependent pat frequenting prostitutes sexual gratification
pat alone

naipaul accused misogyny committing acts chronic physical abuse against mistress 25 years margaret murray later publicly spoke out against efforts claim she didn't mind abuse
