disagreement over owned rights character primary motivation mc farlane other artists form image comics although argument related towards disagreements writers artists character creators
mc farlane used characters without gaiman's permission royalty payments gaiman believed copyrighted work being infringed upon violated their original oral agreement
mc farlane initially agreed gaiman signed away any rights characters negotiated gaiman effectively 'swap' mc farlane's interest character marvelman mc farlane believes purchased interest character eclipse comics liquidated gaiman interested being able continue aborted run title later claimed gaiman's work work-for-hire mc farlane owned gaiman's creations entirely
