these writers focused so-called 'thin ethical concepts' such good bad right wrong arguing employed affirm something true thing question rather express emotion hare's case imperative
sort analysis 'thin ethical concepts tied special partitioning account concrete thick concepts such cowardly 'cruel gluttonous these supposed combine non-cognitive evaluative element obvious merely descriptive element
foot's purpose criticize distinction underlying account thin concepts
because particular way she approached defense cognitive truth-evaluable character moral judgment these essays crucial bringing question rationality morality fore
practical considerations involving thick ethical concepts cruel cowardly it's hers promised her wouldn't move people act way rather another descriptive any other judgment pertaining human life
differ thought such done tuesday take three gallons paint admixture any non-factual attitude-expressing moral element fact human beings reasons things cowardly cruel
her lifelong devotion question appears periods her work
may found her continuing discussion platonic immoralists callicles thrasymachus nietzsche
rationality morality why moral? early works question why moral? question her may divide questions why just? why temperate? etc
her doctrine underwent surprising series reversals
moral beliefs she argued received virtues courage temperance justice cultivated rationally thus rational act accordance them
thick ethical concepts she emphasized without using expression her defense cognitive character moral judgment associated such rationally cultivated traits
virtues how differ randomly chosen descriptions action
crucial point difference just action action performed tuesday example matter emotive meaning ayer stevenson secret imperatival feature hare
why moral? middle works fifteen years later essay morality system hypothetical imperatives she reversed came justice benevolence virtues especially regard other people
although everyone reason cultivate courage temperance prudence whatever person desires values still rationality just benevolent acts must she thought turn contingent motivations
although many found thesis shocking her then account meant certain respect inspiring famous reinterpretation remark kant she says conscripts army virtue volunteers[citation needed] fact nothing say proof irrationality least unjust people should alarm us our own defense cultivation justice benevolence strike citizens leningrad their devotion city people during terrible years siege contingent
why moral? later work her book natural goodness attempts different line
question most reason tied idea good working practical reason
turn tied idea species animal providing measure good bad operations parts faculties
just know kind animal dealing order instance decide whether eyesight good bad question whether subject's practical reason well developed depends kind animal
idea developed light conception animal kinds species implicitly containing evaluative content may criticized contemporary biological grounds although arguable even basis very deeply entrenched human cognition
our case makes well-constituted practical reason depends fact human beings characterized certain possibilities emotion desire certain anatomy neurological organization forth
once step made becomes possible argue rationality moral considerations new way
humans begin conviction justice genuine virtue
thus conviction well-constituted human practical reason operates considerations justice means taking account other people sort way how human beings live together
thought how live must understood sense compatible fact actual individuals often just dentists understand thought human beings n teeth way compatible many people having fewer
there nothing incoherent thought practical calculation takes account others their good might characterize kind rational social animal
similarly course there nothing incoherent idea form rational life within such considerations alien imposed damaging disturbing individual person
there nothing analytic rationality justice benevolence
rather human conviction justice virtue considerations justice genuine reasons action conviction kind rational being namely human beings first type
there no reason think such kind rational animality impossible there no reason suspect considerations justice frauds
course might suggested precisely case human beings second kind thus justice benevolence esteem artificial false
foot hold considerations machismo lady-likeness artificial false matters mere convention tend put off main things
being how justice position platonic immoralists callicles thrasymachus being how benevolence view nietzsche
case callicles nietzsche apparently shown claiming justice benevolence respectively inculcated warping emotional apparatus individual
foot's book ends attempting defuse evidence nietzsche brings against might called common sense position
she proceeds accepting basic premise way life inculcated damaging individual's passions filling remorse resentment forth true
she employs exactly nietzschean form argument against certain forms femininity example exaggerated forms acceptance etiquette
justice benevolence she claims however suit human beings there no reason accept critique callicles nietzsche case
ethics aesthetics political philosophy nearly foot's published work relates normative meta-ethics
once she move across boundary aesthetics
her 1970 british academy hertz memorial lecture art morality certain contrasts drawn moral aesthetic judgements
she appears never taken professional interest political philosophy
