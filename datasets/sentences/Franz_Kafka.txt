gabriel garcía márquez noted reading kafka's metamorphosis showed possible write different way
prominent theme kafka's work first established short story das urteil father-son conflict guilt induced son resolved through suffering atonement
other prominent themes archetypes include alienation physical psychological brutality characters terrifying quest mystical transformation
kafka's style compared kleist early 1916 review die verwandlung heizer oscar walzel berliner beiträge
nature kafka's prose allows varied interpretations critics placed writing variety literary schools
marxists example sharply disagreed over how interpret kafka's works
accused distorting reality whereas others claimed critiquing capitalism
hopelessness absurdity common works seen emblematic existentialism
kafka's books influenced expressionist movement though majority literary output associated experimental modernist genre
kafka also touches theme human conflict bureaucracy
william burrows claims such work centred concepts struggle pain solitude need relationships
others such thomas mann see kafka's work allegorical quest metaphysical nature god
according gilles deleuze félix guattari themes alienation persecution although present kafka's work over-emphasised critics
argue kafka's work deliberate subversive—and joyful—than may first appear
point out reading work while focusing futility characters' struggles reveals kafka's play humour necessarily commenting own problems rather pointing out how people tend invent problems
work kafka often created malevolent absurd worlds
kafka read drafts works friends typically concentrating humorous prose
writer milan kundera suggests kafka's surrealist humour may inversion dostoyevsky's presentation characters punished crime
kafka's work character punished although crime committed
kundera believes kafka's inspirations characteristic situations came both growing up patriarchal family living totalitarian state
attempts made identify influence kafka's legal background role law fiction
most interpretations identify aspects law legality important work legal system often oppressive
law kafka's works rather being representative any particular legal political entity usually interpreted represent collection anonymous incomprehensible forces
these hidden individual control lives people innocent victims systems beyond their control
critics support absurdist interpretation cite instances kafka describes himself conflict absurd universe such following entry diary enclosed my own four walls found myself immigrant imprisoned foreign country
saw my family strange aliens whose foreign customs rites very language defied comprehension
though want forced me participate their bizarre rituals
however james hawes argues many kafka's descriptions legal proceedings process—metaphysical absurd bewildering nightmarish might appear—are based accurate informed descriptions german austrian criminal proceedings time inquisitorial rather adversarial
although worked insurance trained lawyer kafka keenly aware legal debates day

translation problems english further information franz kafka works kafka often made extensive use characteristic particular german language permits long sentences sometimes span entire page
kafka's sentences then deliver unexpected impact just before full stop—this being finalizing meaning focus
due construction subordinate clauses german require verb positioned end sentence
such constructions difficult duplicate english up translator provide reader same least equivalent effect found original text
german's flexible word order syntactical differences provide multiple ways same german writing translated english
example first sentence kafka's metamorphosis crucial setting understanding entire story als gregor samsa eines morgens aus unruhigen träumen erwachte fand er sich seinem bett zu einem ungeheuren ungeziefer verwandelt
original gregor samsa morning restless dreams awoke found himself bed enormous vermin transformed
literal word-for-word translation another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators how deal author's intentional use ambiguous idioms words several meanings result phrasing difficult precisely translate
such instance found first sentence metamorphosis
english translators often render word ungeziefer insect middle german however ungeziefer literally means animal unclean sacrifice today's german means vermin
sometimes used colloquially mean bug —a very general term unlike scientific insect
kafka no intention labeling gregor protagonist story any specific thing instead wanted convey gregor's disgust transformation
another example kafka's use german noun verkehr final sentence das urteil
literally verkehr means intercourse english either sexual non-sexual meaning addition used mean transport traffic
sentence translated moment unending stream traffic crossed over bridge
double meaning verkehr given added weight kafka's confession brod final line thinking violent ejaculation
