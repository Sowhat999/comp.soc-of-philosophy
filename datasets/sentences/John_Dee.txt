arthur apprentice much father's alchemical scientific work fact often scryer until kelley came along
arthur went become alchemist hermetic author whose works published elias ashmole
regards dee's physical appearance antiquary john aubrey gives following description tall slender
wore gown like artist's gown hanging sleeves slit
very fair clear sanguine complexion
long beard white milk
very handsome man
achievements chart johannes trithemius's steganographia hand john dee copied entire manuscript 1591 thought dee intensely pious christian christianity deeply influenced hermetic platonic-pythagorean doctrines pervasive renaissance
believed numbers basis things key knowledge god's creation act numbering
hermeticism drew belief man potential divine power believed divine power exercised through mathematics
cabalistic angel magic heavily numerological work practical mathematics navigation example simply exalted mundane ends same spectrum antithetical activities many see them today
ultimate goal help bring forth unified world religion through healing breach catholic protestant churches recapture pure theology ancients
advocacy english expansion 1570 dee advocated policy political economic strengthening england imperial expansion new world
manuscript brytannicae reipublicae synopsis 1570 outlined current state elizabethan realm concerned trade ethics national strength
1576 general rare memorials pertayning perfect arte navigation first volume unfinished series planned advocate rise imperial expansion
highly symbolic frontispiece dee included figure britannia kneeling shore beseeching elizabeth protect her empire strengthening her navy
dee used geoffrey's inclusion ireland arthur's imperial conquests argue arthur established 'british empire' abroad
further argued england exploit new lands through colonisation vision become reality through maritime supremacy
dee credited coining term british empire however humphrey llwyd also credited first use term commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum published eight years earlier 1568
dee posited formal claim north america back map drawn 1577–80 noted circa 1494 mr robert thorn father mr eliot bristow discovered newfound land
title royal 1580 invented claim madog ab owain gwynedd discovered america intention ensuring england's claim new world stronger spain
further asserted brutus britain king arthur well madog conquered lands americas therefore their heir elizabeth england priority claim there
reputation significance ten years after dee's death antiquarian robert cotton purchased land around dee's house began digging search papers artifacts
discovered several manuscripts mainly records dee's angelic communications
cotton's son gave these manuscripts scholar méric casaubon published them 1659 together long introduction critical their author true & faithful relation passed many yeers dr
john dee mathematician great fame q
king james their reignes spirits
first public revelation dee's spiritual conferences book extremely popular sold quickly
casaubon believed reality spirits argued introduction dee acting unwitting tool evil spirits believed communicating angels
book largely responsible image prevalent following two half centuries dee dupe deluded fanatic
around same time true faithful relation published members rosicrucian movement claimed dee their number
there doubt however organized rosicrucian movement existed during dee's lifetime no evidence ever belonged any secret fraternity
dee's reputation magician vivid story association edward kelley made seemingly irresistible figure fabulists writers horror stories latter-day magicians
accretion false often fanciful information dee often obscures facts life remarkable themselves
also does nothing promote christian leanings dee looked angels speak how might heal very deep serious rifts roman catholic church reformed church england protestant movement england
queen elizabeth used her court astronomer number occasions because practiced dark arts because deeply religious learned man whom she trusted
re-evaluation dee's character significance came 20 th century largely result work historians charlotte fell-smith dame frances yates
both writers brought focus parallel roles magic science religion held elizabethan renaissance
fell-smith writes there perhaps no learned author history persistently misjudged nay even slandered posterity voice three centuries uplifted even claim fair hearing
surely time cause universal condemnation should examined light reason science perhaps will found exist mainly fact too far advanced speculative thought own age understand
result subsequent re-evaluation dee now viewed serious scholar book-collector devoted christian albeit during very confusing time faith able scientist most learned men day
personal library mortlake largest country before vandalized created enormous sometimes ruinous personal expense considered finest europe perhaps second de thou
well being astrological scientific adviser elizabeth her court early advocate colonisation north america visionary british empire stretching across north atlantic
dee promoted sciences navigation cartography
studied closely gerardus mercator owned important collection maps globes astronomical instruments
developed new instruments well special navigational techniques use polar regions
dee served advisor english voyages discovery personally selected pilots trained them navigation
believed mathematics understood mystically central progress human learning
centrality mathematics dee's vision makes extent modern francis bacon though scholars believe bacon purposely downplayed mathematics anti-occult atmosphere reign james
should noted though dee's understanding role mathematics radically different our contemporary view
dee's promotion mathematics outside universities enduring practical achievement
most writings dee chose write english rather latin make writings accessible general public
mathematical preface euclid meant promote study application mathematics those without university education very popular influential among mecanicians new growing class technical craftsmen artisans
dee's preface included demonstrations mathematical principles readers perform themselves without special education training
calendar dee friend tycho brahe familiar work nicolaus copernicus
many astronomical calculations based copernican assumptions never openly espoused heliocentric theory
dee applied copernican theory problem calendar reform
1583 asked advise queen new gregorian calendar promulgated pope gregory xiii october 1582
advice england should accept albeit seven specific amendments
first these adjustment should 10 days restore calendar time council nicaea 325 ad days restore birth christ
another proposal dee's align civil liturgical years them both start january
perhaps predictably england chose spurn any suggestions papist origins despite any merit may objectively dee's advice rejected
voynich manuscript often associated voynich manuscript
wilfrid michael voynich bought manuscript 1912 suggested dee may owned manuscript sold rudolph ii
dee's contacts rudolph far less extensive previously thought however dee's diaries show no evidence sale
dee however known possessed copy book soyga another enciphered book
works monas hieroglyphica 1564 preface billingsley's euclid billingsley's translation euclid's elements 1570 mystical rule seven planets 1582–83 artefacts objects used dee magic now british museum
british museum holds several items once owned dee associated spiritual conferences dee's speculum mirror obsidian aztec cult object shape hand-mirror brought europe late 1520 s subsequently owned horace walpole
jennifer rampling claimed dee never actually owned object[citation needed]
