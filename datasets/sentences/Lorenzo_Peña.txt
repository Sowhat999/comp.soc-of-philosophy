philosophical views ontophantics ontophantics system philosophical conceptions developed peña years 1974–1995 necessarily coincide those developed recent years
although ontophantics essentially metaphysical doctrine starting point methodological approach through philosophy language based realist semiotic theory effect shown language also against tractarian dichotomy namely reality being
rather regarding sentences states affairs static way logical atomists done ontophantics looks upon them dynamically transitions processes
utter statement mere series successive actions uttering sentence's components transit saying another along temporal dimension
likewise facts nontemporal transitions consisting relation passing thing another
since passages seem subject zeno's paradox arrow paraconsistent logic resorted order solve puzzle
instead blaming contradictions thought language peña ascribes them reality embracing non-classical logic
another feature ontophantics rejection forms essentialism sense considering attributions being-so independent assertions being existence—an opinion peña attributes aristotle alexius meinong
peña's existence-oriented ontology identifies each entity fact existence
ontological truth also identified existence reduplicative property
ontophantics follows frege's view sentences names objects case objects under consideration states affairs
linguistic perspective phenomena nominalization thus gone outlook eliminates any categorical cleavages
such metaphysical theory strongly platonistic
ontophantics also modal realism takes reality all-encompassing thus comprising non-actual worlds
ontophantics contains holistic theory knowledge influenced gonseth quine considering cleavage analytic synthetic judgments matter degree
epistemological holism sort empirical coherentism task human knowledge set up theories confront them experience taken whole gradually modify them
foundationalism any kind rejected reliabilism accepted either since no procedure unconditionally trusted come may
peña rehabilitates induction sound ground even logical truths follows outdated opinion john stuart mill
choice among alternative logical systems made accordance plausible criteria fitness best explanation available evidence thus resorting optimization postulate turn gets circularly warranted epistemological fruitness
optimization postulate rationality ideal also provides ground assuming god's existence
peña's first published book coincidence opposites god quito 1981 discussion proofs god's inexistence canvassed analytical philosophy religion
broached question through combination contradictorial logic non-standard set theory way mirror reversion quine's ml system regards infinite entities being subject principle separation virtue thing comprised set entities certain characteristic extent characteristic
book adopted determinism rejected free will position maintained ever since using lever while grappling issues philosophy law
contradictorial gradualism against other persuasions paraconsistent logic such relevantism brazilian school paraconsistent treatment developed peña belongs fuzzy family founded lotfi
zadeh regards true contradictions situations wherein state affairs enjoys partial existence
approach fuzziness deviates zadeh's main-stream orthodoxy rejecting alethic maximalism embracing principle excluded middle regarding intermediaries degrees both truth falseness being non-being plato's influence discernable here
transitive logic order clarify philosophical proposal peña set up several systems sentential quantificational logic calls «transitive logic» tl partial implementations programme
tl characterized couple negations strong «not all» classical properties weak mere «not» degree-sensitive
fragment tl without strong negation non-conservative extension alan ross anderson nuel belnap's logic relevance e adding funnel principle namely either implies else other words true implies anything
transitive implication partly similar relevant implication although much stronger underlying philosophical motivation entirely different since read «to extent [at least]
fragment tl without weak negation implication operator classical logic
tl thus logical blend rather crossbreed
peña's plan investigate grounds logical system nonclassical combinatory logic thus far remained programmatic combinatory account fits metaphysical approach
cumulativism cumulativism peña's philosophical orientation developed 1996 onwards
cumulativism contradictorial gradualism added emphasis six hitherto partly implicit components approach transitions either continuous least supervene underlying continuous mutations going through successive steps hence change slow implies succession stages each keeps many qualities previous stage
2 transitions either aggregations disaggregations processes sedimentation erosion since cumulation gathering reality's most prominent feature ontophantics already conceived entities sets now principle togetherness made mainstay philosophical system
3 metaphysical isolationism avoided espousing collectivism both metaphysics political philosophy
4 programme conceptual flexibilization proposed concepts become soft fluid shifting borders
5 gatherings clusters approach advances called cumuli cumulations—so mistaken sets sense standard set-theory—the main idea remaining things congregated cluster necessarily share cluster's defining charasterictic generally meinongian description principle fails namely entity thus-and-so indeed thus-and-so
6 compendium cumulativism taken philosophy conjunction a-and-b conjunctive state affairs exists extent exist
a-and-b's own properties supervene those held
nomological logic peña's work deontic logic began short after 1979 ph
first paper published issue appeared 1988
time essentially clung von wright's standard approach departing introducing degrees admitting normative contradictions antinomies
soon became dissatisfied scheme proved incompatible serious applications deontic logic practice legal reasoning
found out flaw think deontic logic species genus modal logic stressing similarities duty necessity licitness possibility
underlying mistake according peña wrong metaphysical assumption denies existence deontic states affairs connected implications
denial pushes deontic logicians conceive deontic logic logic duty-compliances
thus necessarily implies standard deontic logic believes duty implies duty b—this rule logical closure
rule first dogmas waived peña's deontic approach
peña thus prompted produce new system deontic logic nomological logic nl also called 'juristic logic' combining number particularities make unique standard deontic principles relinquished except bentham's law namely obligatory also licit
precisely two following rules abandoned logical closure usual distribution rules obligatoriness a-and-b implies obligatoriness conversely
deontic detachment embraced licit either fact happens realized then licit same applies obligatoriness
restrictions needed order avoid paradoxes
principle co-licitness espoused namely extent licit a-and-b licit too
new deontic principles introduced resorting two non-standard operators hindering causation causal effects licit causes licit thwarting licit behaviour forbidden
non-standard rule liberty added prohibition cannot proved then must taken licit
degrees licitness obligation accounted apposite axioms involving implication particular proportionality axiom introduced linking degrees realization factual antecedent degrees licitness obligatoriness normative consequence
peña claims valid principles logic general deontic logic particular found induction rather abduction through circular holistic process
studying normative reasoning really happens legal practice sanitized sets axioms inference rules devised then subject acid test applicability
pluralistic axiology peña proposed pluralistic axiology order deal debate deontological consequentialist approaches ethics
peña classifies ethical theories two groups internalism externalism former valuing conducts according intrinsic features
externalism comes two ways antecedentalism consequentialism
there two sorts consequentialism monistic pluralistic former maintaining there ethical property practical consequences actions must order render action ethically valuable
utilitarianism monist consequentialism
peña pluralist
inclined pluralistic consequentialism approach taken transcend very dichotomy since once no unique criterion looked actions ought assessed number ways according different values necessarily teleological
since approach gradualistic ethical valuations taken scales infinitely many degrees combined infinitely complex compositions
withal nearer causal consequence our action higher ethical significance
peña implements ethical pluralistic gradualism through paraconsistent fuzzy logic actions regarded both good bad better certain respects worse other respects
units behaviour assessed peña's ideas close virtue ethics thinks isolated actions generally too narrow unities reasonably appraised although whole course life too broad
something in-between adequate candidate means span one's life evincing continuation purposes choices habits
peña admits pluralistic axiology faces serious difficulty namely provides no clear guidance action unless there objective all-things-considered perspective
claims sometimes there no such perspective those cases choices justified one's previous allegiance prevalence certain values
even all-things-considered outlook warranted existence does mean contradictory valuations merely prima facie
thus ethical contradictions cannot evaded
social evolutionism against claim progress vapid concept there no continuous improvement along history peña's philosophy history argues progress necessary outcome our cultural rationality—weak partial though is—thanks any human society will tend ameliorate welfare blending scattered wisdom members combined collective purposive intelligence thus increasing little little social accumulation material intellectual assets establishing workable reliable socially acceptable laws making distribution practices consonant public interest
human progress being continuous no historic leaps possible there no objective ground any periodization
any delimitation epochs matter mere convenience
law human progress assimilated grand schemes postulating predetermined succession ages such those stoics vico hegel
comte k
peña's philosophy history shares those forerunners view human history universal both backwards forwards
there common ancestry entails least few elements disparate human traditions go back our shared origin
those elements time again strengthened mutual borrowing concepts techniques institutions procedures
there also common destination owing our shared planet converging tendency needs no mysterious invisible hand results objective constraints
peña's philosophy history acknowledges collective minds supervene individual minds
no society exist without common memory common plans living-together reaching common aims does mean members body politic share those feelings peña rejects any mandatory imposition beliefs values
peña does deny existence historic breaks caused social involutions disasters wars foreign subjugations natural catastrophes thinks every human society finds way restart ascending march
peña maintains future-oriented improvement sense human life both individual collective much fundamental right man right better life—as far possible
general right encompasses particular welfare rights such rights food work dwelling mobility ought considered dynamically
republican republicanism peña's legal philosophy natural-law theory deriving aquinas's conception law ordinance reason common good
those ordinances promulgated legislators means certain speech acts others natural-law norms stem very nature social relations
against social-covenant views peña regards human beings naturally social antecedently banded together community under established authority whose duty pursue public interest
peña claims inhabitants land enter quasi-contract growing up within society benefiting established social institutions thus committing themselves contribute common good subordinate their particular interests those society whole needs such people worse-off
main claims social philosophy advances rejection dichotomy state civil society contrived duality blames root serious misconceptions
primeval meaning «republic» being state «republicanism» primarily means giving prominence public mission vested state promoting favouring government's intervention domain resources publicly managed—provided such state no hereditary ruler
peña coined pleonastic phrase «republican republicanism» alternative wording «public republicanism» designate political ideas according state's job pursue common welfare organizing public services
peña claims there never minimal state concerned keeping law order nothing else
contrary states undertaken broad range productive activities without no private enterprise workable
republican republicanism thus political philosophy tending increase scope activities entrusted state setting up planned economy powerful public sector gradual socialization property meanwhile private ownership fraught legal burdens common good
doctrine borrows number ideas traditions british fabian society french solidarism german chair-socialism well spanish school krausist philosophers lawyers inspired ii republic 1931–1939 whose constitution takes paradigm
peña's republicanism implies rejection forms market economy including market socialism
contends state's patronage intervention alone bring sense directedness unity purpose failing practicable way mercantile competition dreary ruthless consequences
according peña republican republicanism differs four ways civic neo-republicanism civicism
thing rejects monarchy while civicism concerned over political form government
another statist while civicists main agree libertarians liberals viewing public arena neutral ground within private endeavours undertakings pursued citizens companies other private clubs
third civicism promotes such private virtues foster participation public institutions whereas peña's republicanism recognizes right individuals concerned public issues
fourth civicism professes value freedom understood non-domination while already seen peña espouses plurality values thriving welfare akin martha nussbaum's flourishing love liberty rationality brotherhood equality living-together owing normative axiological contradictions unavoidable
dealing those contradictions needs weighing proportion contradictorial gradualism bears out proposal
essential component peña's republicanism proposal earthian republic
peña views regional blocks splits human family bringing enmities conflicts interest rather fraternal union champions ground both prudential axiological considerations
