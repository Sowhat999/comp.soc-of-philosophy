father taught russian language literature high school mother taught geography history school girls
addition russian gamow learned speak french mother german tutor
gamow learned fluent english college years later
most early publications german russian later switched writing english both technical papers lay audience
educated novorossiya university odessa 1922–23 university leningrad 1923–1929
gamow studied under alexander friedmann time leningrad until friedmann's early death 1925
aspired doctoral thesis under friedmann change dissertation advisors
university gamow made friends three other students theoretical physics lev landau dmitri ivanenko matvey bronshtein later arrested 1937 executed 1938 soviet regime
four formed group known three musketeers met discuss analyze ground-breaking papers quantum mechanics published during those years
later used same phrase describe alpher herman gamow group
graduation worked quantum theory göttingen research atomic nucleus provided basis doctorate
then worked theoretical physics institute university copenhagen 1928 1931 break work ernest rutherford cavendish laboratory cambridge
continued study atomic nucleus proposing liquid drop model also worked stellar physics robert atkinson fritz houtermans
1931 gamow elected corresponding member academy sciences ussr age 28 youngest history organization
during period 1931–1933 george gamow worked physical department radium institute leningrad headed vitaly khlopin ru
under guidance direct participation igor kurchatov lev mysovskii george gamow europe's first cyclotron designed
1932 george gamow lev mysovskii submitted draft design consideration academic council radium institute approved
cyclotron completed until 1937

gamow rightmost radioactive decay early 20 th century radioactive materials known characteristic exponential decay rates half lives
same time radiation emissions known certain characteristic energies
1928 gamow solved theory alpha decay nucleus via tunnelling mathematical help nikolai kochin
problem also solved independently ronald w
gurney edward u
gurney condon however achieve quantitative results achieved gamow
classically particle confined nucleus because high energy requirement escape very strong nuclear potential well
also classically takes enormous amount energy pull apart nucleus event occur spontaneously
quantum mechanics however there probability particle tunnel through wall potential well escape
gamow solved model potential nucleus derived first principles relationship half-life alpha-decay event process energy emission previously discovered empirically known geiger–nuttall law
years later name gamow factor gamow–sommerfeld factor applied probability incoming nuclear particles tunneling through electrostatic coulomb barrier undergoing nuclear reactions
defection gamow worked number soviet establishments before deciding flee soviet union because increased oppression
1931 officially denied permission attend scientific conference italy
also 1931 married lyubov vokhmintseva russian любовь вохминцева another physicist soviet union whom nicknamed rho after greek letter
gamow new wife spent much next two years trying leave soviet union without official permission
niels bohr other friends invited gamow visit during period gamow get permission leave
gamow later claimed first two attempts defect wife 1932 involved trying kayak first planned 250-kilometer paddle over black sea turkey another attempt murmansk norway
poor weather foiled both attempts noticed authorities
1933 gamow suddenly granted permission attend 7 th solvay conference physics brussels
insisted having wife accompany even saying go alone
eventually soviet authorities relented issued passports couple
two attended arranged extend their stay help marie curie other physicists
over next year gamow obtained temporary work curie institute university london university michigan
move america 1934 gamow wife moved united states
became professor george washington university gwu 1934 recruited physicist edward teller london join gwu
1936 gamow teller published became known gamow–teller selection rule beta decay
during time washington gamow also publish major scientific papers mário schoenberg ralph alpher
late 1930 s gamow's interests turned towards astrophysics cosmology
1935 gamow's son igor gamow born
george gamow became naturalized american 1940
retained formal association gwu until 1956
during world war ii gamow work directly manhattan project producing atomic bomb spite knowledge radioactivity nuclear fusion
continued teach physics gwu consulted us navy
gamow interested processes stellar evolution early history solar system
1945 co-authored paper supporting work german theoretical physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker planetary formation early solar system
gamow published another paper british journal nature 1948 developed equations mass radius primordial galaxy typically contains hundred billion stars each mass comparable sun
[citation needed] big bang nucleosynthesis george gamow father hot big bang theory expanding universe
earliest employ alexander friedmann's georges lemaître's non-static solutions einstein's gravitational equations describing universe uniform matter density constant spatial curvature
gamow's crucial advance provide physical reification lemaître's idea unique primordial quantum
gamow assuming early universe hot
dominated radiation rather matter
most later work cosmology founded gamow's theory
applied model question creation chemical elements subsequent condensation matter galaxies whose mass diameter able calculate terms fundamental physical parameters such speed light c newton's gravitational constant g sommerfeld's fine-structure constant α planck's constant h
gamow's interest cosmology arose earlier interest energy generation element production transformation stars work turn evolved fundamental discovery mechanism nuclear alpha decay quantum tunneling application theory inverse process calculate rates thermonuclear reaction
first gamow believed elements might produced very high temperature density early stage universe
later revised opinion strength compelling evidence advanced hoyle et al
elements heavier lithium largely produced thermonuclear reactions stars supernovae
gamow formulated set coupled differential equations describing proposed process assigned ph
dissertation topic graduate student ralph alpher task solving equations numerically
these results gamow alpher appeared 1948 co-authored hans bethe notorious αβγ paper
bethe later referred paper being wrong presumably because authors failed take account helium nucleus' exiguous cross-section reaction other nucleotides — effectively halting primordial process element
before interest turned question genetic code gamow published twenty papers cosmology
earliest 1939 galaxy formation edward teller followed 1946 first description cosmic nucleosynthesis
also many popular semi-popular articles well academic textbooks dealt contributions subject
three papers particular interest
first these dealt attenuated version coupled set equations describing production proton deuteron thermal neutrons
characteristically ingenious simplification using observed ratio hydrogen heavier elements able obtain density matter onset nucleosynthesis mass diameter early galaxies
second paper produced similar results time based another ingenious determination density matter radiation point became equal
paper gamow determined density relict background radiation present temperature 7 k trivially predicted little twice presently accepted value
last paper interest essentially reminder recapitulation work gamow well alpher robert herman both gamow also independently prompted discovery cosmic background radiation penzias wilson 1965 gamow alpher herman time receive credit deserved their prediction existence source
today injustice largely redressed
dna rna after discovery structure dna 1953 francis crick james
watson maurice wilkins rosalind franklin gamow attempted solve problem how order four different kinds bases adenine cytosine thymine guanine dna chains control synthesis proteins amino acids
crick gamow's suggestions helped own thinking problem
related crick gamow suggested twenty combinations four dna bases taken three time corresponded twenty amino acids form proteins
led crick watson enumerate twenty amino acids common proteins
gamow's contribution solving problem genetic coding gave rise important models biological degeneracy
specific system proposed gamow known gamow's diamonds incorrect triplets supposed overlapping sequence ggac example gga produce amino acid gac another non-degenerate meaning each amino acid correspond combination three bases any order
later protein sequencing work proved case true genetic code non-overlapping degenerate changing order combination bases does change amino acid
1954 gamow watson co-founded rna tie club discussion group leading scientists concerned problem genetic code
own autobiographical writings watson later acknowledged gamow's ideas colorful personality zany card–trick playing limerick–singing booze–swilling practical–joking giant imp”
late career life grave george gamow green mountain cemetery boulder colorado usa gamow worked george washington university 1934 until 1954 became visiting professor university california berkeley
1956 moved university colorado boulder remained rest career
1956 gamow became founding members physical science study committee pssc later reformed teaching high school physics post-sputnik years

george gamow tower university colorado boulder writings gamow highly successful science writer several books still print half-century after their initial publication
educator gamow recognized emphasized fundamental principles unlikely become obsolete even pace science technology accelerated
also conveyed sense excitement revolution physics other scientific topics interest common reader
