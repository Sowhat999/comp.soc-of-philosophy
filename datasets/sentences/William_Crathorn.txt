epistemology crathorn's philosophy focuses mainly upon epistemology problem knowledge
thoughts knowledge resemble closely those roger bacon held knowledge external world comes recognition different species objects
species perceived both cause likeness eye perceiver
crathorn asserts somewhat kantian view no direct access things external world immediately perceive their mental likenesses representations their species
crathorn believed since concepts belong category quality must mental qualities having same nature non-mental qualities must exist subjectively mind say exist part brain
illuminate theory offered theories explaining brain function how such relates philosophy knowledge
crathorn affirms whenever contemplating certain concept mind person thinking actually mirrors concept
thought mental concepts cannot resemble substances qualities substances because species substance substance itself our minds turn new substance thought
also cannot pure quantity because thinking infinite magnitudes our minds become infinite same true other categories besides quality
crathorn held one's ability conceptualize therefore limited natural concepts qualities being conceived become qualities soul
crathorn also looked skeptical challenges anticipated problem knowledge
refute skeptical claims turned back cogito-argument prove least certain our own mental activity doubt proposition such ‘i am’ follow exists since does exist does doubt
philosophy language like much philosophical discussion during time england crathorn considered linguistic aspects science
questioned whether know something scientifically knowledge external things propositions other complex thing
believed crathorn popularized notion neither external aspect proposition proper object science total significance proposition most important
also discussed nature mental language namely whether conventional natural
crathorn's predecessors argued thinking occurs universal language concepts acquired causally via experience conventional languages subordinated mental language shared everyone priori fashion
crathorn accept such position because view qualities natural signs their extra-mental significates
crathorn argued except natural signs qualities mental language conventional because derived conventional language
hence whatever language speaks head modeled language used external communication
crathorn revolutionary time affirm words prior ideas ideas shaped words
ontology crathorn differed standard system aristotle categories
crathorn felt entire system revised human mind naturally knows qualities cannot certain even exist without appealing principle god deceive us
thinking reasoning no help because purely conventional
example category substance distinguished other categories fact no contrary successively acquire contrary qualities
thus there no non-substances though substance black then white succession cold then gradually hot
crathorn claims heat object substance also qualities become hot such qualities change state their contrary exactly like substance
