de nova stella new star 1573 refuted aristotelian belief unchanging celestial realm
precise measurements indicated new stars stellae novae now known supernovae particular 1572 lacked parallax expected sublunar phenomena therefore tailless comets atmosphere previously believed above atmosphere beyond moon
using similar measurements showed comets also atmospheric phenomena previously thought must pass through supposedly immutable celestial spheres

otte brahe tycho's father nobleman important figure court danish king
mother beate bille came important family produced leading churchmen politicians
both parents buried under floor kågeröd church four kilometres east knutstorp
epitaph originally knutstorp now plaque near church door shows whole family including tycho boy
tycho later around age two uncle danish nobleman jørgen thygesen brahe without knowledge my parents took me away while my earliest youth become scholar
apparently lead dispute nor parents attempt get back
according source tycho's parents promised hand over boy child jørgen wife childless honoured promise
jørgen seems taken matters own hands took child away own residence tosterup castle
tycho attended latin school ages 6 12 name school known
also thought may taught private tutor these ages
age 12 19 april 1559 tycho began studies university copenhagen
there following uncle's wishes studied law also studied variety other subjects became interested astronomy
solar eclipse 21 august 1560 especially fact predicted impressed began make own studies astronomy helped professors
purchased ephemeris books astronomy including johannes de sacrobosco's de sphaera mundi petrus apianus's cosmographia seu descriptio totius orbis regiomontanus's de triangulis omnimodis
jørgen thygesen brahe however wanted tycho educate himself order become civil servant sent study tour europe early 1562
tycho given 19-year-old anders sørensen vedel mentor whom eventually talked allowing pursuit astronomy during tour
vedel pupil left copenhagen february 1562 arrived leipzig march 24 matriculated leipzig university
leipzig brahe obliged study astronomy secret
tycho realized progress astronomy required systematic rigorous observation night after night using most accurate instruments obtainable
program became life's work
tycho improved enlarged existing instruments built entirely new ones
sister sophia assisted tycho many measurements
tycho last major astronomer work without aid telescope soon turned skyward galileo others
tycho jealously guarded large body celestial measurements kepler took under care following tycho's death
tycho's nose artificial nose kind tycho wore
particular example belong tycho
while studying university rostock germany 29 december 1566 tycho lost part nose sword duel against fellow danish nobleman third cousin manderup parsberg
tycho earlier quarrelled parsberg over legitimacy mathematical formula wedding dance professor lucas bachmeister's house 10 th again 27 th
since neither resources prove other wrong ended up resolving issue duel
though two later reconciled duel two days later dark resulted tycho losing bridge nose
event tycho became interested medicine alchemy
rest life worn replacement made silver gold using paste glue keep attached
people such fredric ihren cecil adams suggested false nose also contained copper
ihren tycho's tomb opened 24 june 1901 green marks found skull suggesting copper
cecil adams also mentions green coloring medical experts examined remains
historians speculated wore different prosthetics different occasions noting copper nose comfortable less heavy made precious metal
nonetheless november danish czech researchers after chemically analyzing small bone sample nose body exhumed 2010 reported prosthetic made out brass
death uncle uncle foster father jørgen brahe died 1565 pneumonia after rescuing frederick ii denmark drowning
april 1567 tycho returned home travels
father wanted take up law tycho allowed make trips rostock then augsburg built great quadrant basel freiburg
end 1570 informed father's ill health returned knutstorp castle father died 9 may 1571
soon after another uncle steen bille helped build observatory alchemical laboratory herrevad abbey
family life towards end 1571 tycho fell love kirsten daughter jørgen hansen lutheran minister knudstrup
she commoner tycho never formally married her
however under danish law nobleman common woman lived together openly husband wife she wore keys household her belt like any true wife their alliance became binding morganatic marriage after three years
husband retained noble status privileges wife remained commoner
their children legitimate eyes law commoners like their mother inherit their father's name coat arms landholdings
kirsten tycho's children later testified legitimate tycho's younger sister sophie
kirsten jørgensdatter gave birth their first daughter kirstine named after tycho's late sister died 13 12 october 1573
together eight children six whom lived adulthood
1574 moved copenhagen their daughter magdalene born
kirsten tycho lived together almost thirty years until tycho's death
tycho's elk tycho said[by whom?] own percent entire wealth denmark point 1580 s
[better source needed] tycho often held large social gatherings castle
pierre gassendi tycho also tame elk moose mentor landgrave wilhelm hesse-kassel hesse-cassel asked whether there animal faster deer
tycho replied writing there none send tame elk
wilhelm replied accept exchange horse tycho replied sad news elk just died visit entertain nobleman landskrona
apparently during dinner elk drunk lot beer fallen down stairs died
death tycho brahe's grave prague new tomb stone 1901 tycho suddenly contracted bladder kidney ailment after attending banquet prague died eleven days later 24 october 1601 age 54
according kepler's first hand account tycho refused leave banquet relieve himself because breach etiquette
after returned home no longer able urinate except eventually very small quantities excruciating pain
night before died suffered delirium during frequently heard exclaim hoped seem lived vain
before dying urged kepler finish rudolphine tables expressed hope adopting tycho's own planetary system rather copernicus
reported brahe written own epitaph lived like sage died like fool
contemporary physician attributed death kidney stone no kidney stones found during autopsy performed after body exhumed 1901 20 th-century medical assessment likely resulted uremia
1990 s' investigations suggested tycho die urinary problems instead mercury poisoning
speculated intentionally poisoned
two main suspects assistant johannes kepler whose motives gain access brahe's laboratory chemicals cousin erik brahe order friend-turned-enemy christian iv due rumors time tycho affair christian's mother
however february 2010 prague city hall approved request danish scientists exhume remains november 2010 group czech danish scientists aarhus university collected bone hair clothing samples analysis
scientists led dr jens vellev analyzed tycho's beard hair once again
team reported november there enough mercury present substantiate murder there no lethal levels any poisons present
team's conclusions impossible tycho brahe murdered most likely died burst bladder
findings confirmed scientists university rostock examined sample brahe's beard hairs taken 1901
although traces mercury found these present outer scales
therefore mercury poisoning cause death ruled out while study suggests accumulation mercury may come precipitation mercury dust air during [brahe's] long-term alchemistic activities

career observing heavens 1572 supernova star map constellation cassiopeia showing position supernova 1572 topmost star labelled tycho brahe's de nova stella november 1572 tycho observed herrevad abbey very bright star now named sn 1572 unexpectedly appeared constellation cassiopeia
because maintained since antiquity world beyond moon's orbit eternally unchangeable celestial immutability fundamental axiom aristotelian world-view other observers held phenomenon something terrestrial sphere below moon
however first instance tycho observed object showed no daily parallax against background fixed stars
implied least farther away moon those planets show such parallax
also found object change position relative fixed stars over several months planets their periodic orbital motions even outer planets no daily parallax detectable
suggested even planet fixed star stellar sphere beyond planets
1573 published small book de nova stella thereby coining term nova new star now classify star supernova know 7500 light-years earth
discovery decisive choice astronomy profession
tycho strongly critical those dismissed implications astronomical appearance writing preface de nova stella o crassa ingenia

tycho's observatories watercolor plan uraniborg 1574 tycho published observations made 1572 first observatory herrevad abbey
then started lecturing astronomy gave up left denmark spring 1575 tour abroad
first visited william iv landgrave hesse-kassel's observatory kassel then went frankfurt basel venice
upon return intended relocate basel king frederick ii denmark desiring keep distinguished scientist offered tycho island hven oresund funding set up observatory
tycho built observatory uraniborg hven 1576 laboratory alchemical experiments cellar then stjerneborg nearby 1581
unusual time tycho established uraniborg research centre almost 100 students artisans worked 1576 1597
after frederick died 1588 11-year-old son christian iv succeeded tycho's influence steadily declined
after several unpleasant disagreements tycho left hven 1597
instruments used uraniborg stjerneborg depicted described detail book astronomiae instauratae mechanica first published 1598
moved prague 1599
sponsored rudolf ii holy roman emperor tycho built new observatory castle benátky nad jizerou 50 km prague worked there year
emperor then brought back prague stayed until death
tycho received financial support several nobles addition emperor including oldrich desiderius pruskowsky von pruskow whom dedicated famous mechanica
return their support tycho's duties included preparing astrological charts predictions patrons events such births weather forecasting astrological interpretations significant astronomical events such supernova 1572 sometimes called tycho's supernova great comet 1577
introduction new astronomy 1588 year 1588 saw death royal benefactor saw also publication volume tycho's great work astronomiæ instauratæ progymnasmata introduction new astronomy
first volume devoted new star 1572 ready because reduction observations 1572-3 involved much research correct star places refraction precession motion sun etc
completed tycho's lifetime second volume devoted comet 1577 printed uraniborg copies issued 1588
besides comet observations included account tycho's system world
third volume treat comets 1580 following years similar manner never published nor even written though great deal material comet 1585 put together first published 1845 observations comet
tycho's observational astronomy mural quadrant tycho brahe 1598 tycho's observations stellar planetary positions noteworthy both their accuracy quantity
celestial positions much accurate those any predecessor contemporary
rawlins 1993 §b2 asserts tycho's star catalog tycho achieved mass scale precision far beyond earlier catalogers
cat represents unprecedented confluence skills instrumental observational & computational—all combined enable tycho place most hundreds recorded stars accuracy ordermag 1'! aspired level accuracy estimated positions celestial bodies being consistently within arcminute their real celestial locations also claimed achieved level
fact many stellar positions star catalogues less accurate
median errors stellar positions final published catalog 1'
5 indicating half entries accurate overall mean error each coordinate around 2'
although stellar observations recorded observational logs accurate varying
3 48
different instruments systematic errors much 3' introduced stellar positions tycho published star catalog - due instance application erroneous ancient value parallax neglect polestar refraction
incorrect transcription final published star catalogue scribes brahe's employ source even larger errors sometimes many degrees
after tycho's death kepler used records motion mars deduce own laws planetary motion
kepler's application these two laws obtain astronomical tables unprecedented accuracy rudolphine tables provided powerful support heliocentric model solar system
celestial objects observed near horizon above appear greater altitude real due atmospheric refraction tycho's most important innovations worked out published very first tables systematic correction possible source error
advanced attributed no refraction whatever above degrees altitude solar refraction none starlight above 20 degrees altitude
perform huge number multiplications needed produce much astronomical data tycho relied heavily then-new technique prosthaphaeresis algorithm approximating products based trigonometric identities predated logarithms
tycho's geo-heliocentric astronomy main article tychonic system depiction tychonic system objects blue orbits moon sun revolve around earth
objects orange orbits mercury venus mars jupiter saturn revolve around sun
around sphere fixed stars
valentin naboth's drawing martianus capella's geo-heliocentric astronomical model 1573 tycho copernican proposed geo-heliocentric system sun moon orbited earth while other planets orbited sun
system provided safe position astronomers dissatisfied older models reluctant accept earth's motion
gained considerable following after 1616 rome decided officially heliocentric model contrary both philosophy scripture discussed computational convenience no connection fact
system also offered major innovation while both purely geocentric model heliocentric model set forth copernicus relied idea transparent rotating crystalline spheres carry planets their orbits tycho eliminated spheres entirely
kepler tried unable persuade tycho adopt heliocentric model solar system
tycho advocated system immobile earth both scientific religious reasons
according tycho idea rotating revolving earth violation physical truth also authority holy scripture ought paramount
respect physics tycho held earth just too sluggish heavy continuously motion
according accepted aristotelian physics time heavens whose motions cycles continuous unending made aether quintessence substance found earth light strong unchanging natural state circular motion
contrast earth objects seem motion moved things composed substances heavy whose natural state rest
accordingly tycho earth lazy body readily moved
thus while tycho acknowledged daily rising setting sun stars explained earth's rotation copernicus still such fast motion belong earth body very heavy dense opaque rather belongs sky itself whose form subtle constant matter better suited perpetual motion however fast
respect stars tycho also believed earth orbited sun annually there should observable stellar parallax over any period six months during angular orientation given star change thanks earth's changing position
parallax does exist small detected until 1838 friedrich bessel discovered parallax 0
314 arcseconds star 61 cygni
copernican explanation lack parallax stars such great distance earth earth's orbit almost insignificant comparison
however tycho noted explanation introduced another problem stars seen naked eye appear small size prominent stars such vega appearing larger lesser stars such polaris turn appear larger many others
tycho determined typical star measured approximately minute arc size prominent ones being two three times large
writing christoph rothmann copernican astronomer tycho used basic geometry show assuming small parallax just escaped detection distance stars copernican system 700 times greater distance sun saturn
moreover way stars distant still appear sizes sky even average stars gigantic — least big orbit earth course vastly larger sun
tycho prominent stars even larger still
parallax even smaller anyone thought stars yet distant? then even larger still
tycho deduce these things geometrically you like you will see how many absurdities mention others accompany assumption [of motion earth] inference
copernicans offered religious response tycho's geometry titanic distant stars might seem unreasonable creator make creations large wanted
fact rothmann responded argument tycho's saying [w]hat absurd [an average star] having size equal whole [orbit earth]? contrary divine will impossible divine nature inadmissible infinite nature? these things must entirely demonstrated you you will wish infer here anything absurd
these things vulgar sorts see absurd first glance easily charged absurdity fact divine sapience majesty far greater understand
grant vastness universe sizes stars great you like — these will still bear no proportion infinite creator
reckons greater king much greater larger palace befitting majesty
how great palace you reckon fitting god?
religion played role tycho's geocentrism also cited authority scripture portraying earth being rest
rarely used biblical arguments alone secondary objection idea earth's motion over time came focus scientific arguments take biblical arguments seriously
tycho advocated alternative ptolemaic geocentric system geo-heliocentric system now known tychonic system developed late 1570 s
such system sun moon stars circle central earth while five planets orbit sun
essential difference heavens including planets earth remained motion stayed aethereal heavens immobility stayed heavy sluggish earth
system tycho violated neither laws physics nor sacred scripture — stars located just beyond saturn reasonable size
tycho first propose geoheliocentric system
used thought heraclides 4 th century bc suggested mercury venus revolve around sun turn along other planets revolves around earth
macrobius ambrosius theodosius 395–423 ad later described egyptian system stating escape skill egyptians though there no other evidence known ancient egypt
difference tycho's system planets exception earth revolving around sun instead just interior planets mercury venus
regard anticipated 15 th century kerala school astronomer nilakantha somayaji whose geoheliocentric system also planets revolving around sun
difference both these systems tycho's model earth does rotate daily heraclides nilakantha claimed static
another crucial difference tycho's 1587 geo-heliocentric model those other geo-heliocentric astronomers such paul wittich reimarus ursus helisaeus roeslin david origanus orbits mars sun intersected
because tycho come believe distance mars earth opposition mars opposite side sky sun less sun earth
tycho believed because came believe mars greater daily parallax sun
1584 letter fellow astronomer brucaeus claimed mars further sun opposition 1582 because observed mars little no daily parallax
therefore rejected copernicus's model because predicted mars two-thirds distance sun
apparently later changed mind opinion mars opposition indeed nearer earth sun apparently without any valid observational evidence any discernible martian parallax
such intersecting martian solar orbits meant there no solid rotating celestial spheres because possibly interpenetrate
arguably conclusion independently supported conclusion comet 1577 superlunary because showed less daily parallax moon thus must pass through any celestial spheres transit
tychonic astronomy after tycho galileo's 1610 telescopic discovery venus shows full set phases refuted pure geocentric ptolemaic model
after seems 17 th century astronomy mostly converted geo-heliocentric planetary models explain these phases just well heliocentric model without latter's disadvantage failure detect any annual stellar parallax tycho others regarded refuting
three main geo-heliocentric models tychonic capellan just mercury venus orbiting sun such favoured francis bacon example extended capellan model riccioli mars also orbiting sun whilst saturn jupiter orbit fixed earth
tychonic model probably most popular albeit probably known 'the semi-tychonic' version daily rotating earth
model advocated tycho's ex-assistant disciple longomontanus 1622 astronomia danica intended completion tycho's planetary model observational data regarded canonical statement complete tychonic planetary system
conversion astronomers geo-rotational geo-heliocentric models daily rotating earth such longomontanus may precipitated francesco sizzi's 1613 discovery annually periodic seasonal variations sunspot trajectories across sun's disc
appear oscillate above below apparent equator over course four seasons
seasonal variation explained much better hypothesis daily rotating earth together sun's axis being tilted throughout supposed annual orbit daily orbiting sun even refuting latter hypothesis because predicts daily vertical oscillation sunspot's position contrary observation
discovery import heliocentrism geo-heliocentrism discussed third day galileo's 1632 dialogo
however prior discovery late 16 th century geo-heliocentric models ursus roslin featured daily rotating earth unlike tycho's geo-static model indeed heraclides antiquity whatever reason
fact longomontanus's book republished two later editions 1640 1663 no doubt reflected popularity tychonic astronomy 17 th century
adherents included john donne atomist astronomer pierre gassendi
johannes kepler published rudolphine tables containing star catalog planetary tables using tycho's measurements
hven island appears west uppermost base
ardent anti-heliocentric french astronomer jean-baptiste morin devised tychonic planetary model elliptical orbits published 1650 simplified tychonic version rudolphine tables
acceptance tychonic system persisted through 17 th century places until early 18 th century supported after 1633 decree copernican controversy flood pro-tycho literature jesuit origin
among pro-tycho jesuits ignace pardies declared 1691 still commonly accepted system francesco blanchinus reiterated late 1728
persistence tychonic system especially catholic countries attributed satisfaction need relative catholic doctrine safe synthesis ancient modern
after 1670 even many jesuit writers thinly disguised their copernicanism
germany netherlands england tychonic system vanished literature much earlier
james bradley's discovery stellar aberration published 1729 eventually gave direct evidence excluding possibility forms geocentrism including tycho's
stellar aberration satisfactorily explained basis earth annual orbit around sun orbital velocity combines finite speed light coming observed star planet affect apparent direction body observed
tycho's lunar theory tycho's distinctive contributions lunar theory include discovery variation moon's longitude
represents largest inequality longitude after equation center evection
also discovered librations inclination plane lunar orbit relative ecliptic constant 5° believed before fluctuates through range over quarter degree accompanying oscillations longitude lunar node
these represent perturbations moon's ecliptic latitude
tycho's lunar theory doubled number distinct lunar inequalities relative those anciently known reduced discrepancies lunar theory 1/5 their previous amounts
published posthumously kepler 1602 kepler's own derivative form appears kepler's rudolphine tables 1627
legacy monument tycho brahe johannes kepler prague although tycho's planetary model soon discredited astronomical observations essential contribution scientific revolution
traditional view tycho primarily empiricist set new standards precise objective measurements
appraisal originated pierre gassendi's 1654 biography tychonis brahe equitis dani astronomorum coryphaei vita
furthered johann dreyer's biography 1890[citation needed] long most influential work tycho
