evolution early 1930 s waddington many other embryologists looked molecules induce amphibian neural tube
search beyond technology time most embryologists moved away such deep problems
waddington however came view answers embryology lay genetics 1935 went thomas hunt morgan's drosophila laboratory california even though time most embryologists felt genes unimportant just played role minor phenomena such eye colour
late 1930 s waddington produced formal models how gene regulatory products generate developmental phenomena showed how mechanisms underpinning drosophila development studied through systematic analysis mutations affected development drosophila wing essence approach won 1995 nobel prize medicine christiane nüsslein-volhard eric f
period great creativity end 1930 s also discovered mutations affected cell phenotypes first textbook developmental epigenetics term then meant external manifestation genetic activity
waddington also coined other essential concepts such canalisation refers ability organism produce same phenotype despite variation genotype environment
also identified mechanism called genetic assimilation allow animal’s response environmental stress become fixed part developmental repertoire then went show mechanism work
1972 waddington founded centre human ecology
epigenetic landscape waddington's epigenetic landscape metaphor how gene regulation modulates development
among other metaphors waddington asks us imagine number marbles rolling down hill
marbles will compete grooves slope come rest lowest points
these points represent eventual cell fates tissue types
waddington coined term chreode represent cellular developmental process
idea actually based experiment waddington found effect mutation modulate epigenetic landscape affect how cells differentiated
also showed how mutation affect landscape used metaphor discussions evolution—he first person emphasise evolution mainly occurred through mutations affected developmental anatomy
genetic assimilation waddington proposed evolutionary process genetic assimilation darwinian mechanism allows certain acquired characteristic become heritable
according navis 2007 waddington focused genetic assimilation work crossveinless trait drosophila
trait occurs high frequency heat-treated flies
after few generations trait found population without application heat based hidden genetic variation “assimilated
genetic assimilation sometimes cited lamarckian mechanism however waddington described mechanism darwinian lamarckian
biologist wallace arthur genetic assimilation looks lamarckian
special case evolution phenotypic plasticity
neo-darwinism waddington usually cited darwinian non-darwinian
however neo-darwinian modern synthesis theorists described waddington non-darwinian claimed different processes those microevolution drive macroevolution
according wilkins 2009 [waddington] lifetime
widely perceived primarily critic neo-darwinian evolutionary theory
criticisms neo-darwinian evolutionary theory focused saw unrealistic “atomistic” models both gene selection trait evolution
particular felt neo-darwinians badly neglected phenomenon extensive gene interactions “randomness” mutational effects posited theory false postulate
even though waddington became critical neo-darwinian synthetic theory evolution still described himself darwinian work attempted correct expand neo-darwinism replace
called extended evolutionary synthesis based research epigenetics genetic assimilation
waddington organiser waddington very active advancing biology discipline
contributed book role sciences times war helped set up several professional bodies representing biology discipline
remarkable number contemporary colleagues edinburgh became fellows royal society during time there shortly thereafter
waddington old-fashioned intellectual lived both arts science milieus 1950 s widely
1960 book behind appearance study relations painting natural sciences century mit press wonderful pictures still worth reading
waddington without doubt most original important thinker developmental biology pre-molecular age medal british society developmental biology named after
