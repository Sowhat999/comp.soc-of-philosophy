yūnus qūnawī persian صدر الدین قونوی‎‎ 1207-74 ce/605-73 ah [alternatively qūnavī qūnyawī] most influential thinkers mystical sufi philosophy
played pivotal role study knowledge—or epistemology context referred specifically theoretical elaboration mystical/intellectual insight
combined highly original mystic-thinker muḥyī al-dīn ibn 'arabī 1165-1240 ce/560-638 ah whose arcane teachings qūnavī codified helped incorporate burgeoning pre-ottoman intellectual tradition hand logical/philosophical innovations ibn sīnā lat

philosophical knowledge 3 problem knowledge 4 intellectual environment 5 mystical philosophy language 6 works 7 see also notes biography little known qūnawī's personal life
young boy ṣadr al-dīn adopted ibn 'arabī whose pupil
persian descent nevertheless lived taught city konya modern-day turkey drew very close mawlāna jalāl-e dīn rūmī participated spiritual circle greatest saints
master ḥadīth people came konya distant lands just study under
while reputed profound understanding quran ḥadīth knew ancient peripatetic philosophy intimately no doubt thanks chiefly ibn sīnā commented extensively works aristotle
however qūnawī himself may studied arabic translation aristotle's metaphysics being handful truly insightful post-avicennan critics aristotle even full-fledged commentator spirit ibn rushd
qūnawī's overall influence appears strategic wide
moreover students found fame
instructed quțb al-dīn al-shīrāzī went author commentary now well-known suhrawardi's ḥikmat al-ishrāq

mystical vs
philosophical knowledge after visiting grave ibn 'arabī spell after teacher father-in-law died qūnavī described mystical experience teacher ibn 'arabī thus walked summery day through empty stretch taurus
easterly wind stirring blossoms
gazed them reflected upon god’s power might majesty exalted
love merciful [god] filled me such ardent passion labored part created things
then spirit shaykh ibn 'arabī personified me most splendid form pure light
called out [to me] “o ye perplexed behold me! god sublime transcendent hath shown himself me flash manifestation noble elevation essence absent hast thou me therein mere glance eye
agreed once standing there [bodily] before my eyes shaykh al-akbar [i
ibn arabī] greeted me salutations reunion after parting embraced me affectionately saying “praise god veil hath lifted bringeth those dear unto each other reunion
no goal effort salvation hath disaffirmed
recollection dream seems indicate just continuing deference teacher also saw practical end reason
though different intellectual breed deceased mentor qūnavī too practising mystic just thinker teacher
other words mystic excelled formal sciences like ḥadīth studies qurānic exegesis ijtihād dialectical theology kalām jurisprudence fiqh philosophical sciences corresponded contemporaries like nāsīr al-dīn ṭūsī whose mathematical astronomical discoveries become integral science know today
qūnavī's significance arises firm place islam's post-avicennan precisely post-falsafah period latin european scholastics themselves struggling problematics posed avicenna likely oblivious
yet intellectual current belonged provided context among other developments development systematic reason elaborate philosophical tradition emerged iran including prodigal ṣadr al-dīn shīrāzī mullā ṣadrā
although qūnavī single-mindedly devoted same general philosophical framework ibn 'arabī's 'abd al-raḥmān jāmī assured us despite pupil’s frustrated attempts follow spiritual footsteps without proper study qūnavī’s works true intention ibn 'arabī regarding so-called doctrine waḥdat al-wujūd doctrine progeny ascribed ibn 'arabī discerned any manner conforming both reason religious law jāmī 556
relationship aging teacher notwithstanding qūnavī stake out own personal connection higher knowledge
times seems distanced himself ibn 'arabī altogether due emphasis personal witness above interpretation others’ experience regardless their social spiritual station
1265 quoted saying teacher striven lead level god manifested himself through flashes manifestation seekers failed njk 222
mystics describe manifestation kind “flash” because “direct witnessing essence” resembles light speed evanescence any ordinary flash lightning
al-qāshānī likened “flash” “the illumination appearing person beckons summons presence proximity lord journey within god
ibn 'arabī referred deep tranquility felt saintly “friends god” awliyā’ take their repose
because tranquility occur them take furtive glances manifestation flash hakim 660-61
paradoxically then relationship ibn 'arabī provided qūnavī sound justification seeking separate path spiritual enlightenment hand developing proper terms express overarching truths other truths paradoxically accessible through personal experience anyone else’s
problem knowledge qūnavī considered life’s task complete ibn sīnā begun ishrāqī conception knowledge
first shared ibn sīnā ibn 'arabī goal representing intellectual/spiritual journey communicable fashion
any kind knowledge noetic discovery understood must capable being passed others pupils speculatively minded peers etc
rather hoarded abstract ether mind
whatever technical complexities didactically meaningful within specific time place though without losing sight root object knowledge
worked out principles several treatises
their most concise substantial statement consists theoretical introduction magnum opus i'jāz al-bayān main body consists mystical exegesis sūrat al-fātiḥah opening chapter quran
introduction qūnavī plotted transition demonstrative logic avicenna’s “theological science” 'ilm ilāhī different kind logic might call “exegetical grammar” less taught ibn 'arabī
followers ibn 'arabī “exegetical grammar” vastly suited paradoxical movements spirit “dialogue” god purely epistemological sense true “knowledge realities” expression qūnavī took chiefly avicennan inspiration
anxious preserve transcendence divine without expunging human activity initiative qūnavī understood god’s knowledge himself root knowledge
surface formulation logical corollaries flowing appear seal man’s incapacity discover “realities things” own
own inborn faculties
representative sense human knowledge may rest relation two distinct irreducible “realities” subject object
given subject-object distinction limitations our own faculties how ever know “realities things”? theme permeates virtually qūnavī’s works
introduction discussed several passages ibn sīnā’s posthumous al-ta'liqāt notebook
source cared mention ibn sīnā’s cogitations “realities” ta'liqāt contained unusually candid remark effect man incapable knowing realities things
took up selfsame issue naṣīr al-dīn ṭūsī
672/1274 fascinating philosophical correspondence tashkīk systematic ambiguity concept key later philosophy figures
debate our thinker sought demonstrate under conditions man may know god goal shared both philosophers mystics
larger sense qūnavī able deepen transformation philosophical reason begun predecessors virtue simple incontrovertible fact mechanical logic peripatetic philosophy quite overcome distinction subject object two most elementary “realities” every act knowing except correspondence concomitance etc
central project other hand divine self-revelation
matter ibn 'arabī applied notoriously convoluted reasoning often association fragmentary outbursts
like qūnavī viewed divine self-revelation -manifestation unfolding “book” penned form constructed speech
short self-revelation reality underlies realities
elaborate principles unfolding made thorough use demonstrative logic championed both falsāsifah islam's hellenized philosophers like ibn sīnā many islamic theologians
new synthesis keen elucidate theological science 'ilm ilāhī properly anchored logos exhibiting same characteristic concreteness familiar divine speech “god’s communications” man e
thus derived traditional logic mystical type exegetical grammar own “scale” standard theorization bears special imprint
intellectual environment official biographical account konya's intellectual elite aflākī portrayed close-knit community mystics scholars surprisingly uninhibited spiritual mien konya
yet incessant migrations anatolia given frontier capital distinctly cosmopolitan character making envy every seeker knowledge—muslim greek armenian—but also innumerable foes
time qūnavī’s father majd al-dīn isḥāq began career statesman reflecting mysticism’s pervasiveness acquired status revered spiritual figure
return journey pilgrimage holy city mecca isḥāq accompanied muḥyiddīn ibn 'arabī whom struck deep friendship
isḥāq died companion reportedly became ṣadr al-dīn’s stepfather marrying widowed mother
through marriage east met west anatolia’s medley spiritual cultural character last began take firmer shape
language primordial central spiritual mental activity
consider linguistic innovations mystic-poets like rūmī contributed secular development highbrow literary form persian
qūnavī’s peculiar bent arabic linguistics other hand placed comfortably lap arabic high culture even mystical exegetical grammar must collapsed conventional arabic grammar
part arabic provided qūnavī uninterrupted links traditional centers learning damascus aleppo cairo etc
religious sciences taught almost exclusively arabic language
numerous schools colleges earlier built ayyūbids syria egypt arabic studied people congregated over islamic world
landmark work al-nafaāt al-ilāhīyah qūnavī noted how matter al-kitābah al-ūlā al-ilāhīyah primary divine writing key feature doctrine came earlier version city damascus
damascus time fostered broad intellectual fraternity felt across traditional lines jurisprudence even religious sciences deep-rooted variegated there konya
specialized fields like ḥadīth studies qūnavī authority teacher exhibited fewer rigid doctrinal standards admission
most prestigious centers established earlier twelfth century dār al-ḥadīth al-ashrafīyah whose first shaykh celebrated shāfi'ī muḥaddith ibn al-ṣāliḥ al-shahrazūrī
unlike ibn 'arabī prayed mālikī qūnavī steeped shāfi'ī jurisprudence whose practitioners abundantly represented schools
while spheres influence less evenly distributed higher echelons academic scholarship centers like ashrafīyah scholars exerted intellectual influence disproportionate their numbers—one prominent example being abū shāma official chronicler damascus kept close liaison mālikī circles maghreb ibn 'arabī himself 179
mālikīs present special case because their small numbers schools belied their pervasive influence especially quranic sciences
their numerical preponderance iqrā’ quran recital naḥw grammar pouzet 179 managed sway general interest even toward arabic philology
view special relationship ibn 'arabī qūnavī easy access their exegetical sources
apart themes characteristic ibn 'arabī however there little evidence anything peculiarly mālikī maghrebi works qūnavī including grammar
affiliations remained close traditional eastern centers learning mālikīs underrepresented
damascus place qūnavī paid regular visits
also traveled aleppo cairo faithful following
intriguing how qūnavī’s spiritual bond rūmī scholar own right self-professed opponent bookish scholars developed point mutual admiration—according aflākī—as qūnavī continued produce works rarely equaled “arabic sciences” huart 281-82
mystical philosophy language primary vehicle human expression language capacity convey most profound experiences available human beings
qūnavī “devices conveyance” adawāt al-tawṣīl disclosed “incorporeal immaterial meanings” explored certain remove original experience presumably lay core
may differed markedly rūmī respect “literary practitioner”
poet after manner rūmī nor even grammarian profession
challenge take demonstrative science traditional philosophy toward exegetical grammar act quintessential language experience knowledge implied obligation instruct intricacies spiritual peregrination without substituting derived knowledge direct personal experience
model remained legitimate long central fact semantic unity divine speech maintained
find mystical reflections ibn 'arabī qūnavī alike encoded utterances embodying asymmetrical division two components instructive knowledge
philosophically consist mawḑū' subject maṭlūb object inquiry theological dialectics religious sciences generally known aṣl root far' branch
thus qūnavī’s view idea merely posit “root” know determine precise modalities our knowledge
simple unreflective cognizance pregiven religious fundamentals manner advocated salafi-minded ibn taymīyyah still knowledge yet nothing disentangle mundane influences normally impinge upon human faculty comprehension
central question posed “theological science” envisioned ibn sīnā “existence
form syllogism theological knowledge imparted consisted indemonstrable premises conclusion
indemonstrables given elements any syllogism “givens” posited through senses imagination intellect etc
science grand concept theology assembled pregivens derived lower sciences came under own jurisdiction because theological science very ground sciences
furthermore ibn sīnā saw existence something required just natural awareness things
nafaḥāt ilāhiyyah qūnavī admitted banal sense argue awareness existence simply posited way intuition “first cognizance” there no demonstrable proof true definition merely indistinct unity
however biggest issue insisted
difficulty arose “second cognizance” namely knowledge “reality distinguishable itself other realities”—in other words uniqueness reality
constituted locus classical philosophical dilemma preoccupied qūnavī
goal knowledge “knowledge realities things
may either deny knowledge man grounds natural faculties imperfect affirm risk according absolute knowledge
contrasted second cognizance stood first consisted “awareness existence” perception “thingness
demarcation indistinct thingness singular reality corresponded theological division “subject” mawḍūc “object inquiry” maṭlūb—what given sought way knowledge
realities plural consisted branches manifold qualities divine essence god manifests himself
behind structural view formulation remained vexing question should sought quest knowledge considered nothing original knowing subject revealed? because shay’ thing given subject like mawjūd existent “cause knowledge predominance precept there unity [thing] known whatever may
“unity” knower known any claim knowledge reality ultimately rest upon unity indicated knew reality manner revealed itself other reality knower simple identity two entities
any rate knower’s radical otherness renders any simple unity impossible
how then expect man finitude imperfection know merely “realities things” god creator ultimate reality? however unity rendered viable didactic sense through notion “consonance” two realities way their predominant attributes
possible virtue “pre-existing knowledge
hence philosophy process discovery moves procession-like known unknown
every “theological science” aristotle’s ibn sīnā’s qūnavī’s—no matter how formal however mellifluous spiritually meager utterances may be—accepted rudimentary principle
qūnavī’s credit took pains describe passage supersession occurred knowledge thing unique reality way special “unity” through consonance
other words knowledge form object inquiry “branch
there meets eye
movement here mechanical passage point other
possibility transmutation given level commonality two distinct realities knower known opened up through their consonance munāsabah
