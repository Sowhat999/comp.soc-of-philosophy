tucker's contribution american individualist anarchism much through publishing own writing
tucker also first publish english translation max stirner's ego own tucker claimed proudest accomplishment
tucker also translated mikhail bakunin's book god state
anarchist periodical liberty published original work stephen pearl andrews joshua k
ingalls lysander spooner auberon herbert dyer lum victor yarros lillian harman daughter free love anarchist moses harman well own writing
also published george bernard shaw's first original article appear united states first american translated excerpts friedrich nietzsche
liberty tucker both filtered integrated theories such european thinkers herbert spencer pierre-joseph proudhon economic legal theories american individualists lysander spooner william
greene josiah warren writings free thought free love movements opposition religiously based legislation prohibitions non-invasive[clarification needed] behavior
through these influences tucker produced rigorous system philosophical individualist anarchism called anarchistic-socialism arguing [the] most perfect socialism possible condition most perfect individualism
according frank brooks historian american individualist anarchism easy misunderstand tucker's claim socialism
before marxists established hegemony over definitions socialism term socialism broad concept
tucker well most writers readers liberty understood socialism refer various theories aimed solving labor problem through radical changes capitalist economy
descriptions 'the problem' explanations causes proposed solutions example abolition private property cooperatives state-ownership varied among socialist philosophies
tucker socialism claim labor should put possession own holding state socialism anarchistic socialism common labor theory value
however instead asserting socialist anarchists common ownership key eroding differences economic power appealing social solidarity tucker's individualist anarchism advocated distribution property undistorted natural market mediator egoistic impulses source social stability
tucker fact class men dependent their living upon sale their labour while another class men relieved necessity labour being legally privileged sell something labour
such state things am much opposed any
minute you remove privilege
every man will labourer exchanging fellow-labourers
anarchistic-socialism aims abolish usury
wants deprive capital reward
tucker first favored natural rights philosophy individual right own fruits labor then abandoned favor egoism influenced max stirner believed right might exists until overridden contract
objected forms communism believing even stateless communist society must encroach upon liberty individuals
denounced marx representative 'the principle authority live combat
thought proudhon superior theorist real champion freedom
'marx nationalize productive distributive forces proudhon individualize associate them
tucker connected economic views following form those pierre joseph proudhon josiah warren karl marx following form economic principles modern socialism logical deduction principle laid down adam smith early chapters “wealth nations” namely labor true measure price
half century after smith enunciated principle above stated socialism picked up dropped following logical conclusions made basis new economic philosophy
seems done independently three different men three different nationalities three different languages josiah warren american pierre j
proudhon frenchman karl marx german jew
work interesting trio should done nearly simultaneously seem indicate socialism air time ripe conditions favorable appearance new school thought
far priority time concerned credit seems belong warren american fact should noted stump orators fond declaiming against socialism imported article

saw interest profit form exploitation made possible banking monopoly turn maintained through coercion invasion
tucker called any such interest profit usury saw basis oppression workers
words interest theft rent robbery profit another name plunder
tucker believed usury immoral however upheld right people engage immoral contracts
liberty therefore must defend right individuals make contracts involving usury rum marriage prostitution many other things believed wrong principle opposed human well-being
right wrong involves essence rights
asserted anarchism meaningless unless includes liberty individual control product whatever product brought through exchange free market private property
land monopoly acknowledged anything product upon human labor expended recognize full property rights labored-upon land should noted however case land any other material supply limited cannot hold unlimited quantities anarchism undertakes protect no titles except such based upon actual occupancy use
tucker opposed granting title land use argued individual should use land continually order retain exclusive right
believed practice followed there 'land monopoly'
money banking monopoly tucker also opposed state protection 'banking monopoly' requirement must obtain charter engage business banking
hoped raise wages deregulating banking industry reasoning competition banking drive down interest rates stimulate enterprise
tucker believed decrease proportion individuals seeking employment wages driven up competing employers
thus same blow strikes interest down will send wages up
oppose individuals being employed others due interpretation labor theory value believed present economy individuals receive wage fully compensates them their labor
four monopolies ended will make no difference whether men work themselves employed employ others
any case get nothing wages their labor free competition determines
tariffs patents tucker opposed protectionism believing tariffs caused high prices preventing national producers having compete foreign competitors
believed free trade help keep prices low therefore assist laborers receiving their natural wage
tucker believe intellectual property rights form patents grounds patents copyrights protect something cannot rightfully held property
basis property fact impossible nature things concrete objects used different places same time
property concrete things socially necessary since successful society rests individual initiative [it necessary] protect individual creator use concrete creations forbidding others use them without consent
because ideas concrete things should held protected property
ideas used different places same time their use should restricted patents
source conflict philosophy fellow individualist lysander spooner saw ideas product intellectual labor therefore private property
yarros tucker according victor yarros [tucker] opposed savagely any reform movements paternalistic aims looked state aid fulfillment
same reason consistent unrelenting opposition compulsion combated populism greenbackism single-tax movement forms socialism communism
denounced exposed johann most editor freiheit anarchist-communist organ
end declared never justify means means intrinsically immoral force whomsoever used immoral except means preventing punishing aggression
attitude towards unions tucker rejected legislative programs labor unions laws imposing short day minimum wage laws forcing businesses provide insurance employees compulsory pension systems
believed instead strikes should organized free workers rather bureaucratic union officials organizations
argued strikes whenever wherever inaugurated deserve encouragement friends labour
show people beginning know their rights knowing dare maintain them
furthermore awakening agent agitating force beneficent influence strike immeasurable
our present economic system almost every strike just
justice production distribution? labour creates shall
anarchist society tucker envisioned individualist anarchist society each man reaping fruits labour no man able live idleness income capital
become[ing] great hive anarchistic workers prosperous free individuals [combining] carry their production distribution cost principle
rather bureaucratic organization workers organized rank file unions
however hold genuine appreciation labor unions called trades-union socialism saw intelligent self-governing socialism saying [they] promise coming substitution industrial socialism usurping legislative mobism
carson's critique tucker's concept four monopolies discussed kevin carson book studies mutualist political economy
carson incorporates idea thesis exploitation labor possible due state intervention
however argues tucker failed notice fifth form privilege transportation subsidies
form contemporary government intervention tucker almost entirely ignored transportation subsidies
seems odd first glance since internal improvements controversial issue throughout 19 th century central part mercantilist agenda whigs gilded age gop
indeed lincoln announced beginning career short sweet embrace henry clay's program national bank high tariff internal improvements
neglect however keeping tucker's inclination
concerned privilege primarily promoted monopoly profits through unfair exchange individual level affected overall structure production
kind government intervention james o'connor later write promoted accumulation concentration directly subsidizing operating costs big business largely escaped notice
carson believes tucker's four monopolies transportation subsidies created foundation monopoly capitalism military-industrial complex 20 th century
ironically carson also noted heavy use new monopoly state may grounds optimism tucker unaware
order maintain corporate system state forced continually ratchet up level subsidies provides until very close bankruptcy
private defense forces tucker utopian vision anarchy individuals coerce others
advocated liberty property defended private institutions
opposing monopoly state providing security advocated free market competing defense providers saying defense service like any other service
labor both useful desired therefore economic commodity subject law supply demand
anarchism does exclude prisons officials military other symbols force
merely demands non-invasive men shall made victims such force
anarchism reign love reign justice
does signify abolition force-symbols application force real invaders
tucker expressed market-based providers security offer protection land being used offer assistance those attempting collect rent 'the land people'
means protection
voluntary associations maintenance justice
people desire cultivate land possession whatever land personally cultivate
positive refusal protecting power lend aid collection any rent whatsoever

rejecting idea moral rights tucker there two rights right might right contract
also after converting egoist individualism times past
my habit talk glibly right man land
bad habit long ago sloughed off
man's right land might over
adopting stirnerite egoism 1886 tucker rejected natural rights long considered foundation libertarianism
rejection galvanized movement fierce debates natural rights proponents accusing egoists destroying libertarianism itself
bitter conflict number natural rights proponents withdrew pages liberty protest even though hitherto among frequent contributors
thereafter liberty championed egoism although general content change significantly
led split american individualism growing number egoists contemporary spoonerian natural lawyers
tucker came hold position no rights exist until created contract
led controversial positions such claiming infants no rights property their parents because ability contract
person physically tries stop mother throwing her baby fire should punished violating her property rights
children shed their status property became old enough contract buy sell house example noting precocity varies age determined jury case complaint
also came believe aggression towards others justifiable doing led greater decrease aggregate pain refraining doing
ultimate end human endeavor minimum pain
aim decrease invasion because rule invasion increases total pain meaning course pain suffered ego whether directly through sympathy others
precisely my contention rule despite immense importance place upon absolute contrary there exceptional cases invasion coercion non-invasive lessens aggregate pain
therefore coercion non-invasive justifiable justified ground secures minimum invasion minimum pain
[t]o me [it is] axiomatic ultimate end minimum pain tucker now there two rights right might right contract
also after converting egoist individualism ownership land legitimately transferred through force unless contracted otherwise
1892 times past
my habit talk glibly right man land
bad habit long ago sloughed off
man's right land might over
neighbor mightier takes land then land neighbor's until latter dispossessed mightier still
however believed individuals come realization equal liberty occupancy use doctrines generally trustworthy guiding principle action result likely find their interests contract each other refrain infringing upon equal liberty protecting land use
though believed non-invasion occupancy use title land general rules people find their own interests create through contract these rules must sometimes trodden underfoot

1913 came out retirement two years contribute articles letters new freewoman called most important publication existence
later tucker became much pessimistic prospects anarchism
1926 vanguard press published selection writings entitled individual liberty tucker added postscript state socialism anarchism stated forty years ago foregoing essay written denial competition yet effected enormous concentration wealth now gravely threatens social order
yet too late stem current accumulation reversal policy monopoly
anarchistic remedy still applicable
tucker argued today way clear
four monopolies unhindered made possible modern development trust trust now monster fear even freest banking instituted unable destroy
true then monopoly controlled permanently economic forces passed moment beyond their reach must grappled time solely forces political revolutionary
until measures forcible confiscation through state defiance shall abolished concentrations monopoly created economic solution proposed anarchism outlined forgoing pages there no other solution
[it] will remain thing taught rising generation conditions may favorable application after great leveling
education slow process may come too quickly
anarchists endeavor hasten joining propaganda state socialism revolution make sad mistake indeed
help force march events people will time find out study their experience their troubles due rejection competition
1930 tucker concluded centralization advancing technology doomed both anarchy civilization
matter my famous 'postscript' now sinks insignificance insurmountable obstacle realization anarchy no longer power trusts indisputable fact our civilization death throes
may last couple centuries yet other hand decade may precipitate our finish
dark ages sure enough
