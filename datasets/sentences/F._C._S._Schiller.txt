schiller made first contribution philosophy anonymously
schiller feared time high naturalism metaphysical speculations riddles sphinx likely hurt professional prospects p
xi riddles
however schiller's fear reprisal anti-metaphysical colleagues should suggest schiller friend metaphysics
like fellow pragmatists across ocean schiller attempting stake out intermediate position both spartan landscape naturalism speculative excesses metaphysics time
riddles schiller both accuses naturalism also sometimes calls pseudometaphysics positivism ignoring fact metaphysics required justify our natural description world 2 accuses abstract metaphysics losing sight world actually live constructing grand disconnected imaginary worlds
result schiller contends naturalism cannot make sense higher aspects our world freewill consciousness god purpose universals while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense lower aspects our world imperfect change physicality
each case unable guide our moral epistemological lower lives achievement life's higher ends ultimately leading scepticism both fronts
knowledge morality possible both world's lower higher elements must real e
need universals higher make knowledge particulars lower possible
lead schiller argue time called concrete metaphysics later call humanism
shortly after publishing riddles sphinx schiller became acquainted work pragmatist philosopher william james changed course career
time schiller's work became focused extending developing james' pragmatism under schiller's preferred title humanism
schiller even revised earlier work riddles sphinx make nascent pragmatism implicit work explicit
schiller's most prominent works during phase career axioms postulates 1903 schiller extended james' will believe doctrine show how used justify acceptance god also our acceptance causality uniformity nature our concept identity contradiction law excluded middle space time goodness god
towards end career schiller's pragmatism began take character unique pragmatism william james
schiller's focus became opposition formal logic
understand schiller's opposition formal logic consider following inference salt soluble water 2 cerebos soluble water 3 therefore cerebos salt
formal characteristics inference alone bs c therefore c formal logic judge valid inference
schiller however refused evaluate validity inference merely formal characteristics
schiller argued unless look contextual fact regarding specific problem first prompted inference actually occur determine whether inference successful
pragmatically successful
case inference since cerebos 'salt' culinary chemical purposes without knowing whether purpose piece reasoning culinary chemical cannot determine whether valid
another example schiller discusses truth formal mathematics 1+1=2 points out equation does hold discussing drops water
schiller's attack formal logic formal mathematics never gained much attention philosophers however does share weak similarities contextualist view contemporary epistemology well views ordinary language philosophers
opposition naturalism metaphysics riddles schiller gives historical examples dangers abstract metaphysics philosophies plato zeno hegel portraying hegel worst offender hegelianism never anywhere gets within sight fact within touch reality
reason simple you cannot without paying penalty substitute abstractions realities thought-symbol cannot duty thing symbolized
schiller argued flaw hegel's system systems abstract metaphysics world constructs proves unhelpful guiding our imperfect changing particular physical lives achievement higher universal ideals ends
example schiller argues reality time change intrinsically opposed very modus operandi systems abstract metaphysics
says possibility change precondition any moral action action generally any system abstract metaphysics bound lead us moral scepticism
problem lies aim abstract metaphysics interpreting world terms conceptions should true here now eternally independently time change
result metaphysics must use conceptions time-aspect reality abstracted away
course [o]nce abstracted reference time course recovered any individuality reality deduced once ignored
assumption made express 'truth' reality 'thisness' individuality change immersion certain temporal spatial environment may neglected timeless validity conception thus substituted living changing perishing existence contemplate
[…] wish here point out merely unreasonable expect such premises arrive deductive justification very characteristics reality excluded
true reason then why hegelism give no reason time-process
fact world 'in time' changes continuously constructed give account world irrespective time change
you insist having system eternal immutable 'truth' you get abstracting those characteristics reality try express terms individuality time change
you must pay price formula will enable you make assertions hold good far beyond limits your experience
part price you will end unable give rational explanation those very characteristics you dismissed outset irrelevant rational explanation
while abstract metaphysics provides us world beauty purpose various other highers condemns other key aspects world live imaginary
world abstract metaphysics no place imperfect moral agents strive learn world then 2 act upon world change better
consequently abstract metaphysics condemns us illusionary declares our place world unimportant purposeless
abstractions take priority our concrete lives collapse scepticism pessimism
making case naturalist method also results epistemological moral scepticism schiller looks show method's inadequacy moving cold lifeless lower world atoms higher world ethics meanings minds
abstract metaphysics schiller attacks naturalism many fronts naturalist method unable reduce universals particulars 2 naturalist method unable reduce freewill determinist movements 3 naturalist method unable reduce emergent properties like consciousness brain activity 4 naturalist method unable reduce god pantheism
just abstract method cannot find place lower elements our world inside higher naturalist method cannot find place higher elements our world inside lower
reversal abstract metaphysics naturalism denies reality higher elements save lower
schiller uses term pseudo-metaphysical here instead naturalism—as sometimes does—because accusing these naturalist philosophers trying solve metaphysical problems while sticking non-metaphysical lower aspects world
without engaging real metaphysics pseudo-metaphysical method puts forward method science method philosophy
doomed perpetual failure
[…] [t]he data supplied physical sciences intractable because data lower sort facts explain
objects physical sciences form lower orders hierarchy existence extensive less significant
thus atoms physicist may indeed found organisation conscious beings subordinate living organism exhibits actions cannot formulated laws physics alone man material also great deal
show world’s higher elements reduce lower yet show naturalism must condemn world’s higher elements illusionary
second component schiller’s attack showing naturalism cannot escape inability reduce higher lower asserting these higher elements evolve lower
however schiller does see naturalism any capable explaining evolution higher lower capable reducing higher lower
while evolution does begin something lower turn evolves something higher problem naturalism whatever starting point evolution must first something potential evolve higher
example world cannot come existence nothing because potential germ world nothing nothing no potential nothing after nothing
likewise biological evolution cannot begin inanimate matter because potential life inanimate matter
following passage shows schiller applying same sort reasoning evolution consciousness taken type pseudo-metaphysical method explains higher lower […] does explain genesis consciousness out unconscious matter because cannot attribute potential consciousness matter
theory evolution derives [end result] germ
became potentially
unable either reduce explain evolution higher elements our world naturalism left explain away higher elements mere illusions
doing naturalism condemns us scepticism both epistemology ethics
worth noting while schiller's work largely neglected since death schiller's arguments against naturalistic account evolution recently cited advocates intelligent design establish existence longer history view due legal concerns united states see kitzmiller v
dover area school district
humanist alternative metaphysics naturalism schiller argued both abstract metaphysics naturalism portray man holding intolerable position world
proposed method recognises lower world interact takes account higher world purposes ideals abstractions
schiller require then method combines excellencies both pseudo-metaphysical abstract metaphysical philosophy possible
schiller demanding course correction field metaphysics putting service science
example explain creation world out nothing explain emergence evolution higher parts world schiller introduces divine being might generate end
final cause gives nothingness lifelessness unconscious matter purpose thus potential evolving higher forms thus far dispensing need divine first cause theory evolution faith science carry conclusion courage interpret proves irrefragably no evolution possible without pre-existent deity deity moreover transcendent non-material non-phenomenal
[…] [t]he world process working out anterior purpose idea divine consciousness
re-introduction teleology schiller sometimes calls re-anthropomorphizing world schiller says naturalist become afraid
schiller's method concrete metaphysics
humanism allows appeal metaphysics science demands
however [t]he new teleology capricious random application firmly rooted conclusions sciences […
process theory evolution divined history world must content meaning determined basis scientific data careful study history thing determine direction development [and then] made first approximation knowledge end world process
[this] teleology totally different kind vehemently whole justly dreaded modern exponents natural science
does attempt explain things anthropocentrically regard creation existing use benefit man far scientist supposing cork-trees grow supply us champagne corks
end supposes things subserve […] universal end world-process things tend[
schiller finally reveals end things tend our speculations entirely missed their mark world-process will come end spirits whom designed harmonise [by divine creator] united perfect society
now while today's philosophic standards schiller's speculations considered wildly metaphysical disconnected sciences compared metaphysicians day hegel mc taggart etc
schiller saw himself radically scientific
schiller gave philosophy number labels during career
early used names concrete metaphysics anthropomorphism while later life tending towards pragmatism particularly humanism
will believe schiller also developed method philosophy intended mix elements both naturalism abstract metaphysics way allows us avoid twin scepticisms each method collapses followed own
however schiller does assume enough justify humanism over other two methods
accepts possibility both scepticism pessimism true
justify attempt occupy middle ground naturalism abstract metaphysics schiller makes move anticipates james' will believe action especially often forced act upon slight possibilities
hence shown our solution possible answer possible alternative pessimism complete despair life deserve acceptance even though bare possibility
schiller contends light other methods' failure provide humans role place universe ought avoid adoption these methods
end riddles schiller offers method humanism possible method results world navigate our lower existence achievement our higher purpose
asserts method ought adopt regardless evidence against even though bare possibility
while schiller's will believe central theme riddle sphinx appearing mainly introduction conclusion text 1891 doctrine held limited role schiller's philosophy
riddles schiller employs version will believe doctrine faced overcoming sceptic pessimistic methods philosophy
1897 william james published essay will believe influenced schiller drastically expanded application doctrine
1903 volume titled personal idealism schiller contributed widely read essay titled axioms postulates sets out justify axioms logic postulates adopted basis will believe doctrine
essay schiller extends will believe doctrine basis our acceptance causality uniformity nature our concept identity contradiction law excluded middle space time goodness god
notes postulate nature uniform because need nature uniform [o]ut hurly-burly events time space [we] extract[ changeless formulas whose chaste abstraction soars above reference any 'where' 'when' thereby renders them blank cheques filled up our pleasure any figures sort
question is—will nature honour cheque? audentes natura juvat—let us take our life our hands try! fail our blood will our own hands probably else's stomach though fail no worse case those dared postulate […] our assumption therefore least methodological necessity may turn out near fundamental fact nature [an axiom]
schiller stresses doctrines like uniformity nature must first postulated basis need evidence then justified evidence their practical working
attacks both empiricists like john stuart mill try conclude nature uniform previous experience well kantians conclude nature uniform preconditions our understanding
schiller argues preconditions conclusions demands made our experience may may work
success hinges our continued acceptance postulate eventual promotion axiom status
axioms postulates schiller vindicates postulation success practice marking important shift riddles sphinx
riddles schiller concerned vague aim connecting higher lower avoid scepticism 1903 clarified connection sees these two elements
higher abstract elements connected lower because our inventions dealing lower their truth depends their success tools
schiller dates entry element thinking 1892 essay reality 'idealism' mere year after 1891 riddles

ritchie entitled call 'sunrise' theory
chaos presentations out criteria ultimately practical isolated phenomena subsequently call sunrise theory fact called theories being
addition generating hypothetical objects explain phenomena interpretation reality our thought also bestows derivative reality abstractions thought works
instruments wherewith thought accomplishes such effects upon reality must surely themselves real
shift schiller's thinking continues next published work metaphysics time-process 1895 abstractions metaphysics then exist explanations concrete facts life latter illustrations former […] science [along humanism] does refuse interpret symbols operates contrary their applicability concrete facts originally abstracted held justify their use establish their 'truth
schiller's accusations against metaphysician riddles now appear pragmatic light
objection similar might make against worker constructs flat-head screwdriver help build home then accuses screw unreality comes upon phillips-screw flat-head screwdriver won't fit
works after riddles schiller's attack takes form reminding abstract metaphysician abstractions meant tools dealing lower world particulars physicality after constructing abstractions cannot simply drop un-abstracted world out our account
un-abstracted world entire reason making abstractions first place
abstract reach unchanging eternal truths abstract construct imperfect rough tool dealing life our particular concrete world
working higher making predictions future behavior things purpose shaping future behavior things purpose shaping our own conduct accordingly justifies higher

question 'practical' working truth will ultimately found resolve itself question whether live
few lines down passage schiller adds following footnote 1903 reprint essay seems very fairly definite anticipation modern pragmatism
indeed resembles pragmatist theory truth
however schiller’s pragmatism still very different both william james charles sanders peirce
opposition logic early 1891 schiller independently reached doctrine very similar william james' will believe
early 1892 schiller independently developed own pragmatist theory truth
however schiller's concern meaning entirely imports pragmatisms james peirce
later life schiller musters these elements pragmatism make concerted attack formal logic
concerned bringing down timeless perfect worlds abstract metaphysics early life central target schiller's developed pragmatism abstract rules formal logic
statements schiller contends cannot possess meaning truth abstracted away their actual use
therefore examining their formal features instead their function actual situation make same mistake abstract metaphysician makes
symbols meaningless scratches paper unless given life situation meant someone accomplish task
tools dealing concrete situations proper subjects study themselves
both schiller's theory truth meaning
schiller's pragmatism derive their justification examination thought calls humanist viewpoint new name concrete metaphysics
informs us answer precisely meant having meaning will require us raise prior question why think
question schiller course looks evolution provide
schiller provides detailed defence pragmatist theories truth meaning chapter titled biologic judgment logic use 1929
account schiller lays out many ways resembles peirce asserts fixation belief 1877 essay our account function judgment our mental life will however start long way back
there much thinking before there any judging much living before there any thinking
even highly developed minds judging relatively rare incident thinking thinking living exception rather rule relatively recent acquisition
[…] most part living organism adapts itself conditions life earlier easier quicker expedients
actions reactions mostly 'reflex actions' determined inherited habits largely function automatically […] follows elaborate admirable organisation adaptive responses stimulation organic life might proceed without thinking altogether
[…] fact way most living being carry their life plane man also lives most time
thought therefore abnormality springs disturbance
genesis connected peculiar deficiency life habit
[…] whenever […] becomes biologically important notice differences roughly similar situations adjust action closely peculiarities particular case guidance life habit instinct impulse breaks down
new expedient somehow devised effecting such exact delicate adjustments
raison d'etre variously denominated 'thought' ‘reason' ‘reflection' ‘reasoning' 'judgment[
]’ […] thinking however much substitute earlier processes subsidiary addition them
pays certain cases intelligence may shown also discerning wiser act without thinking
[…] philosophers however very mistaken ideas rational action
tend think men ought think time things
get nothing done shorten their lives without enhancing their merriment
also utterly misconceive nature rational action
represent consisting perpetual use universal rules whereas consists rather perceiving general rule must set aside order conduct may adapted particular case
passage schiller worth quoting length because insight chapter offers schiller's philosophy
passage schiller makes claim thought occurs our unthinking habits prove themselves inadequate handling particular situation
schiller's stressing genesis limited occurrences thought sets schiller up account meaning truth
schiller asserts person utters statement situation doing specific purpose solve problem habit handle alone
meaning such statement whatever contribution makes accomplishing purpose particular occurrence thought
truth statement will helps accomplishes purpose
no utterance thought given meaning truth valuation outside context these particular occurrences thought
account schiller’s much extreme view even james took
first glance schiller appears very similar james
however schiller’s stringent requirement meaningful statements consequences purpose makes schiller’s position extreme james’
schiller sufficient condition meaningfulness statement entail experiential consequences both peirce james
schiller requires consequences statement make statement relevant particular person’s goals specific moment time meaningful
therefore simply enough statement diamonds hard statement diamonds soft entail different experiential consequences also required experiential difference makes difference someone’s purposes
then person two statements state something different
experiential difference hard soft diamonds connect up my purpose entering thought two statements possess same meaning
example randomly blurt out diamonds hard then diamonds soft everyone coffee shop day my words mean nothing
words mean something stated specific purpose
consequently schiller rejects idea statements meaning truth looked upon abstract away particular context
diamonds hard possesses meaning stated believed specific situation specific person uttered believed specific aim
consequences statement holds person’s purposes constitute meaning usefulness accomplishing person’s purposes constitutes statement’s truth falsity
after look sentence diamonds hard particular situation may find actually nothing say diamonds
speaker may very well using sentence joke codephrase even simply example sentence 15 letters
sentence really means cannot determined without specific purpose person might using statement specific context
article titled pragmatism pseudo-pragmatism schiller defends pragmatism against particular counterexample way sheds considerable light pragmatism impossibility answering truly question whether 100 th 10000 th decimal evaluation pi 9 splendidly illustrates how impossible predicate truth abstraction actual knowing actual purpose
question cannot answered until decimal calculated
until then no knows rather will turn out
no will calculate until serves purpose therefore interests himself calculation
until then truth remains uncertain there no 'true' answer because there no actual context question really raised
merely number conflicting possibilities even claims truth there no decision
yet decision possible experiment performed
experiment presupposes desire know
will made point becomes practically important decide
normally no doubt does become such because actual purposes sciences makes no difference whether suppose figure 9 something else
truth say 99 th decimal true enough our purposes 100 th matter indifference
let indifference cease question become important truth will once become useful
taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves actual context actual question there no true answer got until truth become useful
point illustrated also context prof
taylor himself suggested
made question 100 th decimal important making refutation whole pragmatist theory knowledge depend
nobler use 100 th decimal eyes? consequence interest will set himself work out will discover once useless now most useful truth and—triumphantly refute own contention! might recognise claim sort absurdity many philosophers try read pragmatism william james
james however agree meaning 100 th decimal pi 9 100 th decimal pi 6 mean same thing until someone reason care any possible difference
schiller constast does mean say
james schiller both treat truth something happens statement james agree becomes true 100 th decimal pi 9 someone fact believes statement leads them their goals nowhere does james imply meaning something happens statement
unique element schiller's pragmatism
humanist theory meaning truth while schiller felt greatly indebted pragmatism william james schiller outright hostile pragmatism c
both schiller james struggled peirce intended pragmatism both often baffled peirce's insistent rebuffing both saw natural elaboration pragmatist cornerstone himself first laid down
basis misunderstandings schiller complains peirce merely say 'truths should practical consequences' very vague hints no reason curious connexion asserts
schiller goes denigrate peirce's principle nothing simple truism hardly deserves permanent place name philosophic usage
after schiller points out [i]t hard […] see why even extremest intellectualism should deny difference truth falsehood assertion must show itself visible way
peirce's attempts restrict use pragmatism set aside schiller unpacks term consequences provide considers substantial restatement peirce's pragmatism say [statement] consequences none meaningless must surely mean bearing upon human interest must consequences purpose
schiller believes pragmatism developed because attention fact consequences make up meaning truth statement must consequences someone's particular purposes particular time
continuing condemnation abstract schiller contends meaning concept consequences abstract proposition consequences actual thinker hopes use will bring actual situation
meaning thought consequences means bring employ thought
schiller sophisticated pragmatist understands term meaning
understand pragmatic theory meaning schiller's way right claim james' theory truth mere corollary pragmatist theory meaning now may ask how these 'consequences' test 'truth' claimed assertion? satisfying thwarting purpose forwarding baffling interest
assertion 'good' pro tanto 'true' other 'bad' 'false'
'consequences' therefore investigated turn out involve 'practical' predicates 'good 'bad' contain reference practice' sense used term
soon therefore go beyond abstract statement narrower pragmatism ask concrete actual knowing 'having consequences may mean develop inevitably fullblown pragmatism wider sense
given schiller's view meaning thought amounts consequences means bring thought schiller further concluded truth thought depends whether actually brings consequences intended
example while following cooking recipe called salt think myself cerebos salt my thought will true consequently leads me add cerebos produce dish intended taste
however while working chemistry lab produce certain mixture think myself cerebos salt my thought both different meaning before since my intent now differs false since cerebos equivalent salt culinary purposes
according schiller question thought like cerebos salt means whether true answered specific circumstances thought arose taken consideration
while there similarity here schiller's view meaning later ordinary language philosophers schiller's account ties meaning truth closely individuals their intent specific use rather whole linguistic communities
