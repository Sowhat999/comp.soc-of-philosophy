ultimately argued united states simply skilled enough run world
why americans willing pay taxes order support world-girdling national security establishment asked walt 2013 yet reluctant pay taxes better schools health care roads bridges subways parks museums libraries other trappings wealthy successful society? question especially puzzling given united states most secure power history will remain remarkably secure unless keeps repeating errors past decade

israel walt critic israel lobby united states influence says foreign policy
president obama erred breaking principles cairo speech allowing continued israeli settlement activity participating well-coordinated assault against goldstone report
walt suggested 2010 owing state department diplomat dennis ross's alleged partiality toward israel might give president obama advice against us interests
robert satloff executive director washington institute near east policy winep defended ross criticized walt piece published foreign affairs published walt's piece few days earlier
satloff ross's connection winep innocuous ross distinguished fellow winep throughout george w
bush's administration mearsheimer walt's book described winep part core israel lobby united states walt mistakenly believes u
cannot simultaneously advance strategic partnership both israel friendly arab muslim states after itamar attack jewish family killed west bank march 2011 walt condemned murderers added while should spare other parties helped create perpetuate circumstances listing every israeli government since 1967 actively promoting illegal effort colonize these lands palestinian leaders glorified violence settlers themselves whom routinely use violence intimidate palestinians live lands covet
walt criticized us voting against security council resolution condemning israel's west bank settlements calling vote foolish step because resolution fact consistent official policy every president since lyndon johnson
iran walt frequently criticized america's policy respect iran
2011 walt interviewer american reaction alleged iranian plot assassinate saudi ambassador united states might part larger american diplomatic effort put iran hot seat
washington continues insist near-total iranian capitulation walt december
because iran effectively demonized here america very hard president obama reach compromise then sell back home
walt november 2013 americans often forget just how secure united states especially compared other states thanks power resources geography thus routinely blows minor threats out proportion
mean iran defense budget $10 billion
yet manage convince ourselves iran very serious threat u
vital interests
ditto constant fretting minor-league powers like syria north korea muammar al-qaddafi's libya other so-called 'rogue states
therefore whatever happens middle east united states almost certainly adjust adapt just fine
libya after visiting libya walt foreign policy january 2010 while libya far democracy also doesn't feel like other police states visited
caught no whiff omnipresent security service—which say aren't there
libyans whom spoke open candid gave no sign being worried being overheard reported anything like
tried visiting various political websites my hotel room no problems although other human rights groups report libya does engage selective filtering political websites critical regime
also crime criticize qaddafi himself government's past human rights record disturbing best press libya almost entirely government-controlled
nonetheless libya appears open contemporary iran china overall atmosphere seemed far less oppressive most places visited old warsaw pact
david e
bernstein foundation professor george mason university school law criticized walt 2011 accepting funding libyan government trip libya addressed country's economic development board then bernstein called puff piece visit
bernstein ironic walt after fulminating american domestic 'israel lobby' thus become part 'libya lobby'
bernstein found ironic walt leading critic friendship u
israel concludes piece hope 'that united states libya continue nurture build constructive relationship
because you know israel much nastier qaddafi's libya

peretz contrasted walt's view libya peretz noted visited less day new york times report depicting tripoli war zone
syria august 2013 walt argued even turned out bashar al-assad syria used chemical weapons u
should intervene
dead dead no matter how done walt
yes obama may tempted strike because foolishly drew 'red line' over issue feels credibility now stake
following foolish step another will restore lost standing
september 2013 walt open letter asking congressman vote against strike syria
josef olmert pointed out least two glaring inaccuracies including walt's failure recognize syria already failed state already riven sectarian struggle something 'realist' liberals find somehow hard accept
olmert noted despite walt's professed belief israel center middle east conflicts israel fact nothing conflicts syria egypt tunisia other countries region mostly makings arabs ones ought solved them
asia walt posits offshore balancing most desirable strategy dealing china
2011 walt argued china will seek gain regional hegemony broad sphere influence asia comparable size usa's position western hemisphere
happens predicts china secure enough mainland give added attention shaping events favour far flung areas
given china resource poor nation will likely aim safeguard vital sea lanes areas such persian gulf
december interview walt united states does help own cause exaggerating chinese power

modification balance power theory developed neorealist kenneth waltz
snowden case july 2013 walt argued president obama should give edward snowden immediate pardon
