614 th commandment interpreted moral imperative jews use facts holocaust give up god judaism - case secular jews well - continuing survival jewish people thereby giving hitler posthumous victory
meaning imperative subject serious dialogue both within beyond jewish community
opposition goals hitler moral touchstone implications several sensitive issues
new moral imperative traditional jewish law contains 613 mitzvot commandments compiled maimonides
these laws–365 negative e
thou shalt
248 positive–cover aspects life
fackenheim asserted tradition anticipate holocaust law 614 th commandment became necessary
thou shalt hand hitler posthumous victories
despair god israel continue hitler’s work
proposes people jewish heritage moral obligation observe their faith thus frustrate hitler's goal eliminating judaism earth
perhaps added evil inclination also amalek's work should prevented
fackenheim came conclusion slowly
professor philosophy university toronto reform rabbi become zionist until 1967 reaction holocaust implications jewish law crystallized meeting just before six day war
meeting new york make speech
before holocaust never essential my ideology
however chairman 'you've got face it' face
most important thing ever
fuller expression sentiment fackenheim explains concept way
first commanded survive jews lest jewish people perish
commanded secondly remember our very guts bones martyrs holocaust lest their memory perish
forbidden thirdly deny despair god however much may contend belief lest judaism perish
forbidden finally despair world place become kingdom god lest help make meaningless place god dead irrelevant everything permitted
abandon any these imperatives response hitler's victory auschwitz hand yet other posthumous victories
terminology dialogue subject choice words sensitive matter
within jewish community absolutely reject fackenheim's assertion called commandment
commandment 580 already forbids adding torah commandments
wording expresses concept form commandment may also give offense
becomes contentious point because references 614 th commandment unique fackenheim
concise term other shortcomings besides theological objection
count addition jewish law implicit statement applies jews
opposition goals hitler universal concept
gentiles respect studying holocaust opposing anti-semitism
christian contexts ideal sometimes appears th commandment
christians generally recognize 10 commandments old testament
may give unintentional offense jews recognize different th commandment may lead confusion other unrelated ideas christians called th commandment
jesus stated two commandments love lord thy god thy heart soul mind strength
love thy neighbor thyself
although there no single formulation expresses concept terms avoid controversy posthumous victories hitler appear most descriptions
implications zionism fackenheim applied reasoning state israel law return necessity prevent second holocaust
jewish state existed 1930 s accepted jewish refugees rescued large numbers people
opinion carries clout most jewish people although specifics how apply contemporary politics subject debate

conversion other religions within broader context religious tolerance concept applies sensitive subjects conversion intermarriage
gregory baum german-born catholic theologian professor emeritus religious studies mc gill university montreal expresses effect concept christian views toward conversion
perspective most christian faiths whose doctrines normally advocate conversion nonbelievers represents deep respect fackenheim's concept after auschwitz christian churches no longer wish convert jews
while may sure theological grounds dispense them mission churches become aware asking jews become christians spiritual way blotting them out existence thus reinforces effects holocaust
fackenheim's affirmation jewish heritage although embraced many other holocaust survivors no means universal
physicist lise meitner born brought up jewish
she rejected newspaper attempts characterize her jew following bombing hiroshima press learned she first scientist recognize nuclear fission
decades before hitler rose power she become lutheran
although nazis stole her savings ruined her career she refused work bomb let hitler define her identity
intermarriage intermarriages jews non-jews relatively common united states canada
several circumstances complicate these unions perspective jewish community
different movements within judaism recognize different standards conversion judaism transmission their heritage
social pressure generally falls upon men marry jewish women because movements recognize jewish woman's offspring jews
note starting late 1960 s several movements judaism ceased recognizing jewish women's offspring jews women intermarried

am jewish teach my children my students jewish just spite hitler
same criticism formulated jewish philosopher michael wyschogrod 1971 review god's presence history
wyschogrod questioned value definition judaism merely inverts antisemitism bigoted “semitism
uniqueness auschwitz historical event moreover dubious distinction
“it necessary recognize any universally humanistic framework destruction european jewry notable chapter long record man’s inhumanity against man
satisfied criticism however wyschogrod offered traditional explanation jewish claim uniqueness chosenness formulated positive terms
fate israel central concern because israel elect people god through whom god’s redemptive work done world
however tragic human suffering human plane happens israel directly tied role nation god attaches name through will redeem man
strikes israel therefore engages himself battle god reason history israel fulcrum human history
suffering others must therefore seen light israel’s suffering
travail man abandoned precisely because israel suffers thereby god’s presence drawn human history redemption enters horizon human existence
focusing fackenheim's conception jewish identity zionism renowned scholar daniel shoag presents critique view within jewish community harvard israel review while fackenheim's sentiments need jewish self-reliance form jewish state immensely popular fackenheim fails locate religious divine source moral imperative
fackenheim self-defense manifestation zionism religious values rather things precede religious value stand outside
thus fackenheim locates significance jewish state holocaust rather traditional judaism
perhaps strongest rejection fackenheim's idea 614 th commandment comes rabbi harold m
schulweiss abuse holocaust becomes cudgel against others their claims suffering
shoah must misused contest one-downsmanship other victims brutality
shoah become our instant raison d'etre short-cut answer penetrating questions our children 'why should marry out faith? why should join synagogue? why should support israel? why should jewish?' relied singular imperative 'thou shalt give hitler posthumous victory
answer will work
live spite say 'no' hitler far cry living 'yes' judaism
rabbi michael goldberg developed sort criticism book why should jews survive? looking past holocaust toward jewish future
conclusion during fackenheim's last interview 2000 confronted question you think israel ever come point doesn’t state resistance? think will very long time
will time ever come say hitler's shadow gone? think yes will come israel accepted peace neighbor states
doesn’t look like will happen soon
there few survivors holocaust 2005[update] many feel their memories opinions deserve respect
idea people must further hitler's goals become meaningful part public discourse judaism zionism anti-semitism many discuss sympathetically embrace wholeheartedly
newer generations understand holocaust history feel injunction grant hitler no posthumous victories denies positive interpretations subjects addresses
preceding discussion rich does begin justice fackenheim's achievements teaching professor scholar philosophy years professor kantian hegelian german idealistic philosophy university toronto — above scholar hegel nor does justice oft expressed indebtedness leo strauss fackenheim exemplar means jew pursue philosophic vocation times live
those interested fackenheim's contribution understanding how strictly rationalist philosophizing must part crown jewish existence our time worth pondering leo strauss's judgment fackenheim's book hegel — religious dimension hegel's thought 1967 — strongest alternative kojève's atheistic interpretation hegel
