finally gobineau whites best greatest three races whites whites alone ones capable intelligent thought physically most beautiful ones capable creating beauty
gobineau white race originally possessed monopoly beauty intelligence strength whatever positive qualities asians blacks possessed due subsequent miscegenation

gobineau's contempt ordinary people seen letters preferred term common folk boue mud
gobineau questioned belief black yellow races belong same human family white race share common ancestor

essay inequality human races ultimately accepts prevailing christian doctrine human beings shared common ancestors adam eve monogenism opposed polygenism
suggested nothing proves first redaction adamite genealogies colored races considered forming part species may conclude power producing fertile offspring among marks distinct species
nothing leads us believe human race outside rule there no answer argument
gobineau believed white race superior other races creation civilized culture maintenance ordered government
american historian geoffrey field summarized gobineau's work written after revolutions 1848-49 essai post-mortem old aristocratic order europe characterized reverence hierarchy social status family lineage
superior beauty intellect creative vigor white race especially illustrious aryan branch bearer culture civilization responsible triumphs past
process civilization inevitably involved miscegenation inferior breeds leading slow debilitation noble race over centuries
gobineau history revealed tragic fall man presumed racial purity degenerate condition racial corruption mongrelization
pockets aryan blood remained especially among nobility decline inevitable irreversible
contemporary society argued gobineau offered abundant proof conclusions
revolutionary convulsions false egalitarian democratic ideals selfish materialism bourgeoisie phlegmatic response nobility these challenges inescapable symptoms depravity
france exhausted britain being slowly corrupted liberalism while michael biddiss shown gobineau no means sympathetic towards prussia
anything last years viewed process decay accelerating cold objectivist ironical tone depicted global crisis vision racial doom
gobineau thought development civilization other periods different own speculated other races might superior qualities those civilizations
believed european civilization represented best remained ancient civilizations held most superior attributes capable continued survival
primary thesis european civilization flowed greece rome then germanic contemporary civilization
thought corresponded ancient indo-european culture also known aryan included groups classified language example celts slavs germans

like other many other racists gobineau believed one's looks determined other words beautiful people created beautiful art while ugly people created ugly art
gobineau's theory major influence national socialist aesthetes
1970 american historian gerhard weinberg summarized up nazi view relationship race art cultural accomplishments civilizations product their racial composition-the great artists renaissance times nordics whose works reflect their own appearance while monstrosities modern art mirror appearances their creators
botticelli must slim famous venus rubens must corpulent figures painted picasso presumably three eyes
anyone considers summary unfair urged examine paul schultze-naumburg's kunst und rasse munich lehmann 1928 1935 since illustrations convey message anyone does read german
british sinologist arnold rowbotham gobineau superiority aryan totally amoral superiority gobineau's aryan heroes might right
gobineau aryans their original pure state whatever liked because superior anyone else no external morality
rowbotham gobineau's aryan theories stripped racial mysticism makes force virtue even necessity
carried logical conclusion mean return barbarism gobineau least implies arts civilization non-aryan least result race-mixing
gobineau originally given past trajectory civilization europe white race miscegenation inevitable result growing chaos
despite claims whites most beautiful races gobineau believed somewhat contradictory asian black women immense powers sexual attraction over white men reasons never explained gobineau attribute asian black men same sexual powers attributed black asian women whenever whites close proximity blacks asians result miscegenation white men seduced asian black women determent whites

gobineau attributed much economic turmoil france pollution races
later life spread british american civilization growth germany altered opinion believe white race saved
wagner fascinated gobineau's racial theories much writings 1876 onwards showed gobineau's influence
field gobineau's chief work essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines contained far detailed closely argued explanation cultural decadence anything wagner written
indeed synthesis anthropology theology linguistics history unquestionably most impressive ideologically coherent racial analysis produced pre-darwinian era
german-born american historian george mosse argued gobineau projected fears hatreds french middle class working class onto asians blacks
summarizing mosse's argument davies argued self-serving materialistic oriental essai really anti-capitalist's portrait money-grubbing french middle class
while sensual unintelligent violent negro gobineau portrayed essai aristocratic caricature french poor
writings french peasantry gobineau characteristically insisted numerous anecdotes claimed based personal experience french farmers coarse crude people incapable learning indeed any sort thinking beyond most rudimentary level thought american critic michelle wright peasant may inhabit land certainly part

translators two american race scientists josiah c
nott henry hotze both ardent white supremacists nott also described work niggerogy champions slavery found gobineau's anti-black writings convenient justification peculiar institution
nott hotz found much approve essai such passages like following gobineau negro most humble lags bottom scale
animal character imprinted upon brow marks destiny moment conception
much gobineau's intense annoyance nott hotze abridged first volume essai 600 pages french original down mere 400 english
least part why hotze nott cut out much because gobineau's hostile picture americans
white american people gobineau declared essai very mixed assortment most degenerate races olden-day europe
human flotsam ages
irish crossbreed germans french italians even doubtful stock
intermixture these decadent ethnic varieties will inevitably give birth further ethnic chaos
chaos no way unexpected new will produce no further ethnic mixture already cannot realized our own continent
absolutely nothing productive will result even ethnic combinations resulting infinite unions germans irish italians french anglo-saxons join us south racial elements composed indian negro spanish portuguese essence quite unimaginable anything result such horrible confusions incoherent juxtapositions most decadent kinds people
passages like above highly critical white americans removed nott hotze moral intellectual diversity races essai titled english retained parts relating alleged inherent inferiority blacks
likewise nott hotze used gobineau way attempting establish white america fact mortal peril despite fact vast majority american blacks slaves 1856 two race scientists argued basis essai blacks essentially type vicious animal rather human beings pose danger whites
passages essai gobineau declared through low intelligence blacks certain artistic talents few exceptional african tribal chiefs probably higher iq stupidest whites included american edition nott hotze want nothing might even slightest give blacks admirable human qualities
beyond nott hotz claimed nation race same american white
such american translators argued their introduction just various european nations torn apart nationality conflicts caused different races living together likewise ending slavery granting american citizenship blacks cause same sort conflicts much vaster scale united states
1859 anglo-french dispute over french fishing rights over french shore newfoundland led anglo-french commission being sent newfoundland find resolution dispute
gobineau two french commissioners dispatched newfoundland experience later recorded 1861 book voyage à terre-neuve voyage newfoundland
1858 foreign minister count alexandre colonna-walewski tried sent gobineau french legation beijing gobineau objected civilized european no wish go asian country like china
punishment walewski sent gobineau newfoundland telling fired quai d'orsay refused newfoundland assignment
gobineau hated newfoundland writing friend paris july 1859 awful country
very cold there almost constant fog sails pieces floating ice enormous size
while newfoundland gobineau described several remote fishing settlements visited utopian terms praising them examples how few hardy tough people make living under very inhospitable conditions
gobineau's praise newfoundland fishermen reflected fact viewed them survivals less pure aryans triumphing over harsh climate while also reflecting viewpoint those cut themselves off society best preserve their purity
contrast gobineau dispatches back paris condemned recruiting methods british royal navy based upon offering financial rewards sailors enlisted reflecting vulgar crude crass materialism british people both britain even british north america while praised recruiting methods french imperial navy based appeals french patriotism reflecting spiritual strength french people gobineau believed les anglo-saxons further down road racial decline french
gobineau particular stuck way newspapers halifax condemned royal navy offering generous signing up bonuses sailors major problem forced local ship-owners offer higher wages their sailors prevent them joining navy gobineau used argue nova scotians utterly materialistic
time st
john's city largely inhabited irish immigrants gobineau deployed virtually every anti-irish cliché reports paris stating irish st
john's extremely poor undisciplined conniving obstreperous dishonest loud violent usually drunk
besides touring newfoundland gobineau paid visit labourer hunt caribou experience provided basis autobiographical 1871 short story chasse au caribou caribou hunt
during time labourer gobineau encountered first nations peoples whom disparagingly called les sauvages savages
based upon visits newfoundland nova scotia gassendi french navy ship gobineau travelling visited halifax pick up coal gobineau reached conclusion almost people north america hopelessly materialistic western civilization existed europe
gobineau argued chinese civilization created group aryan conquerors india brought under their heel indigenous malay people living there
through gobineau read virtually everything written french china believed origins chinese civilization southern china posited aryans india first arrived rather yellow river valley chinese sources regard cradle chinese civilization
gobineau argued aryans being conquering elite taken masculine rather feminine approach establishing their rule
turn led peaceful despotism well suited malay disposition based servility state capacity grasp advantages regular co-ordinated state organization obsession exclusively material well-being
through gobineau argued chinese able make progress under influence their aryan elite ultimately miscegenation led elite being assimilated yellow majority thus chinese capable making any further progress
gobineau crucial moment occurred 246 bc qin shi huang first emperor unified chinese states
gobineau argued qin destroyed feudal system created ancient aryan conquerors replaced imperial leveling ended aryan elite gobineau there innovation great nonetheless itself last trace independence personal dignity understood aryan manner disappeared forever before definitive invasions yellow type [l'espèce jaune]
such gobineau argued chinese static people incapable change essentially nothing significant occurred china since 246 bc time
furthermore gobineau argued chinese fundamentally materialist people devoid any sort spirituality
gobineau argued chinese ideal gentleman scholar supreme example chinese man should like while same time low social prestige soldiers within china reflected gobineau disparaging saw materialist ordination chinese
contrast gobineau argued aryans first foremost warriors gobineau approvingly explained why soldiers such high social prestige europe
gobineau contempt because their materialism chinese happiness found via having sufficient food keep oneself alive sufficient clothing avoid public nudity
gobineau believe freedom press believed ordinary people needed monitored state argued freedom press possible china because exclusively utilitarian nature chinese meant unlike west there no-one china willing fight die their ideas
gobineau long chinese population well provided no chinese bother confront police truncheons greater glory political abstraction
along same lines gobineau dismissive chinese culture argued without beauty dignity
gobineau chinese lacking sentiments beyond humblest notion physical utility chinese confucianism resume practices maxims strongly reminiscent moralists geneva their educational books pleased recommend nec plus ultra good economy moderation prudence art making profit never loss
gobineau stationed geneva early diplomatic career during time there developed intense visceral hatred swiss middle class calvinism swiss democracy attempt associate confucian values calvinist values definitely meant insult both
gobineau chinese literature puerile chinese lacked powers imagination allowed westerners write great novels chinese theater flat chinese poetry ridiculous
gobineau declared great chinese scientific works verbose compilations lacking analytic rigor gobineau stated whites alone capable achieving
gobineau asserted chinese incapable science because spirit yellow race neither profound nor insightful attain quality [scientific excellence] reserved white race
gobineau believed china warning west perils democracy-by gobineau meant meritocracy
gobineau argued because chinese state attempted promote education masses rule mandarins meritocratic exams become mandarin open literate men reflected racially stagnant character chinese
gobineau believed best form government existed ancien régime france rule hereditary aristocratic elite ordered hierarchical society
such gobineau extremely opposed classical liberalism celebration meritocracy used example china warning classical liberals taking west towards
gobineau supposed destruction aryan elite qin 246 bc fact absolutely similar took place chez nous 1789 innovating spirit saw first necessity destruction ancient territorial subdivisions [of france]
demands classical liberals universal education gobineau popular education everywhere promoted emphasis well-being subjects complete liberty allotted sphere fullest industrial agricultural development production most modest prices rendering european competition difficult ordinary necessities life like cotton silk pottery
these incontestable results chinese system boast
later essay criticizing third republic gobineau most people republic meant chimera liberty via rule merit given equal chances rise through their abilities
gobineau contemptuously principle 1789 no different rule mandarins china predicated republic continued exist long enough french degenerate down same level chinese
paradoxically although gobineau saw hope expansion european power support creation commercial empires their attendant multicultural milieu
concluded development empires ultimately destructive superior races created them since led mixing distinct races
instead saw later period 19 th century imperialism degenerative process european civilization
continually referred past empires europe their attendant movement non-white peoples european homelands explaining ethnography nations europe
according theories mixed populations spain most france italy most southern germany most switzerland austria parts britain derived historical development roman greek ottoman empires brought non-aryan peoples africa mediterranean cultures western northern europe
believed populations southern western iran southern spain italy consisted degenerative race arising miscegenation whole north india consisted yellow asian race
gobineau extremely hostile towards slavic peoples especially russians claimed result miscegenation under golden horde become semi-asian people
slavs general gobineau stagnant marsh superior ethnic strains after few hours triumph found themselves engulfed
besides promoting racism gobineau also several well received novels
native france gobineau still often praised literary critics master french style whose novels written elegant verve superb sense irony
french critic pierre-louis rey british historian michael
biddiss both decried tendency part french critics sever gobineau racist gobineau novelist maintaining gobineau's novels just much reflect racial theories does essai
gobineau's 1874 novel les pléiades concerned few exceptionally talented people examples ethnic persistence europe surrounded vast masses morons
introduction les pléiades gobineau stated purpose novel advance theory there no longer classes there no longer peoples only-in whole europe-certain individuals float like wreckage upon flood
les pléiades selected few flee modern france fictional country burbach located somewhere central europe attempt maintain purity their blood while half-sadly half-contently watch destruction european civilization safety burbach
throughout les pléiades ordinary people described variously fools scoundrels brutes whom gobineau likens animals
1877 novel renaissance gobineau again highlights theme few gifted aryan heroes such cesare borgia pope julius ii having misfortune being surrounded endless multitude debased inferiors
renaissance gobineau attacked entire idea morality basis action arguing superior few should governed any set universal moral values
such pope alexander vi presented hero renaissance precisely because utterly ruthless way advanced interests borgia family defiance morality
renaissance gobineau alexander tell lucretia borgia kind person whom destiny calls dominate others ordinary rules life reversed duty becomes quite different
good evil transferred another higher plane
biddiss gobineau's philosophy utter dehumanization weak glorification strong making gobineau incipient fascist thesis amoral violence completely acceptable committed aryan elite
biddiss argued impossible sever gobineau racist gobineau novelist several french critics attempted everything gobineau expression same philosophy
after reading essai de tocqueville gobineau alone europe germans
provide you really favorable audience
1874 gobineau met homosexual german diplomat prince philip von eulenburg stockholm become very close
eulenburg later fondly recall how gobineau spent hours during their time sweden under nordic sky old world gods lived customs habits people well their hearts
gobineau turn later write two people entire world ever properly understood racist philosophy namely wagner eulenburg
gobineau encouraged eulenburg promote theory aryan master-race telling way you will help many people understand things sooner
later eulenburg complain letters gobineau destroyed because “they contain too much intimately personal nature”
1879 gobineau attempted prove own racial superiority over rest french pseudo-family history historie de ottar jarl pirate norvégien conquérant du pays de bray en normandie et de sa descendance history ottar jarl norwegian pirate conqueror normandy descendants begins line descend odin traces gobineau's supposed descent viking ottar jarl gobineau triumphantly meant aryan descent
after becoming associated wagner after meeting 1876 rome many ideas incorporated wagner's later operas
cosima wagner gobineau may 1881 tell my husband quite your service reading races work staging
gobineau back say assure you there no bayreuthian faithful
wagner while accepting basic ideas gobineau's philosophy rejected gobineau's pessimism fate aryans
instead wagner created concept regeneration aryans return their former glory embracing theories art rejecting wagner called corrupting influence jews
1894 wagnerite anti-semitic journalist ludwig schemann founded gobineau vereinigung gobineau society promote gobineau's theories germany
gobineau vereinigung small group exercised much intellectual influence way much popularize theory aryan master-race germany
gobineauismus schemann gobineau vereinigung promoted owed much wagner gobineau gobineau vereinigung rejected gobineau's pessimism claimed aryan race saved
last years life gobineau consumed fear later known yellow peril-believing european civilization soon destroyed chinese invasion
1881 gobineau published article richard wagner's newspaper bayreuther blätter entitled ein urteil über die jetzige weltage translated german cosima wagner whose introduction written her husband warning chinese soon overwhelm destroy western civilization
gobineau praised racist laws meant restrict chinese immigration united states canada new zealand hawaii australia good first step warned european civilization rotten miscegenation matter time before chinese destroyed west
gobineau gave artistic expression vision 1881 epic poem amadis small elite aryan aristocrats ruling europe threatened revolt racially inferior commoners allows chinese invade europe despite fact aryan heroes superior every respect chinese horde aryans finally overwhelmed sheer force numbers exterminated
amadis extermination aryans marks destruction everything good world beginning new dark age
1884 french efforts conquer vietnam led war breaking out france china
sino-french war led immediate revival interest gobineau's anti-asian writings france several french newspapers reprinted french original gobineau's 1881 article bayreuther blätter together translation wagner's introduction warning imminent chinese threat european civilization
likewise franco-chinese war led essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines becoming popular france
book published four volumes each 000 pages long 1853-55 remained out print decades
1884 just after war china began second edition third editions essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines published paris direct result war many french people suddenly become interested book such unflattering picture asians
american historian gregory blue gobineau china deadly soulless menace white race merciless agent impeding destruction everything good world
nazism adolf hitler nazism borrowed much gobineau's ideology
however although central figure development degeneration theory gobineau antisemitic may characterised philosemitic having written very positively jewish people including long eulogy them essai sur l'inégalité des races describing them free strong intelligent people succeeded despite natural disadvantages land israel
later years however inclined according paul lawrence rose toward vague personal antisemitism
nazis adopted gobineau's theories edited work extensively make conform their views much case nietzsche
gobineau's theories major influence romanian radical anti-semitic politician professor
cuza embraced gobineau's biological racism way proving jews plague upon modern romanian life
like most gobineau's followers cuza rejected pessimism too extreme cuza argued romanian people formed out fusion ancient dacians romans best preserved aryan blood jews biologically different people simply belong romania
cuza deeply impressed gobineau often used gobineau's theories rhetoric racial degeneration frame anti-semitic arguments jewish race
cuza frequently claimed jews plague upon romania cuza asserted romanian people midst sort racial degeneration described gobineau cuza naturally caused jews
late writings richard wagner positive gobineau suggested exclude correctness racial theory
same time also totally disagreed gobineau's conclusion miscegenation unavoidably resulted decline human race cultures
thought christ died everyone irrespective race drew hope fundamental regeneration
cosima wagner maintained close contact gobineau wagner himself
gobineau visited bayreuth home wagner shortly before death
