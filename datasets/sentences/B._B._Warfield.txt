views bible during tenure primary thrust seminary authoritative view bible
view held contrast emotionalism revival movements rationalism higher criticism heterodox teachings various new religious movements emerging
seminary held fast reformed confessional tradition — faithfully followed westminster confession faith
warfield believed modernist theology problematic since relied upon thoughts biblical interpreter rather upon divine author scripture
therefore preached believed doctrine sola scriptura — bible god's inspired word sufficient christian live her faith
much warfield's work centered upon bible's inspiration god — while authors bible men ultimate author god himself
growing influence modernist theology denied bible inspired alternative theories origin christian faith being explored
after comparing grammatical linguistic styles found within bible itself modernist scholars suggested because human authors clearly contributed writing biblical text bible written people alone god
warfield central figure responding line thinking arguing supernatural work holy spirit lead form mechanical inspiration whereby human authors merely down god dictated them similar story qur'an's inspiration human author's intellect fully able express itself linguistically while same time being supervised holy spirit ensure inspiration
approach essential understanding view inspiration held many reformed evangelical christians today
studies religious experience warfield conservative critic much religious revivalism popular america time
believed teachings experience movement too subjective therefore too shallow deep christian faith
book counterfeit miracles advocated cessationism over against miracles after time apostles
such attacks go unnoticed even today warfield criticized proponents revivalism pentecostal charismatic movements
example jack deere surprised power spirit intention refuting counterfeit miracles
warfield's book published before worldwide spread pentecostalism addressed issue claims possession miraculous gifts under headings patristic mediǣval marvels roman catholic miracles irvingite gifts faith-healing mind-cure
book perfectionism detailed critique saw false theories sanctification
includes analysis higher life movement keswick movement well rebuttal earlier schools thought such asa mahan oberlin college particular theology charles grandison finney
calvinism underpinning much warfield's theology adherence calvinism espoused westminster confession faith
sometimes forgotten battles against modernism hand against revivalism other simply expressing reformed faith applied certain situations
warfield's belief 16 th century reformers well 17 th century confessional writers merely summarizing content application scripture
new revelations whether minds celebrated scholars popular revivalists therefore inconsistent these confessional statements therefore inconsistent scripture
throughout ministry warfield contended modern world events thinking never render such confessions obsolete
such attitude still prevails today many reformed churches christians embrace calvinism
calvinism just religion purity
therefore conceive religion purity calvinism

theologian fred g
zaspel argues these statements led livingstone noll assume too much warfield's views subject
zaspel writes warfield actually committed himself doctrine evolution seems impossible affirm simply because although there indications entertained idea never admits accepting
warfield studied charles darwin's religious views
article darwin's religious life concluded darwin's doctrine evolution directly expelled darwin's christian belief
warfield writes thus doctrine evolution once heartily adopted darwin gradually undermined faith until cast off whole christianity unproven delusion
warfield believe evolution required such rejection faith
1889 review life letters charles darwin included statement there many evolutionists remained theists christians
1915 article calvin's doctrine creation warfield should scarcely passed without remark calvin's doctrine creation understood aright except souls men evolutionary
'indigested mass' including 'promise potency' yet called being simple fiat god
come being since- except souls men alone - arisen modification original world-stuff means interaction intrinsic forces
these forces apart god course
further says concerns us here [calvin] ascribed entire series modifications primal 'indigested mass' called 'heaven earth' passed form ordered world see including origination forms life vegetable animal alike inclusive doubtless bodily form man second causes their proximate account
say very pure evolutionary scheme
warfield also points out calvin doubtless no theory whatsoever evolution teaches doctrine evolution

calvin accordingly very naturally thought along lines theistic evolutionism

warfield church politics unlike contemporaries princeton perhaps due invalid wife warfield never cared much churchmanship
