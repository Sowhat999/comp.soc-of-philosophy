writings historia plantarum 1549 lists diogenes laërtius giving 227 titles appears activity theophrastus extended over whole field contemporary knowledge
writing probably differed little aristotle's treatment same themes though supplementary details
like aristotle most writings lost works
thus theophrastus like aristotle composed first second analytic ἀναλυτικῶν προτέρων ἀναλυτικῶν ὑστέρων
also written books topics ἀνηγμένων τόπων τοπικῶν τὰ πρὸ τῶν τόπων analysis syllogisms περὶ ἀναλύσεως συλλογισμῶν περὶ συλλογισμῶν λύσεως sophisms σοφισμάτων affirmation denial περὶ καταφάσεως καὶ ἀποφάσεως well natural philosophy περὶ φύσεως περὶ φυσικῶν φυσικῶν others heaven περὶ οὐρανοῦ meteorological phenomena τῆς μεταρσιολεσχίας μεταρσιολογικῶν

main efforts continue labours aristotle natural history

also oratory poetry
theophrastus without doubt departed further aristotle ethical writings also metaphysical investigations motion soul god
besides these writings theophrastus several collections problems out things least passed problems come down us under name aristotle commentaries partly dialogues probably belonged erotikos ἐρωτικός megacles μεγακλῆς callisthenes καλλισθένης megarikos μεγαρικός letters partly books mathematical sciences their history

there no literary charm sentences mostly compressed highly elliptical point sometimes obscurity

plants frankincense trees dhufar main article historia plantarum theophrastus most important books two large botanical treatises enquiry plants περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία causes plants περὶ φυτῶν αἰτιῶν constitute most important contribution botanical science during antiquity middle ages first systemization botanical world strength these works following linnaeus call father botany
enquiry plants originally ten books nine survive
work arranged system whereby plants classified according their modes generation their localities their sizes according their practical uses such foods juices herbs etc
first book deals parts plants second book reproduction plants times manner sowing third fourth fifth books devoted trees their types their locations their practical applications sixth book deals shrubs spiny plants seventh book deals herbs eighth book deals plants produce edible seeds ninth book deals plants produce useful juices gums resins etc
cinnamomum verum köhler's medicinal plants 1887 causes plants originally eight books six survive
concerns growth plants influences their fecundity proper times should sown reaped methods preparing soil manuring use tools smells tastes properties many types plants
work deals mainly economical uses plants rather their medicinal uses although latter sometimes mentioned
although these works contain many absurd fabulous statements include valuable observations concerning functions properties plants
theophrastus detected process germination realized importance climate soil plants
much information greek plants may come own observations known travelled throughout greece botanical garden own works also profit reports plants asia brought back those followed alexander great reports alexander's followers owed accounts such plants cotton-plant banyan pepper cinnamon myrrh frankincense

there no reason assigning work other author because noticed hermippus andronicus especially nicolaus damascus already mentioned
stones cut emeralds treatise stones περὶ λίθων used source other lapidaries until least renaissance theophrastus classified rocks gems based their behavior heated further grouping minerals common properties such amber magnetite both power attraction
also comments effect heat minerals their different hardnesses
theophrastus describes different marbles mentions coal says used heating metal-workers describes various metal ores knew pumice-stones volcanic origin
also deals precious stones emeralds amethysts onyx jasper etc
describes variety sapphire blue veins gold thus presumably lapis-lazuli
knew pearls came shell-fish coral came india speaks fossilized remains organic life
theophrastus made first known reference phenomenon pyroelectricity noting mineral tourmaline becomes charged heated
also considers practical uses various stones such minerals necessary manufacture glass production various pigments paint such ochre manufacture plaster
discusses use touchstone assaying gold gold alloys important property require genius archimedes resolve quantitative detail asked investigate suspected debasement crown few years later
many rarer minerals found mines mentions famous copper mines cyprus even famous silver mines presumably laurium near athens upon wealth city based well referring gold mines
laurium silver mines property state usually leased fixed sum percentage working
towards end fifth century output fell partly owing spartan occupation decelea
mines continued worked though strabo records time tailings being worked over pausanias speaks mines thing past
ancient workings consisting shafts galleries excavating ore washing tables extracting metal may still seen
theophrastus separate work mining like most writings lost work
pliny elder makes clear references use stones naturalis historia 77 ad while updating making much new information available minerals himself
although pliny's treatment subject extensive theophrastus systematic work comparatively free fable magic although describe lyngurium gemstone supposedly formed solidified urine lynx best ones coming wild males included many lapidiaries until gradually disappeared view 17 th century
both these early texts emerge science mineralogy ultimately geology
pliny especially observant crystal habit mineral hardness example
philosophy theophrastus depicted medieval scholar nuremberg chronicle extent theophrastus followed aristotle's doctrines defined them accurately conceived them different form additional structures thought placed upon them partially determined because loss many writings
many opinions reconstructed works later writers such alexander aphrodisias simplicius
logic theophrastus seems carried out still further grammatical foundation logic rhetoric since book elements speech distinguished main parts speech subordinate parts also direct expressions κυρία λέξις kuria lexis metaphorical expressions dealt emotions πάθη pathe speech
further distinguished twofold reference speech σχίσις schisis things πράγματα pragmata hearers referred poetry rhetoric latter
length unity judgment different kinds negation difference unconditional conditional necessity
doctrine syllogisms brought forward proof conversion universal affirmative judgments differed aristotle here there laying down arranging modi syllogisms partly proof them partly doctrine mixture
influence modality premises upon modality conclusion
then two separate works dealt reduction arguments syllogistic form resolution them further hypothetical conclusions
doctrine proof galen quotes second analytic theophrastus conjunction aristotle best treatises doctrine
different monographs seems tried expand general theory science
too may belonged proposition quoted topics principles opposites themselves opposed cannot deduced same higher genus
rest minor deviations aristotelian definitions quoted topica theophrastus
closely connected treatise upon ambiguous words ideas without doubt corresponded book ε aristotle's metaphysics
physics metaphysics theophrastus introduced physics proof natural existence being corporeal composite requires principles first foremost motion basis change
denying substance space seems regarded opposition aristotle mere arrangement position taxis thesis bodies
time called accident motion without seems viewing aristotle numerical determinant motion
attacked doctrine four classical elements challenged whether fire called primary element appears compound requiring does another material own nutriment
aristotle departed widely aristotle doctrine motion since hand extended over categories limit those laid down aristotle
viewed motion aristotle activity carrying own goal itself ateles potentially exists opposed aristotle's view motion required special explanation regarded something proper both nature general celestial system particular surely then life animals does need explanation explained way may case heavens too heavenly bodies movement does need explanation explained special way?— theophrastus metaphysics 10
recognised no activity without motion referred activities soul motion desires emotions corporeal motion judgment kriseis contemplation spiritual motion
idea spirit entirely independent organic activity must therefore appeared very doubtful yet appears contented himself developing doubts difficulties point without positively rejecting
other peripatetics like dicaearchus aristoxenus especially strato developed further naturalism aristotelian doctrine
theophrastus seems generally speaking investigation overstepped limits experience preferred develop difficulties rather solve them especially apparent metaphysics
doubtful aristotle's teleology recommended such ideas used caution regard view things sake end nothing vain assignation ends general easy usually stated
must set certain limits purposiveness effort after best assert exist cases without qualification

follow incessant attempts aristotle refer phenomena their ultimate foundations attempts unfold internal connections latter them phenomena
antiquity subject complaint theophrastus expressed himself precision consistency respecting god understood time heaven another enlivening breath pneuma
ethics bust inscribed θεόφραστος μελάντα ἐρέσιος theophrastos melanta eresios theophrastus allow happiness resting merely upon virtue consequently hold fast unconditional value morality
subordinated moral requirements advantage least friend allowed prosperity existence influence injurious them
later times fault found expression callisthenes life ruled fortune wisdom vitam regit fortuna non sapientia
definition pleasure likewise coincide aristotle seems indicated titles two writings dealt pleasure generally other pleasure aristotle defined
although like teacher preferred contemplative theoretical active practical life preferred set latter free restraints family life etc
manner aristotle approved
theophrastus opposed eating meat grounds robbed animals life therefore unjust
