unconventional mentor also taught njegoš sports shooting sword-fighting
reign historical background montenegro 1830 nineteenth-century montenegrin society quite primitive even contemporary standards
foreigners viewed suspicion merchants widely seen money grubbing effete
wars montenegrins neighbouring muslim tribes too common cattle rustling banditry headhunting
men devoted much their energy incessant blood feuds limiting effectiveness montenegrin resistance turks
[nb 4] most physical labour done women entertainment consisted contests exhibiting feats strength evenings spent listening songs recounting heroic exploits accompaniment gusle
before 19 th century western montenegro nothing cluster feuding tribes presided over metropolitans cetinje
montenegrin territory consisted four small districts turkish nahiye most important katuni nahiya nine tribes cetinje njeguši ćeklići bjelice cuce čevo pješivci zagarač komani
these areas de facto independent ottoman empire since treaty passarowitz 1718 though elements self-governance existed since earliest days turkish rule 15 th century
decades ottoman authorities treated inhabitants western montenegro eastern herzegovina unsubjected filuricis obligated pay fixed amount florentine ducats florin ottomans each year
such taxation increase wealth size one's household serbs these regions completely exempt ottoman poll tax other levies usually paid christian subjects sublime porte
though privileges granted highlanders meant allay public dissatisfaction these poor strategically vital regions venetian border late 16 th century ended up having opposite effect
serbs began shunning ottoman tax collectors entirely ottomans attempted impose taxes normally paid other christian subjects serbs revolted carved out their own autonomous region
absence ottoman authority produced ideal opportunity tribalism flourish
thousands serbs remained ottoman-held territory converted islam avoid paying these newly imposed taxes
converts granted full rights privileges muslim subjects sultan while non-muslims viewed second-class subjects treated such
hence christians viewed converts derision considered them traitors faith their forefathers
religious killings common times war since both christians muslims considered members opposing faith apostates worthy death
although montenegrin warriors often attributed their country's survival independent entity their own military prowess journalist tim judah notes turks often saw little point expending blood resources trying subdue impoverished sliver land controlled montenegrin chieftains
far ottomans concerned montenegrins rebellious infidels wished plunder property their prosperous muslim neighbours possessed
throughout 18 th century thousands montenegrins left their homeland migrated serbia hope finding fertile fields raise their crops
authority became centralized after petar came power 1782
1796 petar initiated war against kara mahmud bushati vizier pashalik scutari reinforced montenegro's autonomy resulted large territorial gains ottomans' expense
two years later council tribal chiefs met cetinje agreed compose code laws form central court known kuluk both administrative judicial functions
despite these accomplishments petar little success unifying disparate montenegrin tribes impossible form stable government organize army unless taxes levied tribes no willing pay taxes cetinje ottomans
attempts stop their raiding looting equally futile attempts keep them feuding another
1830 montenegro boasted handful literate citizens yet seen western world bastion christian resistance turks
country's economic situation remained dire borders still internationally recognized turks continued claim part their empire
accession njegoš succeeded uncle petar ruler
petar i's final years defined deteriorating health continuing inability find successor—ideally both petrović literate monk—capable carrying role
petar's first candidate mitar m
petrović son eldest brother stjepan
within several years younger petrović died petar forced find different successor
turned attention đorđije s
petrović middle brother's son
đorđije illiterate petar sent saint petersburg attend school
once there đorđije realized preferred living russia over montenegro
1828 sent uncle letter saint petersburg informing wished enroll imperial russian army asking relieved succession
1829 petar informed jeremija gagić ethnic serb served russian vice-consul dubrovnik charge russia's dealings montenegro đorđije permission enter russian military depriving right throne
then petar entertained possibility extending throne teenaged njegoš took steps further education
seventeen-year-old again sent cetinje monastery mentored seminary
petar then introduced state matters trusting writing official letters orders behalf
died old age 30 october [o
19 october] 1830 without having publicly named successor
prior death elderly vladika dictated will testament njegoš's old mentor milutinović named njegoš successor granted ecclesiastical secular powers
will also cursed anyone trampled over montenegro's traditional bonds russia exchange better relations austria swearing leprosy strike them down
montenegrins hostile petrović clan alleged milutinović fabricated document order make njegoš vladika pointing their close friendship proof
several scholars raised possibility will indeed forgery though most modern historians believe genuine
day after petar's death montenegro's chieftains met cetinje confirm new vladika
according account there several chieftains wish see njegoš bestowed title
considered too young inexperienced disliked haste coronated
figures such milutinović stanko s
petrović iguman mojsije zečević serdar mikhail bošković headman čevo stefan vukotić supported njegoš's bid urged council immediately proclaim next vladika
first recognize such archimandrite ostrog josif pavičević followed guvernadur governor montenegro vukolaj vuko radonjić other chieftains
another account holds radonjić hotly opposed njegoš's succession argued expatriated đorđije petar i's true heir
reason behind radonjić's opposition njegoš lay fact clan radonjićes bitter enemies njegoš's petrović clan
apparently radonjić's opinion sway chieftains composed declaration proclaiming njegoš next vladika
according account archimandrite josif signed declaration first radonjić signed last after seeing other chieftains done
despite having any formal training monk teenaged njegoš soon consecrated archimandrite himself
adopted ecclesiastical name petar honour late predecessor thus becoming known petar ii petrović-njegoš
following consecration signed himself using monkish name surname
thus njegoš's correspondences signed under name petar petrović though montenegrin people continued refer given name affectionately called bishop rade
most scholarly texts referred simply njegoš
crushing dissent 1830–32 whispers conspiracy vukolaj vuko radonjić head radonjić clan njegoš's main opponent during first months power
radonjićes traditionally opposed montenegro's close ties russia advocating closer relationship austria instead
pro-austrian orientation dated fall venetian republic 1797 austria annexed venice's possessions established land border montenegro
radonjićes then became leading pro-austrian clan frequently made contact austrian agents bay kotor montenegrin frontier
vuko radonjić's conflict njegoš took both personal political dimension because their clans traditional rivals because petrovićes ardently pro-russian largely due ecclesiastical ties vladika russian holy synod
guvernadur radonjić occupied position meant exclusively radonjićes just post vladika held petrović
office guvernadur dated back 1715 venetian senate created title supreme vojvoda duke share power vladika montenegro
venetians titled governattore became guvernadur montenegrin dialect
although jurisdiction guvernadur never clearly defined radonjićes their supporters regularly claimed powers equal vladika while petrovićes their supporters argued vladika final say montenegrin affairs
now njegoš poised take throne radonjić began claiming superiority office attempted attain full control over secular affairs
late november 1830 radonjić vice-consul gagić dubrovnik complaining cetinje's inability hold tribes together anarchy sweeping through countryside

18 november]
divested power stripped titles gubernatorial seal symbol office taken away
noon council decided guilty treason condemned death firing squad alongside brother marko co-conspirator
[nb 5] radonjić failed win over chieftains historian barbara jelavich asserts vast majority chiefs backed petrovićes solely because saw ecclesiastical leader like njegoš posing less threat their own power
chieftains later report gagić explaining radonjić brother shot because [they] dared make secret arrangements imperialists surrender independence montenegro austria
other radonjićes forced exile
several weeks later njegoš commuted radonjić's sentence well-timed display clemency first life imprisonment then exile
radonjić's youngest brother djuzo fortunate ambushed close friend day family's slava patron saint day killed
many other radonjićes also met violent ends either being killed raids driven out their families after their villages torched
1831 milutinović now njegoš's personal secretary also forced exile after entering disagreement young vladika
weeks before forced exile njegoš become very critical old mentor frequently pointed out shortcomings before others
milutinović given permission return shortly afterwards understanding their relationship young man's terms

establishment governing senate cetinje monastery beginning njegoš' reign marked revival montenegro's traditional alliance russia
relationship two countries motivated montenegrins' need powerful ally provide political financial support their fledgling nation russia's desire exploit montenegro's strategic location ongoing geopolitical battle austria

sent cetinje russian government 1831 alongside nephew matija vučićević
two hailed turkish-controlled zeta plain lived russia much their lives
tasked establishing strong central government control country's many tribes
vukotić quite wealthy having inherited large sum money noble family member experience non-commissioned officer russian military
aside having deal russian political interference njegoš faced several other limitations power
no army militia police force enforce rule law within territory nominally controlled rely warriors own clan protection
tribes montenegrin frontier often either refused obey befriended enemies
tribal raids drove deep ottoman-held herzegovina occurred frequently looting proved key region's economic survival
though such raids normally elicited harsh response ottomans njegoš powerless stop them
creation governing senate introduced semblance order montenegrin politics
vukotić proclaimed senate's president vučićević became vice-president
montenegrins referred them their russian lordships
total senate made up twelve men received annual salary 40 talirs each
legislative judiciary executed powers first state institution montenegro's modern history
possibility any significant opposition senate's creation extinguished appointment important chieftains other prominent citizens senators

battle podgorica early attempts taxation reşid mehmed pasha impaled numerous montenegrins following attack podgorica example illustration pictured 1832 nineteen-year-old njegoš launched attack against muslim tribes podgorica helping ottomans subdue rebellions bosnia neighbouring albania
earlier times vladika guvernadur jointly led montenegrin warriors battle njegoš joined vukotić men
montenegrins also assisted rebellious hoti clan northern albania
njegoš forces still disadvantage lacked concrete strategy how deal ottomans expecting them bring cavalry onto field
montenegrins' guerilla-like approach warfare ill-suited taking city such podgorica whose high stone walls made impenetrable surrounding flatlands
launching attack njegoš also risked falling out russians time allied turks
badly outmaneuvered montenegrins defeated forced retreat taking them many wounded
njegoš defeat remain lasting source regret
grand vizier reşid mehmed pasha seized opportunity attacked string montenegrin towns villages response attack impaling hanging montenegrins captured
subsequent political pressure russia discouraged njegoš seeking revenge
response defeat podgorica montenegrins formed tactical alliances neighbouring muslims tribes hostile porte
entering such alliances njegoš risked further alienating russians whose support montenegro still desperately needed
neutralize any suspicion montenegro acting against russian interests njegoš cultivated close personal friendship vice-consul grujić advised czar njegoš dependable ever
letters grujić njegoš reported final advice petar gave before death pray god hold russia
1833 vukotić introduced regular taxation montenegro
vukotić grujić njegoš realized without taxes country no chance functioning centralized state let alone raise independent army survive without needing rely plunder russian charity

historian zdenko zlatar argues njegoš's mentor later secretary sima milutinović influenced any other person noting while milutinović great poet playwright [
no cetinje matter whole montenegro better knowledge wider world
indeed milutinović introduced njegoš own poetry professor svetlana slapšak describes being written unusual syntax unparalleled neologisms fantastic etymologies
position njegoš's secretary later occupied dimitrije milaković physically disabled dubrovnik-born polyglot studied philosophy vienna came montenegro vukotić vučićević 1832
milaković operated printing press cetinje monastery served editor-in-chief grlica edited njegoš's works prior their publication
njegoš also great admirer serbian revolutionary karađorđe led first serbian uprising dedicated gorski vijenac memory
linguist vuk karadžić influenced njegoš through reforms serbian language used own fame popularize njegoš's work
moreover introduced njegoš inner circle included leading serb poets day such branko radičević milica stojadinović-srpkinja
njegoš also impacted works foreign writers such dante alighieri's divine comedy john milton's paradise lost their influence strongly felt luča mikrokozma
slapšak notes njegoš born culture almost exclusively oral storytelling tradition written works religious nature recounted history montenegro
describing mastery traditional oral epic she asserts adequate literary genre age allowed interpret [his] community world himself language poetry
multiple scholars also noted similarities chorus ancient greek tragedies gorski vijenac kolo represents collective voice montenegro's inhabitants reflecting their hopes fears desires
epic also features similar character roles such pensive ruler danilo hero vuk mandušić blind prophetic monk iguman stefan lamenting woman batrić's sister
critical reception milovan djilas's njegoš poet prince bishop 1966 arguably most extensive work vladika any language
most written njegoš during lifetime work foreigners officials scholars travelers
earliest detailed academic analyses njegoš's works published milan rešetar 1890
following establishment common south slav state 1918 scholars reinterpreted njegoš yugoslav light despite writings being decidedly anti-muslim having potential alienate yugoslavia's muslim citizens formed ten percent new country's population

djilas himself great admirer njegoš later recounted gorski vijenac text carried side during second world war
njegoš's writings received varying degrees scholarly critical attention since death
studies written luča mikrokozma though very little written lažni car šćepan mali djilas believes contains njegoš's finest verse
njegoš's writings subject most scholarly analysis gorski vijenac virtually critics regard finest work

1913 gorski vijenac translated ten different languages
translated english twice once james w
wiles 1930 second time vasa
mihailovich 1986
set early 1700 s epic revolves around njegoš's ancestor vladika danilo ponders montenegrins converted islam amid increasing ottoman encroachment
danilo knows every montenegrin responsibility towards family towards clan kill fellow montenegrin elicit blood feud also realizes each man duty towards faith towards nation these two strains responsibility completely irreconcilable
ultimately montenegrin christians give their muslim kin option returning christianity facing death
christmas day those refuse comply killed their villages burned
light subject matter gorski vijenac became source considerable controversy during after yugoslav wars critics began re-examine text within context conflicts' many atrocities
judah goes far call paean ethnic cleansing
writes wake another balkan war significance missing link
helps explain how serbian national conscious molded how ideas national liberation became inextricably intertwined killing your neighbour burning village
scholars even claimed epic based historical massacre late 17 th century
djilas notes no such event mentioned authoritative history montenegro written danilo's successor vasilije published 1756
thus djilas concludes christmas day massacre either entirely fictional elimination montenegrin muslims occurred stages over long period time opposed single atrocity eradicating them
srdja pavlović contends massacre conflation two historical events widespread conversion montenegrins islam 1485 expulsion medojević family montenegro 1704 following property dispute
there no scholarly consensus whether christmas day massacre ever occurred

like many contemporaries gavrilo princip assassin archduke franz ferdinand austria knew gorski vijenac off heart
decades after njegoš' death gorski vijenac became montenegrin national epic reaffirming connections serbian christian worlds celebrating military skill warriors
serbs poem significant because evoked themes similar kosovo epics reminded them their solidarity montenegro against ottoman turks
after founding yugoslavia early 20 th century njegoš twice declared yugoslavia's national poet royal government 1920 s communist authorities following second world war
1947 100 th anniversary publication gorski vijenac government promoted njegoš montenegrin poet rather serb
change njegoš's ethnicity may related communist policy brotherhood unity promotion montenegrin ethnic identity communists proclaimed distinct serbs 1943
njegoš' works particularly gorski vijenac sources collective identity serbs montenegrins yugoslavs
njegoš's works removed school curricula bosnia herzegovina incite ethnic tensions given divisive nature works
influence parallels shakespeare english-speaking world language though archaic supplied modern serbian number well known quotations
