sima's biography described minor official town meng modern anhui state song living time king hui liang king xuan qi late 4 th century bc
sima qian writes chuang-tze made himself well acquainted literature time preferred views lao-tze ranked himself among followers ten myriads characters contained published writings greater part occupied metaphorical illustrations lao's doctrines
made old fisherman robber chih cutting open satchels satirize expose disciples confucius clearly exhibit sentiments lao
such names characters wei-lei hsu khang-sang tze fictitious pieces occur understood narratives real events
chuang admirable writer skillful composer instances truthful descriptions hit exposed mohists literati
ablest scholars day escape satire nor reply while allowed enjoyed himself sparkling dashing style thus greatest men even kings princes use their purposes
king wei chu having heard ability chuang chau sent messengers large gifts bring court promising also make chief minister
chuang-tze however laughed them thousand ounces silver great gain me high noble minister most honorable position
you seen victim-ox border sacrifice? carefully fed several years robed rich embroidery may fit enter grand temple
time comes prefer little pig get
go away quickly soil me your presence
rather amuse enjoy myself midst filthy ditch subject rules restrictions court sovereign
determined never take office prefer enjoyment my own free will
validity existence questioned including russell kirkland writes according modern understandings chinese tradition text known chuang-tzu production 'taoist' thinker ancient china named chuang chou/zhuang zhou
reality nothing sort
chuang-tzu known us today production thinker third century ce named kuo hsiang
though kuo long called merely 'commentator' reality much arranged texts compiled present 33-chapter edition
regarding identity original person named chuang chou/zhuangzi there no reliable historical data
however sima qian's biography zhuangzi pre-dates guo xiang kuo hsiang centuries
furthermore han shu yiwenzhi monograph literature lists text zhuangzi showing text title existed no later early st century ce again pre-dating guo xiang centuries
writing main article zhuangzi book zhuangzi traditionally credited author least part work bearing name zhuangzi
work current shape consisting 33 chapters traditionally divided three parts first known inner chapters consists first seven chapters second known outer chapters consist next 15 chapters last known mixed chapters consist remaining chapters
meaning these three names disputed according guo xiang inner chapters written zhuangzi outer chapters written disciples mixed chapters other hands other interpretation names refer origin titles chapters—the inner chapters take their titles phrases inside chapter outer chapters opening words chapters mixed chapters mixture these two sources
further study text does provide clear choice these alternatives
side martin palmer points out introduction translation two three chapters sima qian cited biography zhuangzi come outer chapters third mixed chapters
neither these allowed authentic chuang tzu chapters certain purists yet breathe very spirit chuang tzu just much example famous 'butterfly passage' chapter 2
other hand chapter 33 often considered intrusive being survey major movements during hundred schools thought emphasis philosophy hui shi
graham other critics subjected text stylistic analysis identified four strains thought book ideas zhuangzi disciples primitivist strain thinking similar laozi c strain very strongly represented chapters 8-11 attributed philosophy yang chu fourth strain may related philosophical school huang-lao

june 2013 general zhuangzi's philosophy skeptical arguing life limited knowledge gained unlimited
use limited pursue unlimited foolish
our language cognition general presuppose dao each us committed our separate past—our paths
consequently should aware our most carefully considered conclusions might seem misguided experienced different past
zhuangzi argues addition experience our natural dispositions combined acquired ones—including dispositions use names things approve/disapprove based those names act accordance embodied standards
thinking choosing our next step down our dao path conditioned unique set natural acquisitions
zhuangzi's thought also considered precursor relativism systems value
relativism even leads doubt basis pragmatic arguments good course action preserves our lives since presupposes life good death bad
fourth section great happiness 至樂 zhìlè chapter 18 zhuangzi expresses pity skull sees lying side road
zhuangzi laments skull now dead skull retorts how you know it's bad dead? another example two famous courtesans points out there no universally objective standard beauty

encounter also outlines part daoist practice observing learning natural world
anarchism zhuangzi world does need governing fact should governed good order results spontaneously things let alone
ecology chapter 2 zhuangzi outlines concepts describing interdependence things way foreshadows modern ecological thinking
typical daoism emphasis interdependence opposing concepts zhaungzi's distinctive style point pushed absurdity there no thing there no thing
doesn't see itself
self-knowledge precedes knowing others
it's arises out also caused exactly
theory born together
although true enough there's birth there's death there's death birth
there's possible there impossible impossible possible
cause right you cause wrong cause wrong cause right
