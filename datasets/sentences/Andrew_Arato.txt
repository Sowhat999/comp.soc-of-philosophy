second phase arato worked through corpus western marxian thinkers construct critical theory state socialist societies
phase three marked turn post-marxist emphasis civil society moral analytical category meant further project democratization both east west
finally latest work arato engages comparative studies recent constitution making developed theory “post-sovereign” constitution making
praxis theory first phase arato’s academic work emphasized recovery early humanistic marxism
such hegelian marxism highlighted active constitution social order through “praxis” collective action interacting groups
arato’s philosophical investigations here paralleled thought critical intellectuals east especially “budapest school” “renaissance marxism” during 1960 s early 1970 s
perspective also manifested philosophical outlook american journal radical theory telos
arato served telos’s editorial board 1971 1984
arato’s emphasis social praxis concomitant categories subjectivity culture alienation displayed dissertation early 20 th-century marxian philosophy györgy lukács

arato notes 1979 book young lukacs origins western marxism elaboration critical western marxism emphasis intentional collective action praxis also intended critique authoritarian communist governments eastern europe
arato's praxis theory western marxism general privileged active democratic participation groups individuals their supposedly collective self-determination criticized orthodox communist parties their claims know true interests working class able make proper decisions them form “substitutionalism
contrast control communist state enforced passivity working classes “true socialism” western marxists should democracy democracy extended political sphere economy indeed social institutions
implicit critique state socialist societies however largely operated level abstract social philosophy
hungarian critics gyorgy bence janos kis noted rebirth marxian philosophy east “sidestepped problem basic class antagonism” intrinsic socialist dictatorships eastern europe
understanding authoritarian state socialism second stage intellectual itinerary arato made exact turn social philosophy critical analysis east european social formations during late 1970 s–1980 s
operating procedure somewhat scholastic
after another arato examined best neo-marxist analyses state socialism written such authors herbert marcuse cornelius castoriadis rudolf bahro habermas iván szelényi
critically assessed adequacy their efforts analyze social dynamics stratification crisis potentiality legitimating ideology state socialist societies
arato sought model himself marx analyzing criticizing exploitative hierarchical dimensions social formation
recognized however theoretical tools offered marx himself historical materialism often used state socialist societies veil their politically based class inequalities expose them
further arato argued marxian writers typically trapped problematic marx’s philosophy history conceive two possible modern industrialized social formations either capitalism progressive socialist society
instead arato along number east european theorists sought analyze state socialist societies new hierarchical exploitative social formation “sui generis” understood communist societies unique social formation own particular mechanisms control exploitation crisis
arato argued type society understood focusing market economic relations instead rested type prerogative political control operating through bureaucratic state
arato’s essays collected 1993 volume neo-marxism democratic theory essays critical theory soviet-type societies
despite richness efforts arato saw little connection exercises social system analysis active social movements aiming transform state socialism
indeed noted type structural analysis blocked perception new rising social movements eastern europe most especially poland’s solidarność emerged 1980
late 1980 s arato “disengaged” project developing critical theory authoritarian socialism theory seemed better capture new essential rising social movements oppositions eastern europe while also offering powerful tool criticize inadequacies western capitalist democracies theory civil society
transition arato left work gnawing criticism mice repeat marx’s quip paralleled similar shifts among east european critical intellectuals
same time turn reflect intrinsic limits original project
arato noted abstract ideal typical models social system dynamics often failed incorporate considerations national histories cultural traditions along inherited social institutions
precisely those contested national cultural traditions form symbolic resources movements opposing authoritarian socialist state also contrast legitimating rule communist state
furthermore such analyses systems reproduction dissecting dynamics instrumental logics state markets typically ignores normative institutionalized categories lifeworld civil society might support autonomous social domain solidarity open public communication also terrain social movements
civil society precisely these ideal categories social autonomy civil society arato shifted third stage
such change intellectual direction clearly sparked rising opposition movement solidarność exciting developments poland 1980–81 resulting arato’s early articulation category civil society oft-cited 1981 essay “civil society vs
state poland 1980-1981
civil society arato writers poland hungary also france south america meant social space outside state corporate control groups individuals engage something approximating free association communication among equals
social space ideally entailed whole sets laws rights institutions help secure individual autonomy public freedom
civil society’s fully developed modern form arato such realm protected legal rights possesses channels influence separate institutions economy state developed organizational life media organizations enhance social communication strengthen social relations
nowhere these requirements fully met ideal civil society thus offered basis social movements seeking enrich extend ideals everywhere
arato new focus civil society constituted part rejection traditional marxian problematic post-marxist
intellectuals eastern europe criticized marx’s advocacy radical democratic reunification state society supposedly collective free social order
rejected marx’s idea ending distinction state society state market along conception unalienated collective subject totally undivided control itself
experience eastern europe russia suggested utopian merging government society inevitably resulted authoritarian forms rule
resulted either loss independent freedom civil society under embracing control party-state else saw regression economic rationality community state subjected economy their traditional norms political calculations
instead partly normative reasons partly strategic reasons prevent repression state ussr invasion opposition movements eastern europe throughout world sought take over government strengthen forms freedom modern civil society forms solidarity free communicative interaction active democratic participation autonomous publics plurality associations
goal—arato argued eastern europe soon extended model west—should protection indeed strengthening civil society democratization institution building separate strategic instrumental logics power hierarchies state capitalist economy
collaboration jean cohen arato concluded “the idea reconstruction democratization civil society become foundation critical theory modern societies including west
late 1970 s 1980 s beyond problematic civil society spread across europe latin american asia powerful theory ideal guide social movements obtainable advances freedom
“for better worse” arato noted “jean cohen myself led discussion [of civil society] united states
here too arato drew heavily work habermas especially habermas’s book rise decline public sphere
arato noted habermas’s writings “uniquely important role rediscovery critique reconstruction early modern concept civil society
addition habermas’s later social theory articulated ideal model modern society’s “differentiated” structure need defend separate institutions communicative social interaction cultural traditions proper lifeworld
furthermore habermas’s theory suggested tripartite model society civil society institutional structure society’s cultural lifeworld opposed strategic instrumental rationality embodied economy state
three-part model ideal social organization — state economy civil society — arato make idea civil society strengthening critical tool western capitalist societies
initial 1981 1982 articles poland civil society full decade passed before jean cohen issued their magnum opus civil society political theory
despite late publication intimidating size 794 pages volume quickly became much-cited classic
october 2010 google scholar listed over 2600 publications citing book
during time arato remained associated radical journal telos
however relevance vitality category civil society west became object vigorous dispute telos most especially paul piccone journal’s pugnacious editor
piccone elaborated own perspective under rubric “artificial negativity” theory failed see any autonomous cultural dynamics current u
civil society outside state’s manipulation control supposedly atomized narcissistic population consumers
ensuing debates arato cohen ended their long association journal
post-sovereign constitution making 1989 epochal year world history liberation east european countries soviet dominance transformation ussr negotiated transformations governments constitutions eastern europe 1989–90
unique nature transitions powerful intellectual political issues writing new constitution soon became arato's prime target intellectual investigation
closely followed political debate surrounding drafting constitutions hungary maintained continued such critical intellectuals janos kis co-founder first chair alliance free democrats hungary’s liberal party until
1996–97 arato served consultant hungarian parliament constitutional issues
ensuing years published commentary analysis constitutional issues nepal turkey south africa iraq after u
invasion nation 2003
analysis creation new constitution iraq resulted 2009 book constitution making under occupation politics imposed revolution iraq
arato elaborated theory “post-sovereign” constitution making considered key political innovation occasioned construction negotiated transitions dictatorship new democratic constitutions eastern europe also south africa spain other countries
believed particular form constitution making pronounced advantages politically normatively over traditional model
declared “1989 produce something dramatically new political paradigm radical transformation
yielding historically new superior model constitutional creation beyond revolutionary democratic european models
according arato post-sovereign model typically entailed two-stage process transition dictatorship constitutional democracy
first initial roundtable negotiations power holders significant social voices
negotiation established ground rules subsequent stage elected assembly new constitution
constitutional court gave significant overview process ensuring constitutional assembly abided ground rules roundtable
ideally arato argued process should characterized broad social inclusion equality transparency publicity
post sovereignty arato meant creation constitution abandoned mythology being issued people themselves ultimate sovereign authority speaking directly unmediated form
such mythology arato often authoritarian consequences resulting leader party claiming represent people without needing any special limits rights ensure populace actually voice political decision making
such process besides remedying past deficiencies also address conundrum political legitimacy outlined thinkers such jacques derrida giorgio agamben noted democracies contained undemocratic illegitimate arbitrary even violent moment their founding
