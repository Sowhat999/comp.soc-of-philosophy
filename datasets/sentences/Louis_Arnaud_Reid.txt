contents theory perception 2 embodied meaning 3 epistemology 4 phenomenology 5 education 6 bibliography 7 references theory perception first book knowledge truth reid argued against representational theory perception
view implicit locke see object fact see image representation our mind product stimulation our optic nerves light
problem account makes image immediate object perception thus leaves us no direct evidence physical world
leaves us vulnerable berkeley's idealism view there no physical world
reid anticipating mary warnock argued representational theory faulty
see argued ‘seeing’ image sense datum mind ‘seeing’ world albeit direct fashion imagined naïve realist
‘seeing’ fact act image datum constructed first place
imaging thus compared act blind person constructs ‘image’ external world basis information transmitted through her white cane though our visual sense much sophisticated appears immediate fact mediated light physical intermediary like cane involves same kind construction
‘imaging’ thus object-directed mental act
basis reid’s qualified realism
follows sense datum known active way knowing world
moreover sense datum per se abstraction rather substantial entity though sensing conceived act very real
sense qualities qualia radical sense secondary qualities representations world instead presentations way understand world
embodied meaning follows there no problem understanding how qualitative aspects art embody meaning given qualia paradigmatically mental interpretative
solves central puzzles how art works
basis reid's argument art embodies meaning
epistemology reid goes further makes epistemological claim arts way knowing
rejects common view knowledge paradigmatically propositional regarding propositional meaning something mind abstracts concrete experience
our propositions first our sensory concrete understandings world though turn construction influenced our conceptual understanding
phenomenology reid's phenomenology also centred role feeling thinking think 'thinking' kind computational manipulation propositions
instead propositions codify our underlying feelings relations things world
feeling thinking two sides same coin
'feeling' reid thus referring kind merely subjective quality
regarded sensation paradigmatic kind feeling kind feeling cognitive world directed
influenced susanne langer's views feeling anticipated antonio damasio's somatic marker hypothesis well views nicholas humphrey george lakoff mark johnson others
views largely developed independently continental phenomenologists whose works well known britain early inter-war period
may unknowingly influenced coleridge whose philosophy supervisor j
