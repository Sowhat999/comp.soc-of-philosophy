freedom community 1936 consequence invitation give lectures ministry heavy industry ussr polanyi met bukharin socialist societies scientific research directed accord needs latest five year plan
polanyi noted happened study genetics soviet union once doctrines trofim lysenko gained backing state
demands britain example marxist john desmond bernal centrally planned scientific research led polanyi defend claim science requires free debate
together john baker founded influential society freedom science
series articles re-published contempt freedom 1940 logic liberty 1951 polanyi claimed co-operation amongst scientists analogous way agents co-ordinate themselves within free market
just consumers free market determine value products science spontaneous order arises consequence open debate amongst specialists
science contrary claims bukharin flourishes scientists liberty pursue truth end itself [s]cientists freely making their own choice problems pursuing them light their own personal judgment fact co-operating members closely knit organization
such self-co-ordination independent initiatives leads joint result unpremeditated any those bring
any attempt organize group
under single authority eliminate their independent initiatives thus reduce their joint effectiveness single person directing them centre
effect paralyse their co-operation
derived phrase spontaneous order gestalt psychology adopted classical liberal economist frederick hayek although concept traced back least adam smith
polanyi unlike hayek argued there higher lower forms spontaneous order asserted defending scientific inquiry utilitarian sceptical grounds undermined practice science
extends general claim free societies
polanyi defends free society negative grounds ought respect private liberties positive grounds public liberties facilitate our pursuit objective ideals
according polanyi free society strives value-neutral undermines own justification
enough members free society believe ideals such truth justice beauty objective also accept transcend our ability wholly capture them
objectivity values must combined acceptance knowing fallible

central bank should attempt moderate economic booms/busts via strict/loose monetary policy
knowing personal book science faith society 1946 polanyi set out opposition positivist account science noting ignores role personal commitments play practice science
polanyi invited give prestigious gifford lectures 1951-2 aberdeen
revised version lectures later published personal knowledge 1958
book polanyi claims knowledge claims including those derive rules rely personal judgements
denies scientific method yield truth mechanically
knowing no matter how formalised relies upon commitments
polanyi argued assumptions underlie critical philosophy false undermine commitments motivate our highest achievements
advocates fiduciary post-critical approach recognise believe prove know say
knower does stand apart universe participates personally within
our intellectual skills driven passionate commitments motivate discovery validation
according polanyi great scientist identifies patterns also chooses significant questions likely lead successful resolution
innovators risk their reputation committing hypothesis
polanyi cites example copernicus declared earth revolves around sun
claims copernicus arrived earth's true relation sun consequence following method via greater intellectual satisfaction derived celestial panorama seen sun instead earth
writings practice science influenced thomas kuhn paul feyerabend
polanyi rejected claim british empiricists experience reduced sense data also rejects notion indwelling within sometimes incompatible interpretative frameworks traps us within them
our tacit awareness connects us albeit fallibly reality
supplies us context within our articulations meaning
contrary views colleague friend alan turing whose work victoria university manchester prepared way first modern computer denied minds reducible collections rules
work influenced critique hubert dreyfus first generation artificial intelligence
while writing personal knowledge identified structure tacit knowing
viewed most important discovery
claimed experience world integrating our subsidiary awareness focal awareness
later work example terry lectures later published tacit dimension 1966 distinguishes phenomenological instrumental semantic ontological aspects tacit knowing discussed necessarily identified such previous writing
critique reductionism life's irreducible structure 1968 polanyi argues information contained dna molecule reducible laws physics chemistry
although dna molecule cannot exist without physical properties these properties constrained higher-level ordering principles
transcendence self-transcendence 1970 polanyi criticises mechanistic world view modern science inherited galileo
polanyi advocates emergence
claim there several levels reality causality
relies assumption boundary conditions supply degrees freedom instead being random determined higher-level realities whose properties dependent distinct lower level emerge
example higher-level reality functioning downward causal force consciousness intentionality generating meanings intensionality
mind higher-level expression capacity living organisms discrimination
our pursuit self-set ideals such truth justice transforms our understanding world
reductionistic attempt reduce higher-level realities lower-level realities generates polanyi calls moral inversion higher rejected moral passion
polanyi identifies pathology modern mind traces origins false conception knowledge although relatively harmless formal sciences pathology generates nihilism humanities
polanyi considered marxism example moral inversion
state grounds appeal logic history uses coercive powers ways disregard any appeals morality
