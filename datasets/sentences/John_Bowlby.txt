james robertson 1952 making documentary film two-year old goes hospital films young children brief separation
[citation needed] documentary illustrated impact loss suffering experienced young children separated their primary caretakers
film instrumental campaign alter hospital restrictions visiting parents
1952 robertson presented their film two year old goes hospital british psychoanalytical society psychoanalysts accept child mourn experience grief separation instead saw child's distress caused elements unconscious fantasies film because mother pregnant
melanie klein during psychoanalytic training
she supervisor however different views role mother treatment three-year-old boy
specifically importantly klein stressed role child's fantasies mother bowlby emphasised actual history relationship
bowlby's views—that children responding real life events unconscious fantasies—were rejected psychoanalysts bowlby effectively ostracised psychoanalytic community
later expressed view interest real-life experiences situations alien kleinian outlook
furthermore bowlby explained interview milton stenn 1977 psychoanalytic community accept developmental theories completely different unconscious fantasy theories surrounding psychoanalysis during time
further explained there certain groups took great enthusiasm other groups directly lukewarm other hostile each profession reacted differently
social workers took enthusiasm psychoanalysts treated caution curiously me infuriatingly pediatricians initially hostile subsequently many them became very supporting adult psychiatrists totally uninterested totally ignorant totally uninterested
donald winnicott pediatrician child psychoanalyst immense influence bowlby’s work career
bowlby winnicott several similarities within their professional work first explain importance social interactions early age
both bowlby winnicott argued humans come world predisposition sensitive social interactions need these interactions order healthy development
however although bowlby winnicott’s ideas similar took vastly different approaches dealing their research
example bowlby interested how child’s environment internalized affects child’s development while winnicott interested “the way inner world engages thereby affected external events”
despite their differences approaching their research interests bowlby explained interview research world health organization influenced policies regarding child care however none possible without help winnicott
winnicott worked clinical level bowlby influenced several social workers spent career working change policies

maternal deprivation main article maternal deprivation 1949 bowlby's earlier work delinquent affectionless children effects hospitalised institutionalised care led being commissioned write world health organization's report mental health homeless children post-war europe
result maternal care mental health published 1951
bowlby drew together such limited empirical evidence existed time across europe usa
main conclusions “the infant young child should experience warm intimate continuous relationship mother permanent mother substitute both find satisfaction enjoyment” may significant irreversible mental health consequences both controversial influential
1951 publication highly influential causing widespread changes practices prevalence institutional care infants children changing practices relating visiting infants small children hospitals parents
theoretical basis controversial many ways
broke psychoanalytic theories saw infants' internal life being determined fantasy rather real life events
critics profoundly disagreed necessity maternal equivalent love function normally formation ongoing relationship child important part parenting
others questioned extent hypothesis supported evidence
there criticism confusion effects privation no primary attachment figure deprivation loss primary attachment figure particular failure distinguish effects lack primary attachment figure other forms deprivation understimulation may affect children institutions
monograph also used political purposes claim any separation mother deleterious discourage women working leaving their children daycare governments concerned maximising employment returned returning servicemen
1962 published deprivation maternal care reassessment effects mary ainsworth bowlby's close colleague contributed approval present recent research developments address misapprehensions
publication also attempted address previous lack evidence effects paternal deprivation
according rutter importance bowlby's initial writings 'maternal deprivation' lay emphasis children's experiences interpersonal relationships crucial their psychological development
development attachment theory 1988 work secure base bowlby explained data time publication maternal care mental health accommodated any theory then current brief time my employment world health organization there no possibility developing new
then went describe subsequent development attachment theory
because dissatisfied traditional theories bowlby sought new understanding such fields evolutionary biology ethology developmental psychology cognitive science control systems theory drew upon them formulate innovative proposition mechanisms underlying infants tie emerged result evolutionary pressure
bowlby realised develop new theory motivation behaviour control built up-to-date science rather outdated psychic energy model espoused freud
bowlby expressed himself having made good deficiencies data lack theory link alleged cause effect maternal care mental health later work attachment loss published 1969
ethology evolutionary concepts 1950 s bowlby personal scientific contact leading european scientists field ethology namely niko tinbergen konrad lorenz especially rising star ethology robert hinde
bowlby inspired study lorenz conducted goslings showing imprint first animate object see
bowlby encouraged evolutionary biologist julian huxley look further ethology help further research psychoanalysis introduced bowlby impactful work tinbergen “the study instinct”
bowlby followed guidance became interested ethology wanted rewrite psychoanalysis order focus research field around concrete theory psychoanalysis lacking
admired methodological approach ethology psychoanalysis familiar van horst 2011
reading everything ethology bowlby possibly get hands able learn ethology researchers supported theoretical ideas through concrete empirical data
using viewpoints emerging science reading extensively ethology literature bowlby developed new explanatory hypotheses now known human attachment behaviour
particular basis ethological evidence able reject dominant cupboard love theory attachment prevailing psychoanalysis learning theory 1940 s 1950 s
also introduced concepts environmentally stable labile human behaviour allowing revolutionary combination idea species-specific genetic bias become attached concept individual differences attachment security environmentally labile strategies adaptation specific childrearing niche
alternatively bowlby's thinking nature function caregiver-child relationship influenced ethological research inspired students animal behaviour such tinbergen hinde harry harlow
interestingly harlow’s students explained importance bowlby’s contributions ethology explained several ways bowlby made impact field
suomi explained bowlby brought attachment research animal research specifically rhesus monkeys various other species monkeys apes
another contribution according suomi bowlby influenced animal researchers examine separation animals
furthermore explained bowlby brought field ethology acknowledgement consequences over time different attachment styles prevalent rhesus monkeys specifically work harlow
suomi further explained “although bowlby psychoanalyst formal training true ethologist heart”
bowlby spurred hinde start ground breaking work attachment separation primates monkeys humans general emphasized importance evolutionary thinking human development foreshadowed new interdisciplinary approach evolutionary psychology
obviously encounter ethology attachment theory led genuine cross-fertilization— van horst van veer & van ijzendoorn 2007 p
attachment loss trilogy main articles attachment theory attachment children before publication trilogy 1969 1972 1980 main tenets attachment theory building concepts ethology developmental psychology presented british psychoanalytical society london three now classic papers nature child’s tie mother 1958 separation anxiety 1959 grief mourning infancy early childhood 1960
bowlby rejected psychoanalytic explanations attachment return psychoanalysts rejected theory
same time bowlby's former colleague mary ainsworth completing extensive observational studies nature infant attachments uganda bowlby's ethological theories mind
her results other studies contributed greatly subsequent evidence base attachment theory presented 1969 attachment first volume attachment loss trilogy
second third volumes separation anxiety anger loss sadness depression followed 1972 1980 respectively
attachment revised 1982 incorporate recent research
according attachment theory attachment infants primarily process proximity seeking identified attachment figure situations perceived distress alarm purpose survival
infants become attached adults sensitive responsive social interactions infant remain consistent caregivers months during period 6 months two years age
parental responses lead development patterns attachment turn lead 'internal working models' will guide individual's feelings thoughts expectations later relationships
specifically bowlby explained three volume series attachment 1973 1980 & 1982 humans develop internal working model self internal working model others
self-model other-model built off early experiences their primary caregiver shape individual’s expectation future interactions others interactions within interpersonal relationships
self-model will determine how individual sees themselves will impact their self-confidence self-esteem dependency
other-model will determine how individual sees others will impact their avoidance approach orientation loneliness isolation social interactions
bowlby's approach human infant considered need secure relationship adult caregivers without normal social emotional development will occur
toddler grows uses attachment figure figures 'secure base' explore
mary ainsworth used feature plus 'stranger wariness' reunion behaviours other features attachment behaviour develop research tool called 'strange situation' developing classifying different attachment styles
attachment process gender specific infants will form attachments any consistent caregiver sensitive responsive social interactions infant
quality social engagement appears influential amount time spent
darwin biography bowlby's last work published posthumously biography charles darwin discusses darwin's mysterious illness whether psychosomatic
work bowlby explained order obtain clear understanding current relationships existing members any family usually illuminating examine how pattern family relationships evolved
leads study earlier generations calamities other events may affected their lives patterns family interaction results
case family darwin grew up believe such study amply rewarding
reason alone necessary start grandfathers’ generation
quote important demonstrates bowlby’s entire career focusing child’s early environmental experiences
bowlby still believed most important aspect understanding mental illnesses final published work even understanding well-known respected charles darwin
bowlby's legacy main article attachment theory although without critics attachment theory described dominant approach understanding early social development given rise great surge empirical research formation children's close relationships
presently formulated used research purposes bowlby's attachment theory stresses following important tenets children 6 30 months very likely form emotional attachments familiar caregivers especially adults sensitive responsive child communications
emotional attachments young children shown behaviourally their preferences particular familiar people their tendency seek proximity those people especially times distress their ability use familiar adults secure base explore environment
formation emotional attachments contributes foundation later emotional personality development type behaviour toward familiar adults shown toddlers continuity social behaviours will show later life
events interfere attachment such abrupt separation toddler familiar people significant inability carers sensitive responsive consistent their interactions short-term possible long-term negative impacts child's emotional cognitive life
