contents psychological egoism 2 bibliography 3 see also 4 notes 5 references 6 external links psychological egoism paper prepared 1958 benefit students brown feinberg seeks refute philosophical theory psychological egoism opinion fallacious
far tell there four primary arguments every action mine prompted motives desires impulses my motives somebody else's
[w]hen person gets wants characteristically feels pleasure
often deceive ourselves thinking desire something fine noble really want thought well others able congratulate ourselves able enjoy pleasures good conscience [
indeed simple matter explain away allegedly unselfish motives [
quotes lucius f
garvin effect once conviction selfishness universal finds root person's mind very likely burgeon out thousand corroborating generalizations
will discovered friendly smile really attempt win approving nod less gullible recording angel charitable deed performer opportunity congratulate himself good fortune cleverness enables charitable public benefaction just plain good business advertising
will emerge gods worshipped because indulge men's selfish fears tastes hopes golden rule no eminently sound success formula social political codes created subscribed because serve restrain other men's egoism much one's own morality being special sort racket intrigue using weapons persuasion place bombs machine guns
under interpretation human nature categories commercialism replace those disinterested service spirit horse trader broods over face earth
psychological egoists often notice moral education inculcation manners usually utilise bentham calls 'sanctions pleasure pain
children made acquire civilising virtues method enticing rewards painful punishments
much same true history race
people general inclined behave well made plain them there 'something them
then highly probable just such mechanism human motivation bentham describes must presupposed our methods moral education? feinberg observes such arguments psychological egoism rarely mounted basis empirical proof being psychological very well ought
opening argument dubs tautology nothing whatever concerning nature my motives objective my desires possibly follow [
genesis action origin motives makes 'selfish' rather 'purpose' act objective motives motive comes voluntary actions comes agent aims determines whether selfish
similarly flawed feinberg's opinion second argument
just because successful endeavour engenders pleasure does necessarily entail pleasure sole objective endeavour
uses william james's analogy illustrate fallacy although ocean liner consumes coal trans-atlantic voyages unlikely sole purpose these voyages coal consumption
third argument unlike first two contains no non sequitur feinberg see
nevertheless adjudges such sweeping generalisation unlikely true
final argument feinberg sees paradox
way achieve happiness believes forget psychological egoists hold human endeavour even achieves happiness geared towards happiness
feinberg poses thought experiment character named jones apathetic pursuit own happiness
because no means achieve end however [i]t takes little imagination [
see jones's desire bound frustrated
pursue happiness then fail utterly achieve
