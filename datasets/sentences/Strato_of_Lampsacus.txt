strato devoted himself especially study natural science whence obtained appears cicero assumed name physicus greek φυσικός

philosophy aristotle theophrastus strato
part fresco national university athens
strato emphasized need exact research example made use observation how water pouring spout breaks separate droplets evidence falling bodies accelerate
whereas aristotle defined time numbered aspect motion strato argued because motion time continuous whereas number discrete time existence independent motion
critical aristotle's concept place surrounding surface preferring see space thing occupies
also rejected existence aristotle's fifth element
emphasized role pneuma 'breath' 'spirit' functioning soul soul-activities explained pneuma extending throughout body 'ruling part' located head
sensation felt ruling-part soul rather extremities body sensation involves thought there no thought derived sensation
denied soul immortal attacked 'proofs' put forward plato phaedo
strato believed matter consisted tiny particles rejected democritus' theory empty space
strato's view void does exist empty spaces imperfectly fitting particles space filled kind matter
such theory permitted phenomena such compression allowed penetration light heat through apparently solid bodies
seems denied existence any god outside material universe held every particle matter plastic seminal power without sensation intelligence life sensation intellect forms accidents affections matter
cicero took exception nor does pupil strato called natural philosopher deserve listened holds divine force resident nature contains says principles birth increase decay lacks remind sensation form
like atomists leucippus democritus before strato lampsacus materialist believed everything universe composed matter energy
strato first philosophers formulate secular worldview god merely unconscious force nature
you deny without god there anything here you yourself seem go contrary strato lampsacus concedes god pardon great task
priests god vacation much just gods also vacation fact denies need appreciate work gods order construct world
things exist teaches produced nature hence says according philosophy claims these things made rough smooth corpuscles indented hooked void interfering these upholds dreams democritus taught dreamt
strato fact investigating individual parts world teaches produced produced weight motion
thus liberates god big job me fear
strato endeavoured replace aristotelian teleology purely physical explanation phenomena underlying elements found heat cold especially heat active principle
although strato's view universe seen secular may accepted existence gods within universe context ancient greek religion unlikely regarded himself atheist
geology quoted charles lyell's principles geology strabo passes hypothesis strato natural philosopher observed quantity mud brought down rivers euxine great bed must gradually raised while rivers still continued pour undiminished quantity water
therefore conceived originally euxine inland sea level means become much elevated burst barrier near byzantium formed communication propontis partial drainage already supposed converted left side marshy ground last whole choked up soil
argued mediterranean once opened passage itself columns hercules atlantic perhaps abundance sea-shells africa near temple jupiter ammon might also deposit former inland sea length forced passage escaped
modern era strato's name meant little middle ages renaissance however 17 th century name suddenly became famous because supposed similarities system pantheistic views spinoza
ralph cudworth choosing attack atheism 1678 chose strato's system four types atheism doing coined term hylozoism describe any system primitive matter endowed life-force
these ideas reached pierre bayle adopted strato 'stratonism' key components own philosophy
continuation des pensees diverses published 1705 stratonism become most important ancient equivalent spinozism
bayle strato made everything follow fixed order necessity no innate good bad universe universe living thing intelligence intent there no other divine power nature
