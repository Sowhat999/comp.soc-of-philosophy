philosophy philosophy despair lev shestov shestov's philosophy first sight philosophy offers no systematic unity no coherent set propositions no theoretical explanation philosophical problems
most shestov's work fragmentary
regard form often used aphorisms style may deemed web-like linear explosive argumentative
author seems contradict himself every page even seeks out paradoxes
because believes life itself last analysis deeply paradoxical comprehensible through logical rational inquiry
shestov maintains no theory solve mysteries life
fundamentally philosophy 'problem-solving' problem-generating pronounced emphasis life's enigmatic qualities
point departure theory idea experience experience despair shestov describes loss certainties loss freedom loss meaning life
root despair frequently calls 'necessity' also 'reason' 'idealism' 'fate' certain way thinking same time also very real aspect world subordinates life ideas abstractions generalisations thereby kills through ignoring uniqueness livingness reality
'reason' obedience acceptance certainties tell us certain things eternal unchangeable other things impossible never attained
accounts shestov's philosophy being form irrationalism though important note thinker does oppose reason science general rationalism scientism tendency consider reason sort omniscient omnipotent god good own sake
may also considered form personalism people cannot reduced ideas social structures mystical oneness
shestov rejects any mention omnitudes collective all-unity
explains masterpiece athens jerusalem why attribute god god whom neither time nor space limits same respect love order? why forever speak total unity? god loves men need subordinate men divine will deprive them their own will most precious things bestowed upon them? there no need
consequently idea total unity absolutely false idea
forbidden reason speak unity even unities must renounce total unity - other things besides
sigh relief men will breathe suddenly discover living god true god no way resembles whom reason shown them until now! through attack self-evident shestov implies seemingly alone our suffering helped neither others nor philosophy
explains lack systematic philosophical framework
penultimate words surrender versus struggle despair last word 'penultimate word'
last word cannot human language can't captured theory
philosophy begins despair whole thinking desperate shestov tries point something beyond despair - beyond philosophy
calls 'faith' belief certainty another way thinking arises midst deepest doubt insecurity
experience everything possible dostoevsky opposite necessity chance accident possibility there does exist god-given freedom without boundaries without walls borders
shestov maintains should continue struggle fight against fate necessity even successful outcome guaranteed
exactly moment oracles remain silent should give ourselves over god alone comfort sick suffering soul
most famous words explains faith faith looks creator inspires radiates itself supreme decisive truths condemning
reality transfigured
heavens glorify lord
prophets apostles cry ecstasy o death thy sting? hell thy victory? announce eye hath seen nor ear heard neither entered heart man things god hath prepared them love
quoting corinthians 1555 29 furthermore although jewish philosopher shestov saw resurrection christ victory over necessity
described incarnation resurrection jesus transfiguring spectacle demonstrated purpose life mystical surrender absolute ascetical struggle cur deus homo? why purpose become man expose himself injurious mistreatment ignominious painful death cross? order show man through example no decision too hard worth while bearing anything order remain womb one? any torture whatever living being better 'bliss' rest-satiate 'ideal' being? likewise final words last greatest work athens jerusalem philosophy besinnen [think over] struggle
struggle no end will no end
kingdom god written attained through violence
