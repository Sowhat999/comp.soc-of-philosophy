founding contributor rudolf clausius william thomson lord kelvin science thermodynamics particularly focusing first three thermodynamic laws
rankine developed complete theory steam engine indeed heat engines
manuals engineering science practice used many decades after their publication 1850 s 1860 s
published several hundred papers notes science engineering topics 1840 onwards interests extremely varied including youth botany music theory number theory mature years most major branches science mathematics engineering

rankine initially educated home later attended ayr academy 1828-9 very briefly high school glasgow 1830
around 1830 family moved edinburgh 1834 studied military naval academy mathematician george lees year already highly proficient mathematics received gift uncle newton's principia 1687 original latin
1836 rankine began study spectrum scientific topics university edinburgh including natural history under robert jameson natural philosophy under james david forbes
under forbes awarded prizes essays methods physical inquiry undulatory wave theory light
during vacations assisted father 1830 manager later effective treasurer engineer edinburgh dalkeith railway brought coal growing city
left university edinburgh 1838 without degree then unusual perhaps because straitened family finances became apprentice sir john benjamin macneill time surveyor irish railway commission
during pupilage developed technique later known rankine's method laying out railway curves fully exploiting theodolite making substantial improvement accuracy productivity over existing methods
fact technique simultaneously use other engineers 1860 s there minor dispute rankine's priority
year 1842 also marked rankine's first attempt reduce phenomena heat mathematical form frustrated lack experimental data
time queen victoria's visit scotland organised large bonfire situated arthur's seat constructed radiating air passages under fuel
bonfire served beacon initiate chain other bonfires across scotland
thermodynamics undaunted returned youthful fascination mechanics heat engine
though theory circulating streams elastic vortices whose volumes spontaneously adapted their environment sounds fanciful scientists formed modern account 1849 succeeded finding relationship saturated vapour pressure temperature
following year used theory establish relationships temperature pressure density gases expressions latent heat evaporation liquid
accurately predicted surprising fact apparent specific heat saturated steam negative
emboldened success 1851 set out calculate efficiency heat engines used theory basis deduce principle maximum efficiency possible any heat engine function two temperatures operates
though similar result already derived rudolf clausius william thomson rankine claimed result rested upon hypothesis molecular vortices alone rather upon carnot's theory other additional assumption
work marked first step rankine's journey develop complete theory heat
rankine later recast results molecular theories terms macroscopic account energy transformations
defined distinguished actual energy lost dynamic processes potential energy replaced
assumed sum two energies constant idea already although surely very long familiar law conservation energy
1854 made wide use thermodynamic function later realised identical entropy clausius
1855 rankine formulated science energetics gave account dynamics terms energy transformations rather force motion
theory very influential 1890 s
1859 proposed rankine scale temperature absolute thermodynamic scale whose degree equal fahrenheit degree
energetics offered rankine alternative rather mainstream approach science mid-1850 s made rather less use molecular vortices
yet still claimed maxwell's work electromagnetics effectively extension model
1864 contended microscopic theories heat proposed clausius james clerk maxwell based linear atomic motion inadequate
1869 rankine admitted success these rival theories
time own model atom become almost identical thomson
constant aim especially teacher engineering used own theories develop number practical results elucidate their physical principles including rankine–hugoniot equation propagation shock waves governs behaviour shock waves normal oncoming flow
named after physicists rankine french engineer pierre henri hugoniot rankine cycle analysis ideal heat-engine condensor
like other thermodynamic cycles maximum efficiency rankine cycle given calculating maximum efficiency carnot cycle properties steam gases vapours
history rotordynamics replete interplay theory practice
rankine first performed analysis spinning shaft 1869 model adequate predicted supercritical speeds attained
fatigue studies drawing fatigue failure axle 1843
rankine first engineers recognise fatigue failures railway axles caused initiation growth brittle cracks
early 1840 s examined many broken axles especially after versailles train crash 1842 locomotive axle suddenly fractured led death over 50 passengers
showed axles failed progressive growth brittle crack shoulder other stress concentration source shaft such keyway
supported similar direct analysis failed axles joseph glynn axles failed slow growth brittle crack process now known metal fatigue
likely front axle locomotives involved versailles train crash failed similar way
rankine presented conclusions paper delivered institution civil engineers
work ignored however many engineers persisted believing stress cause re-crystallisation metal myth persisted even recent times
theory recrystallisation quite wrong inhibited worthwhile research until work william fairbairn few years later showed weakening effect repeated flexure large beams
nevertheless fatigue remained serious poorly understood phenomenon root cause many accidents railways elsewhere
still serious problem least much better understood today prevented careful design
