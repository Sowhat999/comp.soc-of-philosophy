1977 2003 faculty university washington seattle
first president institute electrical electronics engineers ieee neural networks council now ieee computational intelligence society editor-in-chief ieee transactions neural networks
frequent participant cross disciplinary research marks co-authored over 200 collaborators published over 50 different journals
fellow ieee optical society america
evolutionary informatics lab website controversy main article evolutionary informatics lab 2007 marks created baylor university server website evolutionary informatics lab site promoting intelligent design
website initially hosted baylor servers deleted baylor's administration determined violated university policy forbidding professors creating impression their personal views represent baylor institution
baylor permit marks repost website their server provided 108 word disclaimer accompany any intelligent design-advancing research make clear work does represent university's position
site now resides third-party server still contains material advancing intelligent design
additional controversy arose discovered william dembski notable intelligent design proponent former baylor staff member heart previous intelligent design controversy baylor over michael polanyi center's promotion intelligent design removed center's director returned baylor member evolutionary informatics lab
dembski's participation funded $30000 grant lifeworks foundation funded administrated researcher brendan dixon biologic institute another lab promoting intelligent design affiliated discovery institute

technical contributions marks researcher area electrical engineering
treatment prostate cancer
marks colleagues developed algorithms real time identification placement radioactive seeds cancerous prostates
work co-recipient judith stitt best abstract award american brachytherapy society
algorithm used clinically
optimal detection
field detection theory marks colleagues developed first closed form solution neyman–pearson optimal detection signals non-gaussian noise marks wise haldeman whited derived exact expressions test statistic distribution functions thus able analyze performance optimal detector given values signal strength sample size
power load forecasting using neural networks
colleagues university washington marks first apply artificial neural network forecast power demands utilities
six years later neural networks being used major north american utilities remains common use today
ieee sponsors matlab based webinar use neural networks load forecasting
technique similar already used successfully forecast electrical load needs used forecast dow jones closing values using data millions twitter messages
concerning success technology introduced paper marks my wife’s grandfather fond saying known how long lived taken better care himself
known how successful load forecasting paper become spent time polishing
convolutional neural networks
homma atlas marks developed temporal convolutional neural network used widely image video recognition
signal display time frequency
zhao-atlas-marks time-frequency distribution
zam distribution zamd originally called cone shaped time-frequency distribution
zamd special case cohen's class time-frequency distributions
zamd currently matlab time-frequency toolbox national instruments' lab view tools time-frequency time-series wavelet analysis zhao–atlas–marks distribution produces good resolution time frequency domains
zamd method reduces interference resulting cross-terms present multi-component signals
useful resolving close spectral peaks capturing non-stationary multi-component signals
[t]he zhao-atlas-marks time-frequency distribution
significantly enhances time frequency resolution eliminates undesirable cross terms
// zam distribution applied speech remarkable results
remote sensing
marks colleagues first use neural network inversion remote sensing
measured snow parameters microwave measurements made satellites
their general approach widely used today
wireless arrays
marks co-recipient nasa tech brief pioneering power efficient communication wireless arrays
power generation
working southern california edison marks colleagues pioneered computational intelligence based methods early detection intermittent shorted windings multi ton electric generators while rotors still turning
[their diagnostic test performs] detection localization shorted turns dc field winding turbine-generator rotors using novelty detection fuzzified neural networks
use neural networks fuzzy logic outputs traveling wave techniques
accurate locator shorted turns turbo-generator rotors
marks made number contributions sampling theorem including authoring first book exclusively dedicated subject
restoration lost samples
using sophisticated estimation missing samples using previous future samples marks first showed signal sampled above nyquist rate lost samples redundant sense any finite number them obtained remaining ones solving system linear equations
ill-posed sampling
sampling theorem's cheung–marks theorem shows samples taken signal above nyquist rate may prove incapable restoring signal presence small amounts noise
optimal image sampling
cheung marks also first showed images sampled below their nyquist rate still recovered without aliasing
their very interesting multidimensional construction
exploit[s] [required] spectral gaps occur sampling multidimensional signals
their approach slice spectrum narrow bands handle separately those bands contain signal energy those
system representation using samples
marks colleagues showed continuous dynamic systems characterized using sampling theorem
techniques developed walkup marks their co-workers whereby shift-variant transformation separated number discrete operations
// marks et al
derived generalized sampling theorem gives
rates necessary dealing shift-variant operations
// marks [also] proposed number processors based temporally multiplexing impulse response
optical computers
marks invented implemented optical computer using lenses mirrors light laser performs iterative calculations literally speed light
while many problems optics solved projections difficult solve such problems using all-optical methods
notable exception marks' all-optical implementations convex projection algorithm implementing super-resolution
christianity marks served faculty adviser university washington's chapter campus crusade christ seventeen years
presented talk does calculus christianity? poland japan canada russia united states
marks made science-oriented christian apologetics presentations
venues include poland japan moscow canada siberia
