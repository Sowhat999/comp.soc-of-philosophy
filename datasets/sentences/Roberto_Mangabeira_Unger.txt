social theory situation task unger argues classical social theory born proclaiming society made imagined expression underlying natural order
same time however argues social theory burdened equally prevalent ambition create law-like explanations history social development
human science developed out classical social theory claimed identify small number possible types social organization coexisted succeeded another through inescapable developmental tendencies deep-seated economic organization psychological constraints
marxism star example
unger argues conventional social science theories fall two types deep-structure social theory positive social science
former make distinction routine practices underlying institutional contexts shape those practices
same time however deep-structure social theory couples distinction indivisible types organization deep seated constraints developmental laws thus limiting possibilities human social development
positive social science rather sees society history endless series episodes problem solving
led according unger either social sciences adhering script history forsaking any attempt explanation favor detailing conflict resolution
false necessity main article false necessity having made critique social theory unger's next task reconstruct way resist typologies necessitarian nature conventional deep-structure social theory avoid failure positive social sciences explain world

unger began formulating theory false necessity claims social worlds artifact human endeavors
there no pre-set institutional arrangement societies must adhere there no necessary historical mold development will follow
rather free choose create forms paths our societies will take
however does give license absolute contingency

these forms basis social structure unger calls formative context
explain how move formative context another without conventional social theory constraints historical necessity e
feudalism capitalism while remaining true key insight individual human empowerment anti-necessitarian social thought unger recognized there infinite number ways resisting social institutional constraints lead infinite number outcomes

december 2015 third volume politics plasticity power comparative-historical studies institutional conditions economic military success unger provides historical materials drew formulate theory developed first two volumes
three key puzzles history human societies frame discussion
first puzzle how societies found solutions avoid constant plague reversion monetary economy back natural economy how europe able create conditions forever closed off reversion
second puzzle protection problem how societies created means use wealth pay violence well how employed violence garner wealth
third puzzle how societies able achieve military superiority
strung throughout discussion these three puzzles heart argument book there no singular necessary path social economic military development
means western european societies garnered economic military advantages over rest world occurred through haphazard contingent organization activities sectors society through given set necessary sufficient conditions
thus answer first puzzle unger shows western europe broke through reversion cycle because elites fragmented independent class producers flourish freely enabling industrial innovation protodemocratic development
key here lack involvement state behalf elite thus allowing peasants independent producers fight out avoid succumbing protection subjugation landholding elite
discussion second problem relation wealth violence unger shows european innovation traditional solutions securing wealth against violence using wealth obtain violence combination public financing military entrepreneurship allowed states mobilize wealth manpower secure borders project economic imperatives
achieve such goal however states strong elites fragmented
even then such outcome inevitable seen case seventeenth-century dutch state quite wealthy invest military development subsequently overcome britain

social sciences humanities today social sciences humanities today succumbed sway three impulses stagnate their development curtail their transformative power
these rationalizing humanizing escapist impulses
rationalization contemporary social scientists rationalize present social order natural state arrangements see victor competition failed alternatives
practice social scientists merely explain why current institutional landscape way without recognizing social arrangements under exploration product particular historical time place
laws generate therefore cannot universal laws human societies once institutional context changes these laws will no longer valid
humanization political legal thought today operates premise cannot change society fundamentally thus should strive make humanely better imperfect world
rather restructuring foundations cause inequality insecurity those aim humanize world advocate compensatory transfers wealth governments attenuate inequalities insecurities market economy
unger those political legal theorists limit themselves humanizing present order suffer poverty imagination structural change false view must choose humanization reform edges revolution substitution whole system another
unger responds need choose revolution humanization because societies indivisible systems standing falling together thus bring their piecemeal reconstruction
escapism merely describes explores adventures consciousness bear no relation confronting problems remaking social order
escapists focus spiritual adventurism while giving up institutions practices society
response unger argues structures inviting change others mistaken pessimistically believe universal maxim structures unchangeable enemies our transcendent spirits
transformative vocation unger argues there three ideas work society work honorable calling work instrumental work transformative vocation
work honorable calling idea labor enables individual…to support family provides most important sustaining relations
instrumental conception work idea work lacks any intrinsic authority nor any power own confer dignity direction human life
final conception work connects self-fulfillment transformation
conception one's work struggle against defects limits existing society available knowledge
those such transformative vocations find self-fulfillment service society combine resistance becomes price salvation
argues idea transformative vocation insurgent growing idea world waging largely mute spiritual struggle against other two notions work
legal thought unger's work law intimately connected thinking social theory
contrast contemporary legal scholarship puts courts jurists forefront legal analysis unger takes law site institutional imagination
many ways attempts recover idea german historicists[who?] [clarification needed] law life people
argues each area social life organized according certain practices—such market economy property rights—and codified law same time these codes sets ideal projected onto social life meant enacted
[citation needed] there four moments unger's work law except last captured major publications topic
first moment corresponds first book law law modern society places law realm social theory categorize different types legal systems human history analyze their historical trajectory devoid necessary attachment institutional structures
next moment came height critical legal studies movement unger laid out constructive path forward movement proposal intellectual program
third moment publication should legal analysis become? call take law legal analysis rationalizing preservation our contemporary arrangements rather terrain re-imagining our social political economic institutions whereby propose our social ideals
most recent development unger's thinking law best captured public lectures shows how mobilize law series ideals society
law modern society towards criticism social theory unger's first book law explored connection law codes arrangement social institutions
work asked why modern societies legal systems distinctions institutions such legislature court special caste lawyers possessing method reasoning social problems
further broadened inquiry question why these practices first emerged western europe
theorists such marx weber argued such legal arrangements product economic necessity secure property rights autonomy individual—in other words necessary capitalism emerge
unger rejects such determinism arguing law modern society system private rights based necessity effectiveness moral superiority rather result particular contingent political cultural development
emerged europe result tradition natural law universality due indeterminate relations monarchy aristocracy bourgeoisie
unger's argument began asserting liberal legal order holds equal before law strips ruler any immunity shows law artifact rather divine right

critical legal studies early work historical analysis law legal thought laid basis unger's contribution critical legal studies movement
movement itself born late 1970 s among young legal scholars harvard law school denounced theoretical underpinnings american jurisprudence legal realism
participants committed shaping society based vision human personality without hidden interests class domination legal institutions
two tendencies movement developed radical indeterminacy criticized law meaning anything want mean other neo-marxist critique attacked legal thought institutional form capitalism
unger offered third tendency constructive vision rethinking rights based individual emancipation empowerment structural arrangements lend themselves constant revision goal creating educational economic opportunities people
laid out critical legal studies movement quickly earned following philosophical mentor prophet movement
should legal analysis become? last book law should legal analysis become? unger leveled radical critique current legal profession put forth comprehensive program how law legal thought function place ideal civilization takes detailed institutional form
work along annual chorley lecture delivered london school economics 1995 subsequently published modern law review unger's most explicit articulation idea contemporary lack structural alternatives call law serve institutional imagination remaking society politics economy
unger calls law third moment inform us society live imagine alternative futures argue them
begins assessment our contemporary institutional intellectual arrangements arguing trapped static system does allow innovation experimentation social economic life intellectual tools available us up task attempting reinvent possibilities
then turns discussion how law legal analysis conceived nineteenth century site shaping free political order combining rights choice rules designed ensure enjoyment those rites perverted twentieth century dogmatic adherence certain system rules rights preservation through politics
legal thought today unger argues rationalization existing rules doctrines make up contemporary arrangements terms rationalizing legal analysis
bereft imaginative innovative force unger argues rationalizing legal analysis works uncover sees latent principles existing law
cannot rethink our social economic political arrangements
final move offer vision legal analysis towards such rethinking
undertaking calls mapping criticism radical analyst will uncover ideologies buried law looking particular cases see how adheres ideological position thus show how professed importance issue actually masks other ideals interests
unlike rational legal analysis does show good face law rather disharmonies how ideals get truncated order fulfill institutional form
unger then positive work legal analysis institutional imagination run up against laws circumvent institutional obstacles
economic thought center unger's thought economy commitment reimagining remaking institutional arrangements how humans produce exchange
unger economic institutions no inherent natural forms
rejects necessitarian tendencies classical neo-classical economists seeks alternatives arrangements assumptions contemporary societies
writings aimed revise ideas importance market economies division labor workplace national global economies
critique economics unger's critique economics begins identification key moment economic history analysis production exchange turned away social theory engaged quest scientific objectivity
unger’s analysis classical economics focused causal relations among social activities connected production distribution wealth
classical economists asked questions true basis value activities contributed national wealth systems rights forms government under people grow rich
late-nineteenth century response attacks socialist ideas debates how society works means escape conundrums value theory answer how values become prices marginalist economics arose
movement economics disengaged economics prescriptive normative commitments withdraw study economies debates how society worked kind society wanted live
unger moment history economics robbed any analytical practical value
unger’s critique marginalism begins walras’ equilibrium theory attempted achieve certainty economic analysis putting aside normative controversies social organization
unger finds three weaknesses crippled theory foremost theory claimed equilibrium spontaneously generated market economy
reality self-adjusting equilibrium fails occur
second theory puts forth determinate image market
historically however market shown indeterminate different market arrangements
third polemical use efficiency fails account differences distribution among individuals classes generations
consequences marginalist movement profound study economics unger says
most immediate problem under generalizing tendency economics there no means incorporate empirical evidence thus re-imagine world develop new theories new directions
way discipline self-referential theoretical
furthermore lack normative view world curtails ability propose anything policy prescription definition assumes given context
discipline rationalize world support status quo
lastly unger finds turn economics ended up universalizing debates macroeconomics leaving discipline without any historical perspective
consequence example keynes’ solution particular historical crisis turned general theory should understood response particular situation
reorientating economics unger's vision economics cannot unhinged ideas individual social life
human activity political organization must incorporated any analysis trade economies
remaking discipline hecalls return normative practice classical economics stripped necessitarian assumptions typological references
development explanatory claims prescriptive ideas necessary
discipline must connect transformation nature society—the making things reorganization people
free trade reimagined world division labor method economics sets forth six ideas begin thinking economic activity
problem specialization discovery
competition comes inhibit self transformation trading partners unequal radically unequal both forced cost cutting rather innovating increasing efficiency
problem politics over economics
making implementation policy discovery rather top down implementation
rigid state control will limit how society respond tensions crisis thus politics creates own presuppositions limits creativity alternative solutions
free trade should strengthen capacity self transformation organizing trading regime way strengthens capacity trading partners experiment innovate
becomes question how much free trade kind
best arrangements those impose least amount restraint
alternative free trade
market no necessary natural form
market economy organized different way then universal order free trade among market economies
division labor remade
pin factory organization labor describes organization work labor machine
make machines work
should then innovate those areas don't yet know how make machine work
production should collective learning permanent innovation
mind against context
mind both machine anti-machine both formulaic totalizing
thus never rest any context need arrangements constantly lend themselves reinvention
reconstructing economic institutions unger economy device wealth also permanent innovation discovery
should allow greatest freedom recombination people resources allow people innovate institutional settings
market economy should single dogmatic version itself
unger presented number general institutional proposals aim restructure world trade regime introduce new alternatives market economy
international global trade unger calls need experiment different property rights regimes multiple forms will coexist same market system tied individual property rights contractual labor
generally rather maximizing free trade goal unger sees need build open world economy way reconciles global openness national regional diversification deviation heresy experiment idea support alternatives making world safer them
national economies rejects need require free flow capital there times may necessary restrict capital flows
rather puts emphasis free flow people
labor should allowed move freely throughout world
twenty-first-century economic stimulus most recently you tube video titled beyond stimulus you tube laid out three key policies address current economy change arrangements finance relation production finance service production
tax regulate discourage finance does contribute production
use public capital venture capital funds
broaden economic opportunity supporting small medium enterprise
reject government regulation state controlled models
support cooperation government firms cooperation competition among firms
system schools meet needs vibrant flexible economy
vocational schools teach general concepts flexibility job-specific skills
illusions necessity economic order unger's first writing economic theory article illusions necessity economic order may 1978 issue american economic review
article makes case need contemporary economic thought imitate classical political economy theories exchange should incorporated theories power perception
article articulates problem american economy inability realize democracy production community workplace
failure according unger result lack comprehensive program encompasses production society state immediate attempts address inequality get swallowed up appropriated status quo course winning immediate gains organization constituency e
realize democracy workplace abolition wealth poverty unger argues need relate program worker community democracy enlargement democracy national level—the goal cannot economic production worker's rights must accompanied national project structural level
pushes idea further calling just restructuring relationship firm state based private property also replaced new set rights encompassing access jobs markets capital
private rights phased out rights decentralized decision making market exchange extended workers
needs accompanied limits size enterprise how profits used control others' labor
neoclassical economics up task because begins preconceived standards applies explain empirical data while leaving out theoretical anomaly there no causal basis analysis unger says rather everything embedded timeless universal without any account context
furthermore ambiguity concepts maximization efficiency rationalization pin analysis certain notion behavior rationalizing individual making analysis either tautological reduced set power relations translated language material exchange
programmatic thought key unger's thinking need re-imagine social institutions before attempting revise them
calls program programmatic thought
building program however must entertain complete revolutionary overhaul lest plagued three false assumptions typological fallacy fallacy there closed list institutional alternatives history such feudalism capitalism
there natural form society specific result piecemeal institutional changes political movements cultural reforms well accidents coincidences history came before
indivisibility fallacy most subscribers revolutionary leftism wrongly believe institutional structures must stand fall together
however structures reformed piecemeal
determinism fallacy fallacy uncontrollable little understood law-like forces drive historical succession institutional systems
however there no natural flow history
make ourselves our world any way choose
think social transformation programmatically must first mark direction wants society move then identify first steps move direction
way formulate proposals points along trajectory relatively close how things now relatively far away
provides third way revolution reform
revolutionary reform revolutionary vision acts vision sequence piecemeal reforms
unger puts transformative politics blueprints pathways
architecture music
two lefts unger sees two main lefts world today recalcitrant left humanizing left
recalcitrant left seeks slow down march markets globalization return time greater government involvement stronger social programs
humanizing ‘reformist’ left accepts world present form taking market economy globalization unavoidable attempts humanize their effects through tax-and-transfer policies
unger finds two major orientations contemporary leftism inadequate calls 'reconstructive left' insist redirecting course globalization reorganizing market economy
two books left alternative future american progressivism unger lays out program democratize market economy deepen democracy
reconstructive left look beyond debates appropriate size government instead re-envision relationship government firms market economy experimenting coexistence different regimes private social property
committed social solidarity refuse allow our moral interests social cohesion [to] rest solely upon money transfers commanded state form compensatory retrospective redistribution case federal entitlement programs

unger's proposal political democracy calls high energy system diminishes dependence change upon crisis
done claims breaking constant threat stasis institutionalization politics parties through five institutional innovations
first increase collective engagement through public financing campaigns giving free access media outlets
second hasten pace politics breaking legislative deadlock through enabling party power push through proposals reforms opposition parties able dissolve government call immediate elections
third option any segment society opt out political process propose alternative solutions own governance
fourth give state power rescue oppressed groups unable liberate themselves through collective action
fifth direct participatory democracy active engagement purely terms financial support wealth distribution through people directly involved their local national affairs through proposal action
philosophy core unger's philosophy two key conceptions first infinity individual secondly singularity world reality time
premise behind infinity individual exist within social contexts roles these contexts may define us—we overcome them
unger's terms both context-bound context-transcending appear embodied spirit infinite imprisoned within finite
unger there no natural state individual social being
rather infinite spirit unbound become
such no social institution convention contain us
while institutions exist shape our beings our interactions change both their structure extent imprison us
philosophy singularity world reality time establishes history site decisive action through propositions there real world multiple simultaneous universes time really exists world simulacrum through must experience world
these ideas put kant legacy trial reaffirm openness future through insight actual imagination possible
these two concepts infinity reality lie heart unger's program calling metaphysical institutional revolutions
insist embodiment spirit world means routines cannot penetrate transform must broken done changing our social institutions wholly new ways leave open possibilities allow experimentalism life social structures
see individual context transcending means must able recreate our context done singular world within time real
self human nature main article passion essay personality passion essay personality unger explores individual relation society perspective root human predicament need establish oneself unique individual world same time find commonality solidarity others
exploration grounded unger calls modernist image human being lives context bound context
unger's aim level critique expansion defense modern thinking human society practice better withstand criticisms philosophy since hume kant leveled against
religion human condition unger written spoken extensively religion human condition
religion unger argues vision world within anchor our orientation life
within orientation deal our greatest terrors highest hopes
because doomed die hope eternal life because unable grasp totality existence universe try dispel mystery provide comprehensible explanation because insatiable desire cry object worthy desire infinite
humans initially invested religious discourse nature human susceptibility nature
societies evolved people developed ways cope unpredictability nature emphasis religion shifted social existence defects
new moment religion will begin unger argues stop telling ourselves will fine begin face incorrigible flaws human existence
future religion lies embracing our mortality our groundlessness
unger sees four flaws human condition
our mortality facing imminent death our groundlessness unable grasp solution enigma existence see beginning end time nor put off discovery meaning life our insatiability want demand infinite finite our susceptibility belittlement places us position constantly confront petty routine forcing us die many little deaths
there three major responses history human thought these flaws escape humanization confrontation
overcoming world denies phenomenal world distinctions including individual
proclaims benevolence towards others indifference suffering change
achieves serenity becoming invulnerable suffering change
religion buddhism philosophical thought plato schopenhauer best represent orientation
humanization world creates meaning out social interactions meaningless world placing emphasis our reciprocal responsibility another
confucianism contemporary liberalism represent strand thought both aim soften cruelties world
struggle world framed idea series personal social transformations increase our share attributes associated divine give us larger life
emphasizes love over altruism rejecting moral mastery self-interest enhance solidarity emphasizing humility individual love
orientation articulated two different voices sacred voice judaism christianity islam profane voice secular projects liberation
religion future spiritual orientation struggle world given rise secular movements emancipation modern world here unger sees religion future
problem unger sees however established religion orientation betrayed ideological underpinnings made peace existing order
accepted hierarchies class structure society accepted transfer money serving basis solidarity reaffirmed basis existing political economic social institutions investing conservative position their preservation
thus faithful made orientation persuasive powerful first place must radicalize against both established institutions dominant beliefs
unger's call revolution our religious beliefs encompasses both individual transformation institutional reorganization create change life individual well organization society
first part program individual transformation means waking dazed state live our lives recognizing our mortality groundlessness without turning feel good theologies philosophies
second part program social transformation means supplementing metaphysical revolution institutional practices creating social institutions allow us constantly overthrow our constraints our context make overthrow time event continuing process
program empowered democracy calls reforms market economy education politics civil society
goal humanize society divinize humanity
raise ordinary life higher level intensity capability
natural philosophy unger's philosophy space time argues singularity world reality time
arguments grounded tradition natural philosophy
takes newtonian idea independent observer standing outside time space addresses skepticism david hume rejects position kant attacks speculations parallel universes contemporary cosmology
stake laying foundations view world causality open possibilities closed system options our future governed deterministic laws typologies
understanding society rejects naturalness necessity current social arrangements form understanding society history refuses explain present arrangements manner vindicates their naturalness necessity
thesis singularity world states there real world
such thesis stands stark contrast contemporary theoretical physics cosmology speculate multiple universes out dilemma how law like explanations universe unique—laws will universal because don't just apply unique universe universes
however there no empirical evidence multiple worlds
unger's singularity thesis better address our empirical observations set conceptual platform address four main puzzles cosmology today big bang initial conditions horizon problem precise value constants such gravity speed light planck's constant
thesis time real states time really real everything subject history
move historicize everything even laws nature challenge our acting time real too real—we act somewhat real otherwise there no causal relations real laws change
unger holds time real laws nature also subject force too must change
there no eternal laws upon change occurs rather time precedes structure
position gives universe history makes time non-emergent global irreversible continuous
bringing these two thesis together unger theorizes laws nature develop together phenomenon explain
laws initial conditions co-evolve same how cells reproduce mutate different levels complexity organisms
cosmological terms unger explains passing structure another origins universe state energy high infinite freedom movement greater operating under known set laws
conditions early universe compatible universe preceded
new universe may different structure made existed old e
masses elementary particles strength different forces cosmological constants
universe cools phenomena laws work together materials produced sequence path dependent materials
also constrained family resemblances effective laws against background conceptions alternative states universe succession universes
mathematics real time-drenched world consequence these positions unger points revision concept function mathematics
there world drenched time through through then mathematics cannot timeless expression multiple universes captures reality
rather unger argues mathematics means analyzing world removed time phenomenal distinction
emptying world time space able better focus aspect reality recurrence certain ways pieces world relate other pieces
subject matter structured wholes bundles relations see outside mathematics embodied time-bound particulars manifest world
way mathematics extends our problem solving powers extension human insight part world
political engagement roberto mangabeira unger speaking brazil 2007 minister strategic affairs unger long history political activity brazil

driving unger's political engagement idea society made remade
unlike mill marx posited particular class agent history unger does see single vehicle transformative politics
advocates world-wide revolution does see happening single cataclysmic event undertaken class agent like communist movement
rather sees possibility piecemeal change institutions replaced time permanent plasticity built institutional infrastructure
early political activity 1970 s 1980 s unger's engagement brazilian politics began late 1970 s brazil started democratize
1979 presented himself main opposition party brazilian democratic movement mdb appointed chief staff party leader ulysses guimaraes

military regime dissolved two-party system established multi-party system later year unger worked unite progressive liberals independent non-communist left brazilian democratic movement party pmdb
co-founder party authored first manifesto
unger left party after rise conservative faction part mdb excluded initial formation pmdb
after departing pmdb early 1980 s unger began looking political agents serve vehicles national alternative
1981 jointed democratic labour party brazil pdt led leonel brizola former governor rio de janeiro figure left prior dictatorship
brizola founded pdt unger saw authentic opposition military regime

none votes came slums however
votes come middle class although never campaigned those neighborhoods constituency
recalling experience unger says kind absurd
no money no staff go these slums alone hand out pamphlets often local drug pushers
experience unger cites leading belief system possibilities much open previously imagined
unger served brizola's campaign organizer primary political adviser bids brazilian presidency 1989 1994
1989 brizola finished third place losing second position qualified runoff against fernando collor de mello very narrow margin luiz inácio lula da silva
brizola unger both supported lula second round election collor go beat lula win presidency

unger written next step alternative neoliberalism gomes 1996
national level 2002 again second round election unger supported lula went defeat josé serra win presidency
experience supporting others imploded politically unger discovered put committing classic mistake philosophers politics try find someone else work
2000 ran primaries mayor sao paulo pps party leader suspended primaries became clear unger win nomination challenge party control

unger's work office attempt enact program
seeing future small enterprises advocating rotating capital fund function like government run venture capital fund pushed rapid expansion credit smaller producers decentralized network technical support centers help broaden middle class below
further called political solutions broaden access production forces such information technology states focus equipping monitoring civil society rather trying provide social services
