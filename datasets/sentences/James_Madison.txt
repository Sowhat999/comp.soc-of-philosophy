during these final years house delegates madison grew increasingly frustrated saw excessive democracy
criticized tendency delegates cater particular interests their constituents even such interests destructive state large
particular troubled law denied diplomatic immunity ambassadors other countries law legalized paper money
thought legislators should disinterested act interests their state large even contradicted wishes constituents

wood notes governmental structure both virginia plan final constitution innovative since copied british government used states since 1776 numerous authors already argued their adoption national level
controversial elements virginia plan removed rest commonly accepted necessary functional government state national decades hence madison's contribution considered qualitative
wood argues like most national politicians late 1780 s madison believed problem less articles confederation nature state legislatures
believed solution restrain excesses states
required alteration articles confederation required change character national compact
ultimate question before convention wood notes how design government whether states should remain sovereign whether sovereignty should transferred national government whether constitution should settle somewhere
those like madison thought democracy state legislatures excessive insufficiently disinterested wanted sovereignty transferred national government while those like patrick henry think problem wanted fix articles confederation
madison among few delegates wanted deprive states sovereignty completely considered solution problem
though sharing same goal madison most other delegates reacted strongly against such extreme change status quo
though madison lost most battles over how amend virginia plan most importantly over exclusion council revision process increasingly shifted debate away position pure state sovereignty
since most disagreements over include constitution ultimately disputes over balance sovereignty states national government madison's influence critical
wood notes madison's ultimate contribution designing any particular constitutional framework shifting debate toward compromise shared sovereignty national state governments

omission bill rights became main argument anti-federalists against constitution
though no state conditioned ratification constitution bill rights several states came close issue almost prevented constitution being ratified
anti-federalists continued contest after constitution ratified threatened entire nation another constitutional convention
likely far partisan first
madison objected specific bill rights several reasons thought unnecessary since purported protect against powers federal government granted dangerous since enumeration rights might taken imply absence other rights state level bills rights proven useless paper barriers against government powers
though few new congress wanted debate possible bill rights next century most thought declaration independence first ten constitutional amendments constituted true bill rights madison pressed issue
congress extremely busy setting up new government most wanted wait system show defects before amending constitution anti-federalist movements demanded new convention died out quickly once constitution ratified
