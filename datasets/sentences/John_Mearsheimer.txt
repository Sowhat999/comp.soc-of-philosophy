conventional deterrence mearsheimer's first book conventional deterrence 1983 addresses question how decisions start war depend projected outcome military conflict
other words how decision makers' beliefs outcome war affect success failure deterrence? mearsheimer's basic argument deterrence likely work potential attacker believes successful attack will unlikely costly
potential attacker however reason believe attack will likely succeed entail low costs then deterrence likely break down
now widely accepted way principle deterrence works
specifically mearsheimer argues success deterrence determined strategy available potential attacker
lays out three strategies
first war-of-attrition strategy entails high level uncertainty outcome war high costs attacker
second limited-aims strategy entails fewer risks lower costs
third blitzkrieg strategy provides way defeat enemy rapidly decisively relatively low costs
mearsheimer failures modern battlefield due mostly potential attacker's belief successfully implement blitzkrieg strategy tanks other mechanized forces employed swiftly effect deep penetration disrupt enemy's rear
other two strategies unlikely lead deterrence failures because entail low probability success accompanied high costs war attrition limited gains possibility conflict turning war attrition limited aims
attacker coherent blitzkrieg strategy available however attack likely ensue potential benefits outweigh costs risks starting war
besides analyzing cases world war ii arab-israeli conflict mearsheimer extrapolates implications theory prospects conventional deterrence central europe during late cold war
here argues soviet attack unlikely because soviet military unable successfully implement blitzkrieg strategy
balance forces difficulty advancing rapidly mechanized forces through central europe formidable nato forces opposing such soviet attack made unlikely mearsheimer's view soviets start conventional war europe
nuclear proliferation nuclear deterrence 1990 mearsheimer published essay predicted europe revert multipolar environment similar first half twentieth century american soviet forces left following end cold war
another article year atlantic predicted multipolar environment increase nuclear proliferation europe especially germany
essay 1993 foreign affairs article case ukrainian nuclear deterrent argued reduce dangers war united states should encourage germany ukraine develop nuclear arsenal while working prevent rise hyper-nationalism
mearsheimer presented several possible scenarios post-cold-war europe american russian forces departed
believed europe nuclear proliferation most likely remain peace because without nuclear deterrent germany likely once try conquer continent see pages 32–33
mearsheimer argued strategically unwise ukraine surrender nuclear arsenal remnants soviet stockpile
however 1994 ukraine consented rid entire former soviet nuclear stockpile process complete 1996
challenged former assertion lecture given international politics department university wales aberystwyth maintained spite european integration expansion still believed predictions come true united states military left europe
also op-ed pieces written 1998 2000 new york times mearsheimer supported india's decision acquire nuclear weapons
support position argued india good strategic reasons want nuclear deterrent especially order balance against china pakistan guaranteeing regional stability
also criticized united states counter-proliferation policy towards india considered unrealistic harmful american interests region
offensive neorealism mearsheimer leading proponent offensive neorealism
structural theory unlike classical realism hans morgenthau places principal emphasis security competition among great powers within anarchy international system principally human nature statesmen diplomats
contrast another structural realist theory defensive neorealism kenneth waltz offensive neorealism maintains states satisfied given amount power seek hegemony security because anarchic makeup international system creates strong incentives states seek opportunities gain power expense competitors
mearsheimer summed view up 2001 book tragedy great power politics given difficulty determining how much power enough today tomorrow great powers recognize best way ensure their security achieve hegemony now thus eliminating any possibility challenge another great power
misguided state pass up opportunity hegemon system because thought already sufficient power survive
also dismissed democratic peace theory claims democracies never rarely go war another
[citation needed] mearsheimer does believe possible state become global hegemon because there too much landmass too many oceans posits effective stopping power act giant moats
instead believes states achieve regional hegemony
furthermore argues states attempt prevent other states becoming regional hegemons since peer competitors interfere state's affairs
states achieved regional hegemony such u
will act offshore balancers interfering other regions great powers those regions able prevent rise hegemon
2004 speech mearsheimer praised british historian e
carr 1939 book twenty years' crisis argued carr correct claimed international relations struggle against states placing their own interests first
mearsheimer maintained carr's points still relevant 2004 1939 went deplore claimed dominance idealist thinking international relations among british academic life
gulf war january early february mearsheimer published two op-eds chicago tribune new york times arguing war liberate kuwait iraqi forces should quick lead decisive us victory less 1000 american casualties
view countered conventional wisdom start war predicted conflict lasting months costing thousands american lives
mearsheimer's argument based several points
first iraqi army third world military unprepared fight mobile armored battles
second us armored forces better equipped trained
third us artillery also far better iraqi counterpart
fourth us airpower unfettered weak iraqi air force should prove devastating against iraqi ground forces
fifth finally forward deployment iraqi reserves boded ill their ability counter us efforts penetrate iraqi defense line along saudi-kuwaiti border
these predictions came true course war
noelle-neumann controversy october mearsheimer drawn bitter controversy university chicago regarding elisabeth noelle-neumann visiting professor germany
noelle-neumann prominent german pollster leading academic public opinion research authored highly regarded book “the spiral silence”
debate centered article written leo bogart called “the pollster nazis”
described noelle-neumann’s past employment writer editor nazi newspaper das reich 1940-1942
noelle-neumann’s response article claim “texts written under dictatorship 50 years ago cannot read 1937 1939 1941
severed time place written no longer real reality part based time place
chairman chicago’s political science department time mearsheimer sat down neumann discuss article allegations
after meeting her over three hours mearsheimer publicly declared “i believe noelle-neumann anti-semite” spearheaded campaign asking her apology
joined other university chicago faculty writing joint piece commentary magazine reacted noelle-neumann’s reply accusation against her
declared “by providing rhetorical support exclusion jews her words helped make disreputable reputable indecent decent uncivilized civilized unthinkable thinkable
mearsheimer knowing know now holocaust there no reason her apologize
ask somebody played contributing role greatest crime 20 th century say 'i'm sorry' unreasonable
israel lobby main article israel lobby u
foreign policy march 2006 mearsheimer stephen walt former academic dean professor international relations harvard kennedy school government published harvard university kennedy school government working paper london review books article discussing power israel lobby shaping foreign policy united states
define israel lobby loose coalition individuals organizations actively work steer us foreign policy pro-israel direction
emphasize appropriate label jewish lobby because jews feel strong attachment israel because individuals groups work foster u
support israel jewish according mearsheimer walt christian zionists play important role
finally emphasize lobby cabal conspiracy simply powerful interest group like national rifle association farm lobby
their core argument policies lobby pushes united states' national interest nor ultimately israel
those pieces generated extensive media coverage led wide-ranging often heated debate supporters opponents their argument
article subsequently turned book entitled israel lobby u
foreign policy
statements israeli wars palestinian state mearsheimer critical israel's war against lebanon summer 2006
argued israel's strategy doomed fail because based faulty assumption israeli air power defeat hezbollah essentially guerrilla force
war argued disaster lebanese people well major setback united states israel
lobby played key role enabling israel's counterproductive response preventing united states exercising independent influence
mearsheimer also critical israel's offensive against hamas gaza strip began december 2008
argued eliminate hamas's capability fire missiles rockets israel cause hamas end fight israel
fact argued relations israel palestinians likely get worse years ahead
mearsheimer emphasizes hope israel end conflict palestinians end occupation allow palestinians their own state gaza west bank
otherwise israel going turn itself apartheid state
disastrous outcome israel also united states especially palestinians
mearsheimer's criticisms israel further extended israel's possession nuclear weapons
remarks made international spy museum 2010 mearsheimer asserted nuclear israel contrary u
interests questioned israel's accountability matter stating there no accountability israel any issue because surmised israelis almost anything get away
future palestine lecture april 2010 mearsheimer delivered hisham
sharabi memorial lecture palestine center washington dc titled future palestine righteous jews vs
new afrikaners
argued two-state solution now fantasy because israel will incorporate gaza strip west bank greater israel become apartheid state
state according mearsheimer politically viable most american jews support eventually become democratic bi-national state politically dominated palestinian majority
suggested american jews care deeply israel divided three categories new afrikaners will support israel even apartheid state righteous jews believe individual rights universal apply equally jews palestinians largest group called great ambivalent middle
concludes most great ambivalent middle defend apartheid israel because american jews among staunchest defenders traditional liberal values resulting new afrikaners becoming increasingly marginalized over time
mearsheimer stated classify most individuals head israel lobby’s major organizations 'new afrikaners' specifically listed abraham foxman anti-defamation league david harris american jewish committee malcolm hoenlein conference presidents major american jewish organizations ronald lauder world jewish congress morton klein zionist organization america well businessmen such sheldon adelson lester crown mortimer zuckerman media personalities like fred hiatt charles krauthammer bret stephens martin peretz
statements gilad atzmon 2011 mearsheimer gilad atzmon's book wandering gilad atzmon written fascinating provocative book jewish identity modern world
shows how assimilation liberalism making increasingly difficult jews diaspora maintain powerful sense their 'jewishness
panicked jewish leaders argues turned zionism blind loyalty israel scaremongering threat another holocaust keep tribe united distinct surrounding goyim
atzmon's own case demonstrates strategy working causing many jews great anguish
wandering who? should widely read jews non-jews alike
writing regard charge jeffrey goldberg atzmon anti-semitic implication own positive review atzmon's work mearsheimer responded atzmon's basic point jews often talk universalistic terms many them think act particularistic terms
might say talk like liberals act like nationalists
context discusses calls holocaust religion zionism israel's treatment palestinians
again perfectly clear no animus toward judaism religion individuals jewish birth
jon chait others responded mearsheimer quoting explicitly antisemitic quotations atzmon's book play timeless antisemitic stereotypes canards
rise containment china mearsheimer asserts china's rise will peaceful u
will seek contain china prevent achieving regional hegemony
believes china will attempt dominate asia-pacific region just asserts u
set out dominate western hemisphere
motivation doing gain position overwhelming security superiority against neighbors sees potential challengers status
additionally maintains u
will attempt form balancing coalition consists primarily india japan philippines south korea vietnam indonesia counter growing strength power projection capabilities china
points increased alliances warming u
–vietnam u
–india relations evidence
mearsheimer asserts australia should concerned china's accretion power because will lead intense security competition china us destabilize region
also argues china implementing militarily aggressive philosophy u
naval strategist alfred thayer mahan argued sea control decisive battle
why leaders lie mearsheimer book analyzes lying international politics
argues why leaders lie oxford university press 2011 leaders lie foreign audiences well their own people because think good their country
example maintains president franklin
roosevelt lied greer incident september 1941 because deeply committed getting united states world war ii thought america's national interest
two main findings leaders actually lie very much other countries democratic leaders actually likely autocrats lie their own people
thus starts book saying surprising saddam hussein lie having wmd—he truthfully none—but george bush key advisors lie american people threat iraq
mearsheimer argues leaders most likely lie their own people democracies fight wars choice distant places
says difficult leaders lie other countries because there much trust among them especially security issues stake you need trust lying effective
says easier leaders lie their own people because there usually good deal trust them
types lies mearsheimer does consider moral dimension international lying views utilitarian perspective
argues there five types international lies
inter-state lies leader country lies leader another country generally any foreign audience induce desired reaction
fear-mongering leader lies her own domestic public
strategic cover-ups employ lies prevent controversial policies deals being made known publicly
nationalist myths stories country's past portray country positive light while adversaries negative light
liberal lies given clear up negative reputation institutions individuals actions
explains reasons why leaders pursue each these different kinds lies
central thesis leaders lie frequently domestic audiences leaders other states
because international lying negative effects including blowback backfiring
blowback telling international lies helps cause culture deceit home
backfiring telling lie leads failed policy
also emphasizes there two other kinds deception besides lying concealment leader remains silent important matter spinning leader tells story emphasizes positive downplays ignores negative
ukraine nuclear weapons ukraine after break up soviet union new independent ukraine large arsenal nuclear weapons territory
however 1994 ukraine agreed give up nuclear arms became member nuclear nonproliferation treaty within two years removed atomic weapons
almost alone among observers mearsheimer opposed decision because saw ukraine without nuclear deterrent likely subjected aggression russia
2014 crimean crisis september 2014 mearsheimer article foreign affairs highly critical american policy towards russia since conclusion cold war
mearsheimer argued russian intervention crimea ukraine motivated saw irresponsible strategic objectives nato eastern europe
compared us-led nato expansion eastern europe planned inclusion ukraine hypothetical scenario chinese military alliance north america stating imagine american outrage china built impressive military alliance tried include canada mexico
mearsheimer argued russia's annexation crimea fueled concerns lose access black sea fleet naval base sevastopol ukraine continued move towards nato european integration
mearsheimer concluded us policy should shift towards recognising ukraine buffer state nato russia rather attempting absorb ukraine nato
[citation needed] china mearsheimer critical us policy toward china regards fated engage intense security competition possible war continues steep trajectory economic growth
according mearsheimer india japan singapore south korea russia vietnam will allies united states against mega-power china’s attempt dominate
