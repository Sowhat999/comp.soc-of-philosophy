theology ritschl claimed carry work luther schleiermacher especially ridding faith tyranny scholastic philosophy
system shows influence kant's destructive criticism claims pure reason recognition value morally conditioned knowledge doctrine kingdom ends schleiermacher's historical treatment christianity regulative use idea religious fellowship emphasis importance religious feeling lotze's theory knowledge treatment personality
ritschl's work made profound impression german thought gave new confidence german theology while same time provoked storm hostile criticism
spite resistance ritschlian school grew remarkable rapidity followers dominating german theological faculties late nineteenth early twentieth centuries
perhaps mainly due bold religious positivism assumes spiritual experience real faith legitimate even paramount claim provide highest interpretation world
life trust god fact much explained explain everything else
ritschl's standpoint individual subject
objective ground bases system religious experience christian community
immediate object theological knowledge faith community positive religious datum theology constructs total view world human life
thus essence ritschl's work systematic theology
nor does painfully work up master-category given knowledge jesus revealed community
god love purpose love moral organization humanity kingdom god idea immense range application-is applied ritschl's initial datum
vantage-ground ritschl criticizes use aristotelianism speculative philosophy scholastic protestant theology
holds such philosophy too shallow theology
hegelianism attempts squeeze life categories logic aristotelianism deals things general ignores radical distinction nature spirit
neither hegelianism nor aristotelianism vital enough sound depths religious life
neither conceives god correlative human trust cf
theologie und metaphysik
ritschl's recoil carries far left alone merely practical experience
faith knows god active relation kingdom self-existent
limitation theological knowledge bounds human need might logically pressed run perilously near phenomenalism epistemology know things their activities does cover weakness
seeking ultimate reality circle active conscious sensation rules out metaphysic
indeed much part normal christian faith—e
eternity son—is passed over beyond range method
ritschl's theory value-judgments werthurtheile illustrates form agnosticism
religious judgments value determine objects according their bearing our moral spiritual welfare
imply lively sense radical human need
sort knowledge stands quite apart produced theoretic disinterested judgments
former moves world values judges things related our fundamental self-feeling
latter moves world cause effect
ritschl appears confine metaphysic category causality
theory formulated such grave ambiguities theology seen wholly based uncompromising religious realism actually charged individualistic subjectivism
ritschl clearly shown judgments value enfold transform other types knowledge just spiritual man includes transfigures does annihilate natural man then within compass spiritually conditioned knowledge other knowledge seen function home
theory value-judgments part too ultra-practical tendency both metaphysic mysticism ruthlessly condemned
faith-knowledge appears wrenched bearings suspended mid-ocean
perhaps lived see progress will-psychology might welcomed hope spiritual philosophy
illustrative examples few instances will illustrate ritschl's positive systematic theology
conception god father given community revelation
must regarded active relationship kingdom spiritual personality revealed spiritual purposiveness
love will directed towards realization purpose kingdom
righteousness fidelity purpose
god first cause moral legislator theology no concern nor interested speculative problems indicated traditional doctrine trinity
natural theology no value save leans faith
again christ religious life community unique value founder redeemer
perfect revelation god exemplar true religion
work founding kingdom personal vocation spirit communicates believers thus exalted king sustaining life kingdom
resurrection necessary part christian belief g ecke pp
divinity predicate applied faith jesus founding redeeming activity
note here though ritschl gives jesus unique unapproachable position active relation kingdom declines rise above relative teaching
two nature problem eternal relation son father no bearing experience therefore stand outside range theology
once doctrine sin redemption governing idea god's fatherly purpose family
sin contradiction purpose guilt alienation family
redemption justification regeneration adoption forgiveness reconciliation mean same thing-the restoration broken family relationship
depends mediation christ maintained filial relationship even death communicates brotherhood believers
everything defined idea family
whole apparatus forensic ideas law punishment satisfaction etc
summarily rejected foreign god's purpose love ritschl faithful standpoint religious community nothing definite say many important questions such relation god non-christians
school wilhelm herrmann julius kaftan adolf harnack chief names diverges teaching many directions e
kaftan appreciates mystical side religion harnack's criticism very different ritschl's exegesis
united value faith knowledge opposed metaphysic
