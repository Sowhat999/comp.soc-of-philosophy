iser meaning object found within text event construction occurs somewhere text reader
specifically reader comes text fixed world meaning realized through act reading how reader connects structures text his/her own experience
illustrate iser uses example constellations “the impressions arise result process will vary individual individual within limits imposed written opposed unwritten text
same way two people gazing night sky may both looking same collection stars will see image plough other will make out dipper
‘stars’ literary text fixed lines join them variable
literary work iser created reader text “converge consists two “poles” artistic object text created author aesthetic realization accomplished reader
both these poles contribute two central points iser’s theory concept “implied reader” narrative “gaps
author composing text s/he particular reader mind part represented text
reader identical real flesh-and-blood reader “a textual structure anticipating presence recipient without necessarily defining him…the concept implied reader designates network response-inviting structures impel reader grasp text
iser separates concept implied reader two “interrelated aspects reader’s role textual structure reader’s role structured act
textual structure refers reader’s point-of-view found within text
standpoint multifaceted because narrator characters plot fictitious reader offer sides
further reader’s role textual structure defined “vantage point joins [these perspectives] meeting place converge
component parts operate together shape reader’s role found within text
reader’s role structured act refers how reader fulfills textual structures causing them converge within his/her imagination
other words textual structures connected come life reader takes part reading process
does mean “real” reader simply accepts role rather he/she exists tension his/her own historical reality experience acceptance his/her role reader
“the concept implied reader expression role offered text no way abstraction derived real reader rather conditioning force behind particular kind tension produced real reader accepts role
differences real reader role fictitious reader produce tension allows different connections readings
iser literary work composed both written unwritten portions text
reader begins reading process sentences make up work inform reader literary movement produce certain expectations within mind reader
however these expectations rarely fulfilled text “full unexpected twists turns frustrations expectations…thus whenever flow interrupted led off unexpected directions opportunity given us bring play our own faculty establishing connections—for filling gaps left text itself
these gaps unwritten portion text calls reader’s participation
different readers will decide fill various gaps different ways allowing inexhaustible realizations text within provided interpretive limits
reader reflects s/he read previously text s/he rereads text new light shed happenings within narrative “certain aspects text will assume significance attach them first reading while others will recede background
thus structure text brings expectations interrupted surprising unfulfillment producing gaps require filling reader create coherent flow text
these gaps then turn cause reader reread prior events text light those gap fillings
however these gaps cannot filled arbitrarily through interpretive limits given text author
iser finds experience breakdown subject-object division “text reader no longer confront each other object subject instead ‘division’ takes place within reader himself
act reading text becomes living subject within reader
