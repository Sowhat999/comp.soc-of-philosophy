nasr abu zayd case zayd's academic work qur'an led lawsuit against conservative muslim scholars
subsequent hisbah trial led being declared apostate murtadd egyptian court
since under sharia law permissible muslim woman married non-muslim man court also declared remain married wife—cairo university french literature professor dr
ibtihal younis
decision effect forced out homeland
rejection promotion nasr abu zayd case began refused promotion post full professor
may 1992 dr
abu zayd presented academic publications standing committee academic tenure promotion advancement
among thirteen works arabic other languages imam shāfi‘ī founding medieval ideology critique religious discourse
committee presented three reports two favor promotion dr
abu zayd
third written abdel-sabour shahin professor arabic linguistics cairo dar al- 'ulum committee member accused abu zayd clear affronts islamic faith rejected promotion
despite two positive reports tenure promotion committee voted against promotion seven votes six arguing works justify promotion
council arabic department stated against committee's decision council faculty arts criticized committee report
despite council cairo university confirmed decision committee report 18 march 1993
content blocking promotion pulpit amr ibn al-`aas mosque preacher shahin publicly denounced abu zayd apostate murtadd
shortly thereafter flood vitriolic articles accusing heresy appeared mainstream semi -state press
critics case noted shahin's interest beliefs abu zayd may motivated factors other piety
addition being preacher during friday services cairo's oldest mosque host number television radio programs islam shahin active egypt's ruling party chairman religious committee consultant late 1980 s rayyan investment company
rayyan touted itself islamic financial outfit appealing pious muslims believed islam forbids them receive interest
promised pay them instead islamically sanctioned `dividends
` badly run firm went bankrupt depriving thousand egyptians their life savings
book abu zaid cited rayyan example how islamists used religious discourse ulterior motives material gain
shahin pleased criticism
forced divorce proceedings june april according another account case moved beyond cairo university group islamists led former state official muhammad samida abu samada including shahin filed lawsuit before giza lower personal status court family court cairo demanding nullification marriage abu zayd wife dr
ibtihal younis arguing islamic law forbids marriage muslim woman apostate
couple notified heard case first tabloid newspapers
court case filed through personal status law divorce because area islamic shari'a still force egyptian law
filing cases hisbah against muslims violated right god thus disturbed public order time function official known muhtasib before function lapsed
lawsuit islamists resurrected hisbah advantage plaintiffs directly affected defendant's alleged wrongdoing
hisbah principles stated article 89 110 regulations governing sharia courts egypt amended 1998 too late help abu zayd
according conservative islamist scholars cited against abu zayd plaintiffs professor `ignorant proponent enlightenment `who understand[s] freedom thought mean freedom lead people infidelity`
another called abu zayd's work `cultural aids` `intellectual terrorism
` critic himself assailed apostate several years later own religious writings
27 january 1994 giza personal status court rejected demand because plaintiff no direct personal interest matter
however june 14 1995 cairo's court appeals reversed lower court ruling favor plaintiff judge 'abd al-'alim musa worked several years saudi arabia found abu zayd apostate declaring marriage abu zayd ibtihal younis null void
reasoning judgement among other things court declared verse authorizing discriminatory jizya tax non-muslims `is subject discussion
` owning slave women allowed under certain conditions `clear` qur'anic verses `that must follow`
abu zayd also accused believing jinn genies
judgement stated defendant's proposition requirement christians jews pay jizyah poll tax constitutes reversal humanity's efforts establish better world contrary divine verses question jizyah manner considered inappropriate even temporal matters judgments notwithstanding inappropriateness dealing qur’an sunnah whose texts represent pinnacle humane generous treatment non-muslim minorities
non-muslim countries grant their muslim minorities even one-tenth rights accorded non-muslim minorities islam instead undertaking mass murder men women children step forward humanity
verse jizyah verse 29 surat al-tawbah defendant opposes subject discussion
judgment stated questioning abu zayd permissibility ownership slave girls principle considered religiously proven without doubt contrary divine texts permit such provided required conditions met
court appeals head judge 'abd al- 'alim musa fellow jurists declared abu zayd threat national security saying attacking islam attacked state founded
conservative religious interpretation court evidenced month after ruling judge alim egyptian magazine muslims required believe spirits devils throne god
examining abu zayd's work charge against disbelieving jinn scholar michael cook notes abu zayd explicitly deny existence jinn explained their reason being qur'an part appeal existing arab conceptions communication genies humans
since jinn part culture arabs time quran revealed still very much part arab folk culture without their inclusion notion divine revelation difficult accept
promotion cairo university irony story occurred cairo university promoted abu zayd full professor academic committee after reviewing works submitted dr
abu-zeid application promotion examining them both individually whole reached following conclusion prodigious academic efforts demonstrate researcher well-rooted academic field well-read our islamic intellectual traditions knowledge many branches — islamic principles theology jurisprudence sufism qur’anic studies rhetoric linguistics — rested laurels in-depth knowledge field taken forthright critical position
does attempt make critique until mastered issues before investigating them way both traditional modern methodologies
sum free thinker aspiring truth
there something urgent style stems urgency crisis contemporary arab-islamic world witnessing necessity honestly identify ills world order effective cure found
academic research should isolated social problems should allowed participate current debates suggest solutions current dilemmas allowing researchers investigate interpret far possible
reaction decision decision provoked great debate criticism abroad because violation fundamental human rights anger against abu zayd death threats egypt
abu zayd himself lamented took week my name cursed over egypt
even my village saying teaching heresies students
death threats shortly after verdict issued group professors al-azhar university theological centre egypt issued joint statement calling abu zayd's execution
egyptian islamic jihad organization assassinated egyptian president anwar sadat 1981 engaged guerrilla war government time issued statement saying professor should killed abandoning muslim faith
calls death limited insurgents
even newspaper published ruling political party ostensibly secular anti-fundamentalist regime islamic banner declared `execution` fitting penalty abu zayd failed repent
addition abu zayd received threats mail promising no matter how much police tries protect you you will get away
nasr abu zayd protected police belief apostasy widespread even police officer guarding house referred kafir asked situation neighbor abu zayd
case against decision court case based alleged apostasy nasr abu zayd hence decision based qur'anic punishment
egyptian penal code recognize apostasy civil law restricts proof apostasy two possibilities either certificate specialized religious institution certifying individual converted another religion confession individual converted
neither provided
nasr abu zayd never declared himself apostate
interview explained i'm sure i'm muslim
my worst fear people europe may consider treat me critic islam
i'm new salman rushdie don't want welcomed treated such
i'm researcher
i'm critical old modern islamic thought
treat qur'an naṣṣ text given god prophet muhammad
text put human language arabic language
accused saying prophet muhammad qur’an
crisis thought crisis conscience
furthermore number rulings egyptian court cassation seem contradicted verdict since muslim inherits his/her religion his/her parents he/she does need re-announce his/her faith
stated person muslim enough articulates belief allah prophet mohamed
judge may look seriousness incentives behind confession
necessary make public confession
accordance established course court religious belief considered spiritual matter consequently judged explicitly declared
therefore judge investigate sincerity nor motive such declared statement
court taken course established law religious belief among matters judgment should based declared statement no means should sincerity motives statement questioned
exile 23 july 1995 couple fled their homeland indefinite sabbatical
flew madrid then decided go spain netherlands invited teach visiting professor leiden university
abu zayd explained couldn't take two months around clock security
whenever someone came visit cleared
whenever wanted go out coordinate security
couldn't just go coffee shop my friends play round backgammon
kind life that? though books officially banned egypt pulled library shelves alma mater
november 1999 filed suit against egyptian justice minister demanding 1996 ruling annulled marriage declared illegal
legacy egyptian government strived ignore case
there brief mentions state-run media no government official spoke defense
however 1998 regulations governing sharia courts egypt amended making impossible individuals file lawsuits accusing someone apostasy leaving issue prerogative prosecution office
action against abu zayd isolated
during 1990 s there several assaults liberal intellectuals artists egypt elsewhere muslim world
ahmed sobhy mansour dismissed al-azhar university imprisoned six months
based verdict reached university itself grounds rejected fundamental tenet islam research truth muhammad's sayings hadith
egyptian nobel laureate naguib mahfouz stabbed neck islamist 1994 leaving incapable using hand write
egyptian courts theatre different lawsuits brought against intellectuals journalists university professors such atif al-iraqi ragaa al-naqash mahmoud al-tohami youssef chahine film el-mohager emigrant
abu zayd's case described demonstrating coercive impulse behind much islamism well unintended consequences making concessions direction those conservatives calling killing included religious figures media supposedly co-opted regime
other became suspicious collusion violent rebels conservative islamists held senior positions egypt's public institutions
gilles kepel noted case demonstration how moderate extremists islamists complemented another's actions
rather moderates undermining extremists hoped moderates such abdel-sabour shahin islamic banner singled out victims apostates then executed zayd's case provided very credible threat murder extremists such egyptian islamic jihad
moderates deplore fanaticism extremists public plead attenuating circumstance their behalf need arose
case compared controversies over interpretation quran involving taha hussein 1920 s muhammad ahmad khalafallah 1940 s
fact well established/respected scholar like abu zayd suffered concretely other two illustration gains made islamists last half 20 th century
thought according scholar navid kermani three key themes emerge abu zayd's work trace various interpretations historical settings single qur'anic text early days islam up present demonstrate interpretational diversity al-ta 'addud alta 'wili exists within islamic tradition show how diversity increasingly neglected across islamic history
abu zayd saw himself heir muʿtazila particularly their idea created qurʿān their tendency toward metaphorical interpretation
quran text abu zayd strongly opposed belief single precise valid interpretation qur'an handed down prophet times
view quran made islamic arab culture `culture text` hadarat al-nass par excellence because language quran self-explanatory implied islamic arab culture also culture interpretation hadarat al-ta'wil
abu zayd emphasized intellect `aql understanding quran opposed hermeneutical approach gives priority narrated traditions [ hadith naql
reflection abu zaid used term ta'wil interpretation efforts understand quran while islamic sciences literature explained quran referred tafsir commentary explanation
abu zaid interpretation goes beyond explanation commentary without qur'an meaning [qur'anic] text changed very first moment - prophet recited moment revelation - existence divine text nass ilahi became something understandable human text nass insani because changed revelation interpretation li-annahu tahawwala min al-tanzil ila al-ta'wil
prophet's understanding text first phases movement resulting text's connection human intellect
humanistic hermeneutics quran beginning academic career abu zaid developed renewed hermeneutic view theory methodology text interpretation qur'an further islamic holy texts arguing should interpreted historical cultural context their time
mistake many muslim scholars see qur'an text led conservatives well liberals battle quotations each group seeing clear verses their side ambiguous ones contradiction their vision
type controversy led both conservatives liberals produce authoritative hermeneutics
vision qur'an text vision elites muslim societies whereas same time qur'an oral discourse played most important part understanding masses
nasr abu zayd called another reading holy book through humanistic hermeneutics interpretation sees qur'an living phenomenon discourse
hence qur'an outcome dialogue debate despite argument acceptance rejection
liberal interpretation islam should open space new perspectives religion social change muslim societies
abu zayd's analysis finds several insistent calls social justice qur'an
example muhammad—busy preaching rich people quraysh—failed pay attention poor blind fellow named ibn umm maktūm came asking prophet advice
qur'an strongly criticizes muhammad's attitude
quran 8010
abu zayd also argued while qur'anic discourse built patriarchal society therefore addressees naturally males received permission marry divorce marry off their female relatives possible imagine muslim women receive same rights quran tendency improve women's rights
classical position modern ‘ulamā’ issue understandable still believe superiority male family
abu zayd's critical approach classical contemporary islamic discourse fields theology philosophy law politics humanism promoted modern islamic thought might enable muslims build bridge their own tradition modern world freedom speech equality minority rights women's rights social justice human rights democracy globalisation
