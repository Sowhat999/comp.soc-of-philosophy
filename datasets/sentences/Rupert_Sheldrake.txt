selected books sheldrake's books received both positive negative reviews reviews being extremely negative regarding scientific content work
2009 adam rutherford deputy editor nature criticised sheldrake's books containing research subjected peer-review process expected science suggested books best ignored
sheldrake also called robust eloquent defender science crispin tickell review financial times
1987 guardian article referred required reading new agers
new science life sheldrake's new science life hypothesis morphic resonance 1981 proposed through morphic resonance various perceived phenomena particularly biological ones become probable often occur biological growth behaviour thus become guided patterns laid down previous similar events
result suggested newly-acquired behaviours passed down future generations − biological proposition akin lamarckian inheritance theory
generalised approach assert explains many aspects science evolution laws nature sheldrake's formulation merely mutable habits evolving changing since big bang
john davy observer implications new science life fascinating far-reaching turn upside down lot orthodox science merit attention predictions supported experiment
article sheldrake guardian argued morphic resonance explained results experiments learning rats conducted william mc dougall replicated francis crew wilfred agar inheritance acquired characteristics apparently demonstrated
however since replications carried out unrelated rats sheldrake ruled out inheritance basis genetic modification explanation
concluded hypothesis formative causation unlikely widely accepted unless considerable body evidence favour
begin yield results support then
there good reason pursue further
clearly implications revolutionary
subsequent books sheldrake continued promote morphic resonance hypothesis
several these books including revised expanded edition new science life published 2009 united states under title morphic resonance nature formative causation present experimental evidence says supports hypothesis
morphic resonance hypothesis rejected numerous critics many grounds labelled pseudoscience magical thinking
these grounds include lack evidence inconsistency established scientific theories
idea morphic resonance also seen lacking scientific credibility because overly vague unfalsifiable
furthermore sheldrake's experimental methods criticised being poorly designed subject experimenter bias
analyses results also drawn criticism
[b] presence past next book presence past morphic resonance habits nature 1988 sheldrake expanded morphic resonance hypothesis marshalled experimental evidence supported hypothesis
book reviewed favourably new scientist historian theodore roszak called engaging provocative tour de force
book re-issued 2011 those quotes front cover new scientist remarked back then roszak gave sheldrake benefit doubt
today attitudes hardened sheldrake seen standing firmly wilder shores science adding new scientist review re-issue book's publisher wouldn't mining promotional purposes
david jones reviewing book times criticised hypothesis magical thinking pseudoscience saying morphic resonance vast formless easily made explain anything dodge round any opposing argument
sheldrake sadly aligned himself those fantasists depths their armchairs dream up whole new grandiose theories space time revolutionize science drape their wooly generalizations over every phenomenon think then start looking round whatever scraps evidence seem them their favour
jones argued without confirmatory experimental evidence whole unwieldy redundant structure [sheldrake's] theory falls occam's razor
rebirth nature published sheldrake's rebirth nature greening science god addressed subject new age consciousness related topics
column guardian book seeks restore pre-enlightenment notion nature 'alive' quoting sheldrake saying indeterminism spontaneity creativity re-emerged throughout natural world mystic animistic religious ways thinking no longer kept bay
book reviewed james lovelock nature argued theory formative causation makes testable predictions noting nothing yet reported divert mainstream science
even nonsense
recognizing need fruitful errors regard book dangerous
seven experiments change world 1994 sheldrake proposed list seven experiments change world subtitled do-it-yourself guide revolutionary science
encouraged lay people conduct research argued experiments similar own conducted limited expense
music critic sunday times mark edwards reviewed book positively arguing sheldrake challenges complacent certainty scientists ideas sounded ridiculous
long your thinking constrained current scientific orthodoxy
david sharp writing lancet experiments testing paranormal phenomena carried risk positive publication bias scientific community think again these suggestions convincingly confirmed
sharp encouraged readers medical professionals least read sheldrake even try experiments—but pay very close attention your methods section
sharp doubted whether bunch enthusiastic amateurs [was] going persuade sceptics noted orthodox science will need lot convincing
science journalist nigel hawkes writing times sheldrake trying bridge gap phenomenalism science suggested dogs appear psychic abilities actually relying conventional senses
concluded saying whether scientists will willing take [sheldrake] seriously
[a question] need concern most readers
while think book will change world will cause plenty harmless fun
dogs know their owners coming home seven experiments contained seed sheldrake's next book dogs know their owners coming home 1999 covered research proposed telepathy humans animals particularly dogs
sheldrake suggests such interspecies telepathy real phenomenon morphic fields responsible
book three sections telepathy sense direction including animal migration homing pigeons animal precognition including premonitions earthquakes tsunamis
sheldrake examined 1000 case histories dogs cats seemed anticipate their owners' return waiting door window sometimes half hour ahead their return
long series experiments dog called jaytee dog filmed continuously during owner's absence
100 filmed tests average dog spent far time window owner her way home she
during main period her absence before she started her return journey dog window average 24 seconds per 10-minute period 4% time whereas she her way home during first ten minutes her homeward journey five miles away dog window average five minutes 30 seconds 55% time
sheldrake interpreted result highly significant statistically
sheldrake performed 12 further tests dog's owner travelled home taxi other unfamiliar vehicle randomly selected times communicated her telephone rule out possibility dog reacting familiar car sounds routines
sheldrake also carried out similar experiments another dog kane describing results similarly positive significant
before publication dogs know their owners coming home sheldrake invited richard wiseman matthew smith julie milton conduct independent experimental study dog jaytee
concluded their evidence support telepathy explanation dog's behaviour proposed possible alternative explanations sheldrake's conclusions involving artefacts bias resulting experimental design post hoc analysis unpublished data
group observed sheldrake's observed patterns easily arise dog simply very little while before visiting window increasing frequency longer owner absent such behaviour make sense dog awaiting owner's return
under behaviour final measurement period ending owner's return contain most time spent window
sheldrake argued actual data own wiseman's tests bear out dog went wait window sooner owner returning short absence later after long absence no tendency jaytee go window early way shorter absences
reviewing book susan blackmore criticised sheldrake comparing 12 tests random duration less hour duration initial tests dog may responding patterns owner's journeys
blackmore interpreted results randomised tests starting period dog settles down does bother go window then showing longer owner away dog went look
sense being stared 2003 sheldrake published sense being stared explored telepathy precognition psychic staring effect
reported experiment sheldrake conducted blindfolded subjects guessed whether persons staring them another target
sheldrake reported subjects exhibiting weak sense being stared no sense being stared attributed results morphic resonance
sheldrake reported hit rate 53
1% describing two subjects nearly right scoring way above chance levels
several independent experimenters unable find evidence beyond statistical randomness people tell being stared saying there design flaws sheldrake's experiments such using test sequences relatively few long runs many alternations instead truly randomised patterns
2005 michael shermer expressed concern over confirmation bias experimenter bias tests concluded sheldrake's claim unfalsifiable
david jay brown conducted experiments sheldrake states subjects reported having highest hit rates under influence drug mdma ecstasy during trials

dawkins passionate believer materialist dogma book response
book sheldrake proposes number questions theme each chapter seek elaborate central premise science predicated belief nature reality fully understood minor details needing filled
delusion sheldrake argues turned science series dogmas grounded philosophical materialism rather open-minded approach investigating phenomena
argues there many powerful taboos circumscribe scientists legitimately direct their attention towards

229 suggests dna insufficient explain inheritance inheritance form behaviour mediated through morphic resonance
157–186 also promotes morphic resonance broader fashion explanation other phenomena such memory
187–211 reviews outside scientific community often positive
philosopher mary midgley writing guardian welcomed new mind-body paradigm address unlucky fact our current form mechanistic materialism rests muddled outdated notions matter
she also stated sheldrake's analogy natural regularities habit found writings cs peirce nietzsche william james whitehead
another review deepak chopra commended sheldrake wanting end breach science religion
philosopher martin cohen times higher educational supplement sheldrake pokes enough holes such certainties [of orthodox science] make work valuable contribution philosophical debates also scientific ones too although cohen noted sheldrake goes bit too far here there
mixed review bryan appleyard writing sunday times commented sheldrake most incisive making broad critique contemporary science scientism sheldrake's own scientific theories appleyard noted morphic resonance widely derided narrowly supported
most experimental evidence contested though sheldrake argues there 'statistically significant' results
appleyard certainly highly speculative simply can't tell whether makes sense
other reviews less favourable

november 2013 sheldrake gave lecture oxford union outlining claims made science delusion modern science become constrained dogma
sheldrake argued these dogmatic constraints particularly evident physics

book burning? september 1981 nature published editorial new science life entitled book burning? written journal's senior editor john maddox editorial
sheldrake's book splendid illustration widespread public misconception science
reality sheldrake's argument no sense scientific argument exercise pseudo-science
many readers will left impression sheldrake succeeded finding place magic within scientific discussion indeed may part objective writing such book
maddox argued sheldrake's hypothesis testable falsifiable popper's sense referring work philosopher karl popper
sheldrake's proposals testing hypothesis time-consuming inconclusive sense will possible account another morphogenetic field impractical
editorial maddox ultimately rejected suggestion book should burned
nonetheless title piece garnered widespread publicity
subsequent issue nature published several letters expressing disapproval editorial including physicist
josephson criticised maddox failure admit even possibility genuine physical facts may exist lie outside scope current scientific descriptions
1983 editorial guardian compared petulance wrath scientific establishment aimed against sheldrake galileo affair lysenkoism
responding same paper brian charlesworth defended scientific establishment affirming ultimate test scientific theory conformity observations experiments vitalistic lamarckian ideas [the guardian] seem regard highly repeatedly failed test
letter guardian 1988 scientist glasgow university referred title book burning? posing question attract attention criticised perpetuation myth maddox ever advocated burning sheldrake's book
1999 maddox characterised 1981 editorial injudicious saying even though concluded sheldrake's book

sheldrake steven rose 1987 1988 sheldrake contributed several pieces guardian's body soul column
these idea memories stored our brains theory despite decades research phenomenon memory remains mysterious
provoked response professor steven rose neuroscientist open university criticised sheldrake being researcher trained another discipline botany respect[ing] data collected neuroscientists before begin[ing] offer us alternative explanations accused sheldrake ignoring denying massive evidence arguing neuroscience over past two decades shown memories stored specific changes brain cells
giving example experiments chicks rose asserted egregious errors sheldrake makes bolster case demands new vague all-embracing theory resolve
sheldrake responded rose's article stating there experimental evidence showed memories survive destruction putative memory traces
rose subsequently responded asking sheldrake get facts straight explaining research concluding there no way straightforward impressive body evidence taken imply memories brain still less brain tuning indeterminate undefined resonating extra-corporeal field
next column sheldrake again attacked rose following materialism argued quantum physics overturned materialism suggested memories may turn out depend morphic resonance rather memory traces
philosopher alan malachowski university east anglia responding called sheldrake's latest muddled diatribe defended materialism argued sheldrake dismissed rose's explanation absurd rhetorical comparison asserted quantum physics compatible materialism argued being roughly right great many things given [materialists] confidence far open minded prepared give them credit
subsequently agreed arranged test morphic resonance hypothesis using chicks
sheldrake published paper stating results matched prediction day-old chicks influenced experiences previous batches day-old chicks
point view hypothesis formative causation results experiment encouraging called further research
rose published separately stating morphic resonance hypothesis disconfirmed
also made further criticisms morphic resonance stated experience collaboration convinced me practice sheldrake committed hypothesis very hard envisage circumstances accept disconfirmation
rose requested professor patrick bateson frs analyse data bateson offered opinion sheldrake's interpretation data misleading attributable experimenter effects
sheldrake responded rose's paper describing polemic aggressive tone extravagant rhetoric concluding results experiment disconfirm hypothesis formative causation rose claims

origin philosophy morphic resonance among early influences sheldrake cites structure scientific revolutions thomas kuhn
sheldrake says book led view contemporary scientific understanding life simply paradigm called mechanistic theory life
reading kuhn's work sheldrake says focused mind how scientific paradigms change
although there similarities morphic resonance hinduism's akashic records sheldrake says first conceived idea while cambridge before travel india later developed
attributes origin morphic resonance idea two influences studies holistic tradition biology french philosopher henri bergson's book matter memory
says took bergson's concept memories being materially embedded brain generalised morphic resonance memories immaterial also under influence collective past memories similar organisms
while colleagues cambridge receptive idea sheldrake found opposite true india
recounts indian colleagues saying there's nothing new known millennia ago ancient rishis
sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance convergence western eastern thought having originated west developed east
sheldrake also noted similarities morphic resonance carl jung's collective unconscious regard collective memories being shared across individuals coalescing particular behaviours through repetition described jung archetypes
however whereas jung assumed archetypal forms transmitted through physical inheritance sheldrake attributes collective memories morphic resonance rejects any explanation them involving terms mechanistic biology
