claim great books western world project inherently unnecessary saying understanding shared cultural items within books important reading them

1940 james t
farrell called adler leading american fellow-traveller roman catholic church
true adler farrell postulated dogma roman catholic church sang same tune avowed catholic philosophers like étienne gilson jacques maritain martin d'arcy
farrell attributed adler's delay joining church being among those christians wanted their cake
wanted eat too compared emperor constantine waited until deathbed formally become catholic
adler took long time make up mind theological issues
how think god guide twentieth-century pagan 1980 claimed consider himself pagan book's subtitle
volume 51 mars hill audio journal 2001 ken myers includes 1980 interview adler conducted after how think god published
myers reminisces during interview asked why never embraced christian faith himself
explained while profoundly influenced number christian thinkers during life
there moral intellectual obstacles conversion
didn't explain any further
myers notes adler finally surrendered hound heaven made confession faith baptized episcopalian 1984 few years after interview
offering insight adler's conversion myers quotes subsequent 1990 article christianity magazine my chief reason choosing christianity because mysteries incomprehensible
what's point revelation figure out ourselves? wholly comprehensible then just another philosophy
according friend deal hudson adler attracted catholicism many years wanted roman catholic issues like abortion resistance family friends kept away
many thought baptized episcopalian rather catholic solely because wonderful ardently episcopal wife caroline
hudson suggests no coincidence after her death 1998 took final step
december 1999 san mateo moved spend last years adler formally received catholic church long-time friend admirer bishop pierre du maine
finally another friend ralph mc inerny became roman catholic training life
despite being catholic most life adler considered catholic philosopher account lifelong participation neo-thomist movement almost equally long membership american catholic philosophical association
philosophy adler referred aristotle's nicomachean ethics ethics common sense also moral philosophy sound practical undogmatic
thus ethical doctrine answers questions moral philosophy should attempt answer neither nor less answers true standard truth appropriate applicable normative judgments
contrast believed other theories doctrines try answer questions fewer should their answers mixtures truth error particularly moral philosophy immanuel kant
adler self-proclaimed moderate dualist viewed positions psychophysical dualism materialistic monism opposite sides two extremes
regarding dualism dismissed extreme form dualism stemmed such philosophers plato body soul descartes mind matter well theory extreme monism mind-brain identity theory
after eliminating extremes adler subscribed moderate form dualism
believed brain necessary sufficient condition conceptual thought immaterial intellect also requisite condition difference human animal behavior radical difference kind
adler defended position against many challenges dualistic theories
freedom free will meanings freedom free will under debate debate confused because there no generally accepted definition either freedom free will
adler's “institute philosophical research” spent ten years studying “idea freedom” word used hundreds authors discussed disputed freedom
study published 1958 volume idea freedom sub-titled dialectical examination idea freedom subsequent comments adler's philosophical dictionary
adler's study concluded delineation three kinds freedom circumstantial natural acquired necessary clarity subject
“circumstantial freedom” denotes “freedom coercion restraint
“natural freedom” denotes “freedom free will” “free choice
freedom determine one’s own decisions plans
freedom exists everyone inherently regardless circumstances state mind
“acquired freedom” freedom “to will ought will” thus “to live [one] ought live
freedom inherent must acquired change whereby person gains qualities “good wise virtuous etc
religion adler's interest religion theology increased made references bible need test articles faith compatibility certainties fields natural knowledge such science philosophy
1981 book how think god adler attempts demonstrate god exnihilator creator something nothing
adler stressed even conclusion god's existence cannot proven demonstrated established true beyond reasonable doubt
however recent re-review argument john cramer concluded recent developments cosmology appear converge support adler's argument light such theories multiverse argument no worse wear may indeed now judged somewhat probable originally
adler believed theology religion living things there nothing intrinsically wrong efforts modernize them
must open change growth like everything else
further there no reason surprised discussions such those death god concept drawn nietzsche stir popular excitement recent past again today
according adler great ideas idea god continues evokes greatest concern among widest group men women
however opposed idea converting atheism new form religion theology
