furthermore corruption book's school reflection corruption peruvian society time novel written
vargas llosa frequently uses writing challenge inadequacies society such demoralization oppression those political power towards those challenge power
main themes explored writing individual's struggle freedom within oppressive reality
example two-volume novel conversation cathedral based tyrannical dictatorship peruvian president manuel
protagonist santiago rebels against suffocating dictatorship participating subversive activities leftist political groups

these novels much lighter farcical comic tone characteristics postmodernism

interlacing dialogues literary scholar m
keith booker argues vargas llosa perfects technique interlacing dialogues novel green house
combining two conversations occur different times creates illusion flashback
vargas llosa also sometimes uses technique means shifting location weaving together two concurrent conversations happening different places
technique staple repertoire began using near end first novel time hero
however does use interlacing dialogues same way novels
example green house technique used serious fashion achieve sober tone focus interrelatedness important events separated time space
contrast captain pantoja special service employs strategy comic effects uses simpler spatial shifts
device similar both virginia woolf's mixing different characters' soliloquies gustave flaubert's counterpoint technique blends together conversation other events such speeches
literary influences vargas llosa's first literary influences relatively obscure peruvian writers such martín adán carlos oquendo de amat césar moro

indeed published book-length study work utopía arcaica 1996
rather restrict himself peruvian literature vargas llosa also looked abroad literary inspiration
two french figures existentialist jean-paul sartre novelist gustave flaubert influenced both technique style
sartre's influence most prevalent vargas llosa's extensive use conversation
epigraph time hero first novel also taken directly sartre's work
flaubert's artistic independence—his novels' disregard reality morals—has admired vargas llosa book-length study flaubert's aesthetics perpetual orgy
analysis flaubert vargas llosa questions revolutionary power literature political setting contrast earlier view literature act rebellion thus marking transition vargas llosa's aesthetic beliefs
other critics such sabine köllmann argue belief transforming power literature great continuities characterize fictional non-fictional work link early statement 'literature fire' nobel prize speech 'in praise reading writing'
vargas llosa's favourite novelists arguably most influential writing career american william faulkner
vargas llosa considers faulkner writer perfected methods modern novel
both writers' styles include intricate changes time narration
time hero example aspects vargas llosa's plot main character's development use narrative time influenced favourite faulkner novel light august
addition studies arguedas flaubert vargas llosa written literary criticisms other authors admired such gabriel garcía márquez albert camus ernest hemingway jean-paul sartre
main goals non-fiction works acknowledge influence these authors writing recognize connection himself other writers critic sara castro-klarén argues offers little systematic analysis these authors' literary techniques
perpetual orgy example discusses relationship own aesthetics flaubert's rather focusing flaubert's alone
impact mario vargas llosa considered major latin american writer alongside other authors such octavio paz julio cortázar jorge luis borges gabriel garcía márquez carlos fuentes
