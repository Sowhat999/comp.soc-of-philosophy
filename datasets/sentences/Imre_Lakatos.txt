largely taken up fictional dialogue set mathematics class
students attempting prove formula euler characteristic algebraic topology theorem properties polyhedra namely polyhedra number their vertices minus number their edges plus number their faces 2 v e + f = 2
dialogue meant represent actual series attempted proofs mathematicians historically offered conjecture repeatedly refuted counterexamples
often students paraphrase famous mathematicians such cauchy noted lakatos's extensive footnotes
lakatos termed polyhedral counter examples euler's formula monsters distinguished three ways handling these objects firstly monster-barring means theorem question applied such objects
secondly monster-adjustment whereby making re-appraisal monster made obey proposed theorem
thirdly exception handling further distinct process
interestingly these distinct strategies taken up qualitative physics terminology monsters applied apparent counter-examples techniques monster-barring monster-adjustment recognized approaches refinement analysis physical issue
lakatos tried establish no theorem informal mathematics final perfect
means should think theorem ultimately true no counterexample yet found
once counterexample
entity contradicting/not explained theorem found adjust theorem possibly extending domain validity
continuous way our knowledge accumulates through logic process proofs refutations
axioms given branch mathematics however lakatos claimed proofs those axioms tautological
logically true
lakatos proposed account mathematical knowledge based idea heuristics
proofs refutations concept 'heuristic' well developed although lakatos gave several basic rules finding proofs counterexamples conjectures
thought mathematical 'thought experiments' valid way discover mathematical conjectures proofs sometimes called philosophy 'quasi-empiricism'
however also conceived mathematical community carrying kind dialectic decide mathematical proofs valid
therefore fundamentally disagreed 'formalist' conception proof prevailed frege's russell's logicism defines proof simply terms formal validity
first publication paper british journal philosophy science 1963–4 proofs refutations became highly influential new work philosophy mathematics although few agreed lakatos' strong disapproval formal proof
before death planning return philosophy mathematics apply theory research programmes
lakatos worrall zahar use poincaré 1893 answer major problems perceived critics namely pattern mathematical research depicted proofs refutations does faithfully represent most actual activity contemporary mathematicians
cauchy uniform convergence 1966 text published lakatos 1978 lakatos re-examines history calculus special regard augustin-louis cauchy concept uniform convergence light non-standard analysis
lakatos concerned historians mathematics should judge evolution mathematics terms currently fashionable theories
illustration examines cauchy's proof sum series continuous functions itself continuous
lakatos critical those see cauchy's proof failure make explicit suitable convergence hypothesis merely inadequate approach weierstrassian analysis
lakatos sees such approach failure realize cauchy's concept continuum differed currently dominant views

april 2013 lakatos's second major contribution philosophy science model 'research programme' formulated attempt resolve perceived conflict popper's falsificationism revolutionary structure science described kuhn
popper's standard falsificationism widely taken imply theory should abandoned soon any evidence appears challenge while kuhn's descriptions scientific activity taken imply science most constructive upheld system popular 'normal' theories despite anomalies
lakatos' model research programme aims combine popper's adherence empirical validity kuhn's appreciation conventional consistency
lakatosian research programme based hard core theoretical assumptions cannot abandoned altered without abandoning programme altogether
modest specific theories formulated order explain evidence threatens 'hard core' termed auxiliary hypotheses
auxiliary hypotheses considered expendable adherents research programme—they may altered abandoned empirical discoveries require order 'protect' 'hard core'
whereas popper generally read hostile toward such ad hoc theoretical amendments lakatos argued progressive
productive enhance programme's explanatory and/or predictive power least permissible until better system theories devised research programme replaced entirely
difference progressive degenerative research programme lies lakatos whether recent changes auxiliary hypotheses achieved greater explanatory/predictive power whether made simply out necessity offering response face new troublesome evidence
degenerative research programme indicates new progressive system theories should sought replace currently prevailing until such system theories conceived agreed upon abandonment current further weaken our explanatory power therefore unacceptable lakatos
lakatos's primary example research programme successful time then progressively replaced founded isaac newton three laws motion forming 'hard core'
lakatosian research programme deliberately provides framework within research conducted basis 'first principles' 'hard core' shared those involved research programme accepted purpose research without further proof debate
regard similar kuhn's notion paradigm
lakatos sought replace kuhn's paradigm guided irrational 'psychology discovery' research programme no less coherent consistent yet guided popper's objectively valid logic discovery
lakatos following pierre duhem's idea protect cherished theory part hostile evidence redirecting criticism toward other theories parts thereof
see confirmation holism duhem–quine thesis
aspect falsification acknowledged popper
popper's theory falsificationism proposed scientists put forward theories nature 'shouts no' form inconsistent observation
according popper irrational scientists maintain their theories face nature's rejection kuhn described them doing
lakatos however propose theory nature may shout no rather propose maze theories nature may shout inconsistent
continued adherence programme's 'hard core' augmented adaptable auxiliary hypotheses reflects lakatos's less strict standard falsificationism
lakatos saw himself merely extending popper's ideas changed over time interpreted many conflicting ways
contrasted popper naive falsificationist demanded unconditional rejection any theory face any anomaly interpretation lakatos saw erroneous nevertheless referred often popper1 nuanced conservatively interpreted philosopher popper2 sophisticated methodological falsificationist lakatos claims logical extension correctly interpreted ideas popper1 therefore essentially lakatos himself
therefore very difficult determine ideas arguments concerning research programme should credited whom
while lakatos dubbed theory sophisticated methodological falsificationism methodological strict sense asserting universal methodological rules scientific research must abide
rather methodological theories abandoned according methodical progression worse theories better theories—a stipulation overlooked lakatos terms dogmatic falsificationism
methodological assertions strict sense pertaining methods valid invalid themselves contained within research programmes choose adhere them should judged according whether research programmes adhere them prove progressive degenerative
lakatos divided these 'methodological rules' within research programme 'negative heuristics'
research methods approaches avoid 'positive heuristics'
research methods approaches prefer
lakatos claimed changes auxiliary hypotheses research programme calls 'problem shifts' equally productive acceptable
took view these 'problem shifts' should evaluated just their ability defend 'hard core' explaining apparent anomalies also their ability produce new facts form predictions additional explanations
adjustments accomplish nothing maintenance 'hard core' mark research programme degenerative
lakatos' model provides possibility research programme continued presence troublesome anomalies remains progressive despite them
lakatos essentially necessary continue theory basically know cannot completely true even possible make scientific progress doing long remain receptive better research programme may eventually conceived
sense lakatos acknowledged misnomer refer 'falsification' 'refutation' truth falsity theory solely determining whether consider 'falsified' also availability less false theory
theory cannot rightfully 'falsified' according lakatos until superseded better
progressive research programme
says happening historical periods kuhn describes revolutions makes them rational opposed mere leaps faith periods deranged social psychology kuhn argued
pseudoscience according demarcation criterion pseudoscience originally proposed lakatos theory pseudoscientific fails make any novel predictions previously unknown phenomena contrast scientific theories predict novel facts
progressive scientific theories those their novel facts confirmed degenerate scientific theories those whose predictions novel facts refuted
put given fact explained scientifically new fact predicted

lakatos's own key examples pseudoscience ptolemaic astronomy immanuel velikovsky's planetary cosmogony freudian psychoanalysis 20 th century soviet marxism lysenko's biology niels bohr's quantum mechanics post-1924 astrology psychiatry sociology neoclassical economics darwin's theory
darwin's theory 1973 lse scientific method lecture also claimed nobody date yet found demarcation criterion according darwin described scientific
almost 20 years after lakatos's 1973 challenge scientificity darwin her ant peacock lse lecturer ex-colleague lakatos helena cronin attempted establish darwinian theory empirically scientific respect least being supported evidence likeness diversity life forms world explained descent modification
she our usual idea corroboration requiring successful prediction novel facts
darwinian theory strong temporally novel predictions
however familiar evidence whatever role played construction theory still confirms theory
historiographical research programmes 1970 paper history science rational reconstructions lakatos proposed dialectical historiographical meta-method evaluating different theories scientific method namely means their comparative success explaining actual history science scientific revolutions hand whilst other providing historiographical framework rationally reconstructing history science anything merely inconsequential rambling
paper started now renowned dictum philosophy science without history science empty history science without philosophy science blind
however neither lakatos himself nor collaborators ever completed first part dictum showing any scientific revolution great majority relevant scientific community converted just lakatos's criterion programme successfully predicting novel facts whilst competitor degenerated satisfied
indeed historical case studies 1970 criticism methodology scientific research programmes openly admitted much commenting 'in paper my purpose go seriously second stage comparing rational reconstructions actual history any lack historicity
criticism feyerabend paul feyerabend argued lakatos's methodology methodology merely words sound like elements methodology
argued lakatos's methodology no different practice epistemological anarchism feyerabend's own position
science free society after lakatos's death lakatos realized admitted existing standards rationality standards logic included too restrictive hindered science applied determination
therefore permitted scientist violate them admits science rational sense these standards
however demanded research programmes show certain features long run — must progressive
argued demand no longer restricts scientific practice
any development agrees
