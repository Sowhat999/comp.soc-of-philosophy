epistles rasa'il generally increase abstractness finally dealing brethren's somewhat pantheistic philosophy each soul emanation fragment universal soul will reunite death turn universal soul will reunite allah doomsday
epistles intended transmit right knowledge leading harmony universe happiness
organization further information list rasa'il encyclopedia brethren purity organizationally divided 52 epistles
52 rasa'il subdivided four sections sometimes called books indeed complete editions encyclopedia four volumes order 14 mathematical sciences 17 natural sciences 10 psychological rational sciences theological sciences
division four sections no accident number four held great importance neoplatonic numerology being first square number being even
reputedly pythagoras held man's life divided four sections much like year divided four seasons
brethren divided mathematics itself four sections arithmetic pythagoras nicomachus' domain ptolemy ruled over astronomy almagest geometry associated euclid naturally fourth last division music
fours cease there- brethren observed four crucial decimal system numbers themselves broken down four orders magnitude ones tens hundreds thousands there four winds four directions north south east west medicine concerned itself four humours natural philosophers four elements empedocles
another possibility suggested netton veneration four stems instead brethren's great interest corpus hermeticum hermes trismegistus identified god hermes whom number four sacred hermetic tradition's magical lore main subject 51 st rasa'il
netton mentions there suggestions 52 nd rasa'il talismans magic later addition encyclopedia because intertextual evidence number rasa'ils claim total rasa'ils 51
however 52 nd rasa'il itself claims number 51 area number 52 another leading possibility brethren's attraction number 51 17 times 3 there 17 rasa'ils natural sciences responsible confusion
seyyed hossein nasr suggests origin preference 17 stemmed alchemist jābir ibn hayyān's numerological symbolism
risalat al-jami'a besides fifty-odd epistles there exists claims overarching summary work counted 52 called summary al-risalat al-jami'a exists two versions
summary interestingly enough claimed work majriti
circa 1008 although netton states majriti composed yves marquet concludes philological analysis vocabulary style philosophie des ihwan al-safa 1975 composed same time main corpus
style like conventional arabic islamic works epistles no lack time-worn honorifics quotations qur'an encyclopedia also famous didactic fables sprinkled throughout text particular island animals debate animals embedded within nd rasa'il titled how animals their kinds formed most popular animal fables islam
fable concerns how 70 men nearly shipwrecked discover island animals ruled began settle
oppressed killed animals unused such harsh treatment complained king shah djinns
king arranged series debates humans various representatives animals such nightingale bee jackal
animals nearly defeat humans arabian ends series pointing out there way humans superior animals worthy making animals their servants ones allah offered chance eternal life
king convinced argument granted judgement them strongly cautioned them same qur'an supported them also promised them hellfire should mistreat their animals
philosophy metaphysical four ranks spiritual principles apparently elaboration plotinus' triad thought soul known brethren through theologia aristotle version plotinus' enneads arabic modified changes paraphrases attributed aristotle first creator al-bārī emanated down universal intellect al-'aql al-kullī then universal soul al-nafs through prime matter al-hayūlā al-ūlā emanated still further down through creating mundane hierarchy
mundane hierarchy consisted nature al-tabī'a absolute body al-jism al-mutlaq sphere al-falak four elements al-arkān beings world al-muwalladāt their three varieties animals minerals vegetables total hierarchy nine members
furthermore each member increased subdivisions proportional how far down hierarchy instance sphere being number seven seven planets members
“ absolute body also form prime matter explained chapter matter
prime matter spiritual form emanated universal soul
universal soul also spiritual form emanated universal intellect first thing creator created
pythagorean doctrines followed however
brethren argued strenuously against transmigration soul
since refused accept transmigration then platonic idea learning remembrance man never attain complete knowledge whilst shackled body must false brethren's stance rather person potentially learn everything worth knowing avoid snares delusion sinful world eventually attaining paradise allah salvation unless studied wise men wise books - like their encyclopedia whose sole purpose entice men learn knowledge possibly saved - possibility never become actuality
netton writes magpie eclecticism surveyed utilized elements philosophies pythagoras plato aristotle plotinus religions such nestorian christianity judaism hinduism early attempt ecumenism interfaith dialogue
their accumulation knowledge ordered towards sublime goal salvation
use their own image perceived their brotherhood invited others ship salvation float free sea matter ikhwan their doctrines mutual cooperation asceticism righteous living reach gates paradise care
another area brethren differed their conceptions nature rejected emanation forms characterized platonic philosophy quasi-aristotelian system substances “ know o brother scholars things two types substances accidents substances kind self-existent while accidents nine kinds present substances attributes them
creator may described either accident substance their creator efficient cause
“ first thing creator produced called existence simple spiritual extremely perfect excellent substance form things contained
substance called intellect
substance proceeds second hierarchy below first called universal soul al-nafs al-kullīyah
universal soul proceeds another substance below soul called original matter
latter transformed absolute body secondary matter length width depth

1930 encyclopædia britannica described mingling neoplatonism aristotelianism way “ materials work come chiefly aristotle conceived platonizing spirit places bond things universal soul world partial fragmentary souls
evolution text encyclopedia brethren purity describes biological diversity manner similar modern day theory evolution
contexts such passages interpreted differently scholars
document modern day scholars note “chain being described ikhwan possess temporal aspect led certain scholars view authors rasai’l believed modern theory evolution”
according rasa’il “but individuals perpetual flow neither definite nor preserved
reason conservation forms genus species matter fixity their celestial cause because their efficient cause universal soul spheres instead change continuous flux individuals due variability their cause”
statement supporting concept species individuals static change due new purpose given
ikhwan doctrine there similarities theory evolution
both believe “the time existence terrestrial plants precedes animals minerals precede plants organism adapt their environment” asserts everything exists purpose
muhammad hamidullah describes ideas evolution found encyclopedia brethren purity epistles ikhwan al-safa follows [these books] state god first created matter invested energy development
matter therefore adopted form vapour assumed shape water due time
next stage development mineral life
different kinds stones developed course time
their highest form being mirjan coral
stone branches like those tree
after mineral life evolves vegetation
evolution vegetation culminates tree bears qualities animal
male female genders
does wither branches chopped dies head cut off
date-palm therefore considered highest among trees resembles lowest among animals
then born lowest animals
evolves ape
statement darwin
ibn maskawayh states precisely written epistles ikhwan al-safa
muslim thinkers state ape then evolved lower kind barbarian man
then became superior human being
man becomes saint prophet
evolves higher stage becomes angel
higher angels indeed none god
everything begins everything returns

surprising still denouncement belief concealed imam painful those hold discredit significance 'number seven' those believe contrary ikhwan's creed
compare extract later rasa'il netton provides pg 102 muslim neoplatonists know o brother these qualities united simultaneously human being during cycles astral conjunctions then person delegate al-mab'uth master age sahib al-zaman imam people long lives fulfills mission accomplishes allotted task advises community records revelation codifies interpretation consolidates holy law clarifies method implements traditional procedures welds community does then dies passes away those qualities will remain community heritage
those qualities most them united community then man suited successor community after death
does happen those qualities united man scattered among members speak voice their hearts united love each other cooperate supporting faith preserving law implementing sunna bearing community along path religion then their dynasty will endure world outcome will happy them next
no system satisfied these brethren
too well acquainted other creeds too well trained logical use thought accept common orthodox islam contented desert arabs
yet other creeds systems equally appeared open doubt refutation
confusion found their satisfaction eclectic theory
these conflicting views must different ways looking same thing
