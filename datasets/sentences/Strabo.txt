education strabo studied under several prominent teachers various specialties throughout early life[n 3] different stops along mediterranean travels
first chapter education took place nysa modern sultanhisar turkey under master rhetoric aristodemus formerly taught sons very same roman general taken over pontus
[n 4] aristodemus head two schools rhetoric grammar nysa rhodes former two cities possessing distinct intellectual curiosity homeric literature interpretation epics
strabo admirer homer's poetry perhaps consequence time spent nysa aristodemus
[n 5] around age 21 strabo moved rome studied philosophy peripatetic xenarchus highly respected tutor augustus's court
despite xenarchus's aristotelian leanings strabo later gives evidence formed own stoic inclinations
[n 6] rome also learned grammar under rich famous scholar tyrannion amisus
[n 7] although tyrannion also peripatetic relevantly respected authority geography fact obviously significant considering strabo's future contributions field
final noteworthy mentor strabo athenodorus cananites philosopher spent life since bc rome forging relationships roman elite
athenodorus endowed strabo three important items philosophy knowledge contacts
unlike aristotelian xenarchus tyrannion preceded teaching strabo athenodorus stoic mindset almost certainly source strabo's diversion philosophy former mentors
moreover own first-hand experience athenodorus provided strabo information regions empire otherwise known
geographica main article geographica map world according strabo
strabo most notable work geographica geography presented descriptive history people places different regions world known era
map europe according strabo
although geographica rarely utilized contemporary antiquity multitude copies survived throughout byzantine empire
first appeared western europe rome latin translation issued around 1469
first greek edition published 1516 venice
isaac casaubon classical scholar editor greek texts provided first critical edition 1587
although strabo cited antique greek astronomers eratosthenes hipparchus acknowledging their astronomical mathematical efforts towards geography claimed descriptive approach practical such works designed statesmen anthropologically numerically concerned character countries regions
such geographica provides valuable source information ancient world especially information corroborated other sources
strabo pro-roman politically culturally reserves primacy greece
pro-roman throughout geography
while acknowledges even praises roman ascendancy political military sphere also makes significant effort establish greek primacy over rome other contexts

treating conjecture merited disregard strabo passes hypothesis strato natural philosopher observed quantity mud brought down rivers euxine great bed must gradually raised while rivers still continued pour undiminished quantity water
therefore conceived originally euxine inland sea level means become much elevated burst barrier near byzantium formed communication propontis partial drainage already supposed converted left side marshy ground last whole choked up soil
argued mediterranean once opened passage itself columns hercules atlantic perhaps abundance sea-shells africa near temple jupiter ammon might also deposit former inland sea length forced passage escaped
strabo rejects theory insufficient account phenomena proposes own profoundness modern geologists beginning appreciate
'it not' says 'because lands covered seas originally different altitudes waters risen subsided receded parts inundated others
reason same land sometimes raised up sometimes depressed sea also simultaneously raised depressed either overflows returns own place again
must therefore ascribe cause ground either ground under sea becomes flooded rather lies beneath sea moveable account humidity altered great celerity
proper' observes continuation 'to derive our explanations things obvious measure daily occurrence such deluges earthquakes volcanic eruptions sudden swellings land beneath sea last raise up sea also same lands subside again occasion sea let down
merely small large islands also merely islands continents lifted up together sea both large small tracts may subside habitations cities like bure bizona many others engulfed earthquakes

…there no trees here vineyards produce katakekaumene wines no means inferior any wines famous their quality
soil covered ashes black color mountainous rocky country made up fires
assume these ashes result thunderbolts sub‐ terranean explosions doubt legendary story typhon takes place region
ksanthos adds king region man called arimus
however reasonable accept whole country burned down time result such event rather result fire bursting underground whose source now died out
three pits called “physas” separated forty stadia each other
above these pits there hills formed hot masses burst out ground estimated logical reasoning
such type soil very convenient viniculture just like katanasoil covered ashes best wines still produced abundantly
