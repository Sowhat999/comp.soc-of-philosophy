hyman curious why people believe paranormal claims without evidence continue 'i just want understand how people get believe things
magic perfect example how people fooled' works same way paranormal claims
hyman felt necessary teach attendees case-based approach
concrete examples first step toward extracting broad examples
giving benefit context learning experience

helped lay groundwork shift behavioral psychology
era cognitive psychology
hyman's second published paper submitted while still grad student

then asked parapsychologists best evidence psi? nearly universally pointed ganzfeld experiment
hyman charles honorton sent 600 pages information
three years later hyman's analysis led 1985 issue journal parapsychology publishing hyman's critiques
hyman's conclusion themselves these experiments mean anything unless replicated
ray hyman paul kurtz james randi ken frazier tam8 july 2010 las vegas
after their session history modern skeptical movement
uri geller stanford research institute magician jerry andrus hyman appeared 1975 tv station portland oregon explained duplicated paranormal tricks geller performed host dick klinger week prior
klinger asked does uri geller any supernatural powers? andrus gave short answer no
hyman stated geller opportunist
why difficult duplicate himself cannot duplicate himself
he's ready something
going something you think doing something else
he's excellent he's superb
1972 hyman asked department defense investigate psychic uri geller
hyman intrigued story geller taken ring scientists set table without touching ring stood end broke half formed itself s-shape
upon questioning scientists lab hyman discovered no actually seen happen heard stories others tracked down happened
hyman continued question scientists discovered no ever seen geller bend anything without touching
fact geller allowed take object bathroom
then come back bent object took word
parapsychologist also sent investigate 'saw psychic' reported back saw charismatic fraud
asked explain further why people believe geller magician same thing without paranormal powers hyman states he's fraud you can't blame people believing
geller product wonderful public relations campaign
audience gets side story
caught cheating many times people still believe
speaking psychologist hyman says you get people right frame mind cooperating you
even give them poor reading
will fit themselves believe you telling them their unique personality
gary schwartz professor gary schwartz conducted numerous experiments laboratory university arizona tenured
schwartz believes proven dead communicate living through human mediums
hyman details many methodological errors schwartz's research including inappropriate control comparisons failure use double-blind procedures creating non-falsifiable outcomes reinterpreting failures successes failure independently check facts sitters endorsed true
hyman even research program compromised these defects claims being made require replication independent investigators
hyman criticizes schwartz's decision publish results without gathering evidence their hypothesis meet generally accepted scientific criteria
lost credibility
there many follow-up exchanges schwartz hyman over afterlife experiments conducted schwartz
published may 2003 schwartz responded hyman ignored total body research
schwartz takes issue hyman's opinion hyman will believe psi
hyman answered until multiple perfect experiments performed published
believe totality findings must due combination fraud cold reading rater bias experimenter error chance
why spend time money conducting multiple multi-center double-blind experiments unless there sufficient theoretical experimental social reasons doing so? quotes never never met proponent paranormal didn't preface their introduction me 'i'm skeptic too'
scientists outstanding minds people first-class scientists
same time peddling sort horrible paranormal nonsense
think going here emphasize individual make hero out individual scientist
forget attribute their success fact part discipline peer review checks balances
attribute something inside themselves
means feel walk outside their discipline
whatever want will still good science because good scientists
does work well
micro-biologist walk observatory good astronomy
psychologist know normal skeptic 'we mutants'
normal believer
james underdown explains hyman's maxim don't try explain how something works until you find out works
hyman's maxim named james alcock
skeptics keep building centers over world
very expensive
doing fundraisers
skeptic movement focuses fighting amongst themselves
done nothing towards outreach most
give people tools think help them become better thinkers
concerning science replication that's how you know something's 'there'
parapsychology doesn't 'there' replicate
respond 'that nature psi
just you're closing takes off different direction
then throw quantum mechanics
don't sex appeal geller that's why i'm making my money college professor
also can't lie conveniently
garbage garbage out speaking graduates simon fraser university you going any chance solve any problem first make sure your facts correct
parapsychology essentially scientific enterprise
practitioners serious scientific researchers often ph level
problem most
after dust settles argument still hope 'something there
skeptic's position
anti-psi agnostic
skeptic's 'belief' claim normal explanation

sophomore college friend suggested try read my next client's palm telling her opposite lines
her heart line indicated she like display her emotions tell her she sort person displays her emotions openly
her head line she practical person tell her she imaginative somewhat impractical
my astonishment client thrilled how accurately captured her personality
tried same experiment my next few clients
results same! now coming realization whatever happening palm reading session nothing lines hand
majoring journalism came realization
