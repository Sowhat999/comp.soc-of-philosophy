work general nature religion work history religion eliade most highly regarded writings alchemy shamanism yoga called eternal return—the implicit belief supposedly present religious thought general religious behavior imitation also participation sacred events thus restores mythical time origins
eliade's thinking part influenced rudolf otto gerardus van leeuw nae ionescu writings traditionalist school rené guénon julius evola
instance eliade's sacred profane partially builds otto's idea holy show how religion emerges experience sacred myths time nature
eliade known attempt find broad cross-cultural parallels unities religion particularly myths
wendy doniger eliade's colleague 1978 until death observed eliade argued boldly universals might safely argued widely prevalent patterns
treatise history religions praised french philologist georges dumézil coherence ability synthesize diverse distinct mythologies
robert ellwood describes eliade's approach religion follows
eliade approaches religion imagining ideally religious person whom calls homo religiosus writings
eliade's theories basically describe how homo religiosus view world
does mean religious practitioners actually think act like homo religiosus
instead means religious behavior says through own language world homo religiosus see whether real-life participants religious behavior aware
however ellwood writes eliade tends slide over last qualification implying traditional societies actually thought like homo religiosus
sacred profane moses taking off shoes front burning bush illustration 16 th-century edition speculum humanae salvationis
eliade argues religious thought general rests sharp distinction sacred profane whether takes form god gods mythical ancestors sacred contains reality value other things acquire reality extent participate sacred
eliade's understanding religion centers concept hierophany manifestation sacred—a concept includes limited older restrictive concept theophany manifestation god
perspective religious thought eliade argues hierophanies give structure orientation world establishing sacred order
profane space nonreligious experience divided up geometrically no qualitative differentiation hence no orientation [is] given virtue inherent structure
thus profane space gives man no pattern behavior
contrast profane space site hierophany sacred structure religious man conforms himself
hierophany amounts revelation absolute reality opposed non-reality vast surrounding expanse
example sacred space demanding certain response man eliade gives story moses halting before yahweh's manifestation burning bush exodus 35 taking off shoes
origin myths sacred time eliade notes traditional societies myth represents absolute truth primordial time
according myths time sacred first appeared establishing world's structure—myths claim describe primordial events made society natural world
eliade argues myths sense origin myths myth then account creation
many traditional societies believe power thing lies origin
origin equivalent power then first manifestation thing significant valid thing's reality value therefore lies first appearance
according eliade's theory sacred value thing's first appearance value therefore sacred's first appearance value
myth describes sacred's first appearance therefore mythical age sacred time time value primitive man interested beginnings [
mattered little happened himself others like less distant times
eliade postulated reason nostalgia origins appears many religions desire return primordial paradise
eternal return terror history main article eternal return eliade eliade argues traditional man attributes no value linear march historical events events mythical age value
give own life value traditional man performs myths rituals
because sacred's essence lies mythical age sacred's first appearance any later appearance actually first appearance recounting re-enacting mythical events myths rituals re-actualize those events
eliade often uses term archetypes refer mythical models established sacred although eliade's use term should distinguished use term jungian psychology
thus argues eliade religious behavior does commemorate also participates sacred events imitating exemplary acts god mythical hero simply recounting their adventures man archaic society detaches himself profane time magically re-enters great time sacred time
eliade called concept eternal return distinguished philosophical concept eternal return
wendy doniger noted eliade's theory eternal return become truism study religions
eliade attributes well-known cyclic vision time ancient thought belief eternal return
instance new year ceremonies among mesopotamians egyptians other near eastern peoples re-enacted their cosmogonic myths
therefore logic eternal return each new year ceremony beginning world these peoples
according eliade these peoples felt need return beginning regular intervals turning time circle
eliade argues yearning remain mythical age causes terror history traditional man desires escape linear succession events eliade indicated viewed empty any inherent value sacrality
eliade suggests abandonment mythical thought full acceptance linear historical time terror reasons modern man's anxieties
traditional societies escape anxiety extent refuse completely acknowledge historical time
coincidentia oppositorum eliade claims many myths rituals mystical experiences involve coincidence opposites coincidentia oppositorum
fact calls coincidentia oppositorum mythical pattern
many myths eliade notes present us twofold revelation express hand diametrical opposition two divine figures sprung same principle destined many versions reconciled illud tempus eschatology other coincidentia oppositorum very nature divinity shows itself turns even simultaneously benevolent terrible creative destructive solar serpentine other words actual potential
eliade argues yahweh both kind wrathful god christian mystics theologians terrible gentle once
also thought indian chinese mystic tried attain state perfect indifference neutrality resulted coincidence opposites pleasure pain desire repulsion cold heat [
expunged awareness
according eliade coincidentia oppositorum’s appeal lies man's deep dissatisfaction actual situation called human condition
many mythologies end mythical age involves fall fundamental ontological change structure world
because coincidentia oppositorum contradiction represents denial world's current logical structure reversal fall
also traditional man's dissatisfaction post-mythical age expresses itself feeling being torn separate
many mythologies lost mythical age paradise paradoxical state contraries exist side side without conflict multiplications form aspects mysterious unity
coincidentia oppositorum expresses wish recover lost unity mythical paradise presents reconciliation opposites unification diversity level pre-systematic thought mystery totality embodies man's endeavor reach perspective contraries abolished spirit evil reveals itself stimulant good demons appear night aspect gods
exceptions general nature last judgment detail 12 th century byzantine mosaic torcello
eliade acknowledges religious behavior attributes described theory sacred time eternal return
zoroastrian jewish christian muslim traditions embrace linear historical time sacred capable sanctification while eastern traditions largely reject notion sacred time seeking escape cycles time
because contain rituals judaism christianity necessarily—eliade argues—retain sense cyclic time very fact religion christianity keep least mythical aspect—liturgical time periodic rediscovery illud tempus beginnings [and] imitation christ exemplary pattern
however judaism christianity see time circle endlessly turning itself nor see such cycle desirable way participate sacred
instead these religions embrace concept linear history progressing toward messianic age last judgment thus initiating idea progress humans work paradise future
however eliade's understanding judaeo-christian eschatology also understood cyclical end time return god final catastrophe will put end history hence will restore man eternity beatitude
pre-islamic persian religion zoroastrianism made notable contribution religious formation west also linear sense time
according eliade hebrews linear sense time before being influenced zoroastrianism
fact eliade identifies hebrews zoroastrians first culture truly valorize historical time first see major historical events episodes continuous divine revelation
however eliade argues judaism elaborated mythology linear time adding elements borrowed zoroastrianism—including ethical dualism savior figure future resurrection body idea cosmic progress toward final triumph good
indian religions east generally retain cyclic view time—for instance hindu doctrine kalpas
according eliade most religions accept cyclic view time also embrace see way return sacred time
however buddhism jainism forms hinduism sacred lies outside flux material world called maya illusion reach escaping cycles time
because sacred lies outside cyclic time conditions humans people reach sacred escaping human condition
according eliade yoga techniques aim escaping limitations body allowing soul atman rise above maya reach sacred nirvana moksha
imagery freedom death one's old body rebirth new body occur frequently yogic texts representing escape bondage temporal human condition
eliade discusses these themes detail yoga immortality freedom
symbolism center main article axis mundi cosmic tree yggdrasill depicted 17 th-century icelandic miniature
recurrent theme eliade's myth analysis axis mundi center world
according eliade cosmic center necessary corollary division reality sacred profane
sacred contains value world gains purpose meaning through hierophanies homogeneous infinite expanse no point reference possible hence no orientation established hierophany reveals absolute fixed point center
because profane space gives man no orientation life sacred must manifest itself hierophany thereby establishing sacred site around man orient himself
site hierophany establishes fixed point center
center abolishes homogeneity relativity profane space becomes central axis future orientation
manifestation sacred profane space definition example something breaking through plane existence another
therefore initial hierophany establishes center must point there contact different planes—this eliade argues explains frequent mythical imagery cosmic tree pillar joining heaven earth underworld
eliade noted traditional societies found new territory often perform consecrating rituals reenact hierophany established center founded world
addition designs traditional buildings especially temples usually imitate mythical image axis mundi joining different cosmic levels
instance babylonian ziggurats built resemble cosmic mountains passing through heavenly spheres rock temple jerusalem supposed reach deep tehom primordial waters
according logic eternal return site each such symbolic center will actually center world may general majority sacred ritual trees meet history religions replicas imperfect copies exemplary archetype cosmic tree
thus these sacred trees thought situated centre world ritual trees posts [
magically projected centre world
according eliade's interpretation religious man apparently feels need live near mythical center much possible given center point communication sacred
thus eliade argues many traditional societies share common outlines their mythical geographies
middle known world sacred center place sacred above center anchors established order
around sacred center lies known world realm established order beyond known world chaotic dangerous realm peopled ghosts demons [and] 'foreigners' [identified with] demons souls dead
according eliade traditional societies place their known world center because their perspective their known world realm obeys recognizable order therefore must realm sacred manifests itself regions beyond known world seem strange foreign must lie far center outside order established sacred
high god see also sky father deus otiosus according evolutionistic theories religion especially edward burnett tylor cultures naturally progress animism polytheism monotheism
according view advanced cultures should monotheistic primitive cultures should polytheistic
however many most primitive pre-agricultural societies believe supreme sky-god
thus according eliade post-19 th-century scholars rejected tylor's theory evolution animism
based discovery supreme sky-gods among primitives eliade suspects earliest humans worshiped heavenly supreme being
patterns comparative religion writes most popular prayer world addressed 'our father art heaven
possible man's earliest prayers addressed same heavenly father
however eliade disagrees wilhelm schmidt thought earliest form religion strict monotheism
eliade dismisses theory primordial monotheism urmonotheismus rigid unworkable
most writes schema [schmidt's theory] renders account human [religious] evolution since paleolithic era
urmonotheismus exist eliade adds probably differed many ways conceptions god many modern monotheistic faiths instance primordial high god manifest himself animal without losing status celestial supreme being
according eliade heavenly supreme beings actually less common advanced cultures
eliade speculates discovery agriculture brought host fertility gods goddesses forefront causing celestial supreme being fade away eventually vanish many ancient religions
even primitive hunter-gatherer societies high god vague distant figure dwelling high above world
often no cult receives prayer last resort else failed
eliade calls distant high god deus otiosus idle god
belief systems involve deus otiosus distant high god believed closer humans during mythical age
after finishing works creation high god forsook earth withdrew highest heaven
example sacred's distance profane life life lived after mythical age escaping profane condition through religious behavior figures such shaman return conditions mythical age include nearness high god flight ascension shaman [
meets god heaven face face speaks directly man sometimes illo tempore
shamanistic behaviors surrounding high god particularly clear example eternal return
shamanism overview shaman performing ceremonial tuva
eliade's scholarly work includes study shamanism shamanism archaic techniques ecstasy survey shamanistic practices different areas
myths dreams mysteries also addresses shamanism detail
shamanism eliade argues restrictive use word shaman should apply just any magician medicine man make term redundant same time argues against restricting term practitioners sacred siberia central asia titles function namely šamán considered eliade tungusic origin term itself introduced western languages
eliade defines shaman follows believed cure like doctors perform miracles fakir type like magicians [
beyond psychopomp may also priest mystic poet
define shamanism way eliade claims find term covers collection phenomena share common unique structure history
thus defined shamanism tends occur purest forms hunting pastoral societies like those siberia central asia revere celestial high god way becoming deus otiosus
eliade takes shamanism those regions most representative example
examinations shamanism eliade emphasizes shaman's attribute regaining man's condition before fall out sacred time most representative mystical experience archaic societies shamanism betrays nostalgia paradise desire recover state freedom beatitude before 'the fall'
concern—which itself concern almost religious behavior according eliade—manifests itself specific ways shamanism
death resurrection secondary functions according eliade most common shamanistic themes shaman's supposed death resurrection
occurs particular during initiation
often procedure supposed performed spirits dismember shaman strip flesh bones then put back together revive
way death resurrection represents shaman's elevation above human nature
first shaman dies rise above human nature quite literal level
after dismembered initiatory spirits often replace old organs new magical ones shaman dies profane self rise again new sanctified being
second being reduced bones shaman experiences rebirth symbolic level many hunting herding societies bone represents source life reduction skeleton equivalent re-entering womb primordial life complete renewal mystical rebirth
eliade considers return source life essentially equivalent eternal return
third shamanistic phenomenon repeated death resurrection also represents transfiguration other ways
shaman dies once many times having died during initiation risen again new powers shaman send spirit out body errands thus whole career consists repeated deaths resurrections
shaman's new ability die return life shows no longer bound laws profane time particularly law death ability 'die' come life again [
denotes [the shaman] surpassed human condition
having risen above human condition shaman bound flow history
therefore enjoys conditions mythical age
many myths humans speak animals after their initiations many shamans claim able communicate animals
according eliade manifestation shaman's return illud tempus described us paradisiac myths
shaman descend underworld ascend heaven often climbing world tree cosmic pillar sacred ladder other form axis mundi
often shaman will ascend heaven speak high god
because gods particularly high god according eliade's deus otiosus concept closer humans during mythical age shaman's easy communication high god represents abolition history return mythical age
because ability communicate gods descend land dead shaman frequently functions psychopomp medicine man

eliade's noted contributions respect 1932 soliloquii soliloquies explored existential philosophy
george călinescu saw echo nae ionescu's lectures traced parallel essays another ionescu's disciples emil cioran while noting cioran's exulted tone written aphoristic form kierkegaard
călinescu recorded eliade's rejection objectivity citing author's stated indifference towards any naïveté contradictions reader possibly reproach well dismissive thoughts theoretical data mainstream philosophy general eliade saw latter inert infertile pathogenic
eliade thus argued sincere brain unassailable denies itself any relationship outside truths
young writer however careful clarify existence took consideration life instincts personal idiosyncrasies believed determined lives many humans distinct set comprising personalities
described personalities characterized both purpose much complicated dangerous alchemy
differentiation george călinescu believed echoed ionescu's metaphor man seen animal fail living duck shall remain duck no matter does
according eliade purpose personalities infinity consciously gloriously bringing [existence] waste many skies possible continuously fulfilling polishing oneself seeking ascent circumference
eliade's view two roads await man process
glory determined either work procreation other asceticism religion magic—both călinescu believed aimed reaching absolute even those cases eliade described latter abyssal experience man may take plunge
critic pointed out addition magical solution options taken consideration seemed eliade's own original contributions mentor's philosophy proposed may owed inspiration julius evola disciples
also recorded eliade applied concept human creation specifically artistic creation citing describing latter magical joy victorious break iron circle reflection imitatio dei having salvation ultimate goal
philosopher religion anti-reductionism transconscious profession eliade historian religion
however scholarly works draw heavily philosophical psychological terminology
addition contain number philosophical arguments religion
particular eliade often implies existence universal psychological spiritual essence behind religious phenomena
because these arguments accused eliade over-generalization essentialism even promoting theological agenda under guise historical scholarship
however others argue eliade better understood scholar willing openly discuss sacred experience consequences
studying religion eliade rejects certain reductionist approaches
eliade thinks religious phenomenon cannot reduced product culture history
insists although religion involves social man economic man forth nonetheless these conditioning factors together themselves add up life spirit
using anti-reductionist position eliade argues against those accuse overgeneralizing looking universals expense particulars
eliade admits every religious phenomenon shaped particular culture history produced son god incarnated became christ speak aramaic conduct himself hebrew times [
religious message however universal might conditioned past present history hebrew people
son god born india spoken language conform itself structure indian languages
however eliade argues against those calls historicist existentialist philosophers recognize man general behind particular men produced particular situations eliade cites immanuel kant likely forerunner kind historicism
adds human consciousness transcends reducible historical cultural conditioning even suggests possibility transconscious
eliade does necessarily mean anything supernatural mystical within transconscious places religious motifs symbols images nostalgias supposedly universal whose causes therefore cannot reduced historical cultural conditioning
platonism primitive ontology according eliade traditional man feels things acquire their reality their identity extent their participation transcendent reality
traditional man profane world meaningless thing rises out profane world conforming ideal mythical model
eliade describes view reality fundamental part primitive ontology study existence reality
here sees similarity philosophy plato believed physical phenomena pale transient imitations eternal models forms see theory forms
argued plato regarded outstanding philosopher 'primitive mentality' thinker succeeded giving philosophic currency validity modes life behavior archaic humanity
eliade thinks platonic theory forms primitive ontology persisting greek philosophy
claims platonism most fully elaborated version primitive ontology
structure religious knowing encountering sacred eliade lonergan john daniel dadosky argues making statement eliade acknowledging indebtedness greek philosophy general plato's theory forms specifically own theory archetypes repetition
however dadosky also states should cautious trying assess eliade's indebtedness plato
dadosky quotes robert segal professor religion draws distinction platonism eliade's primitive ontology eliade ideal models patterns person object may may imitate plato there form everything everything imitates form very fact exists
existentialism secularism behind diverse cultural forms different religions eliade proposes universal traditional man claims believes there absolute reality sacred transcends world manifests itself world thereby sanctifying making real
furthermore traditional man's behavior gains purpose meaning through sacred imitating divine behavior man puts keeps himself close gods—that real significant
according eliade modern nonreligious man assumes new existential situation
traditional man historical events gain significance imitating sacred transcendent events
contrast nonreligious man lacks sacred models how history human behavior should must decide own how history should proceed—he regards himself solely subject agent history refuses appeal transcendence
standpoint religious thought world objective purpose established mythical events man should conform himself myth teaches [religious man] primordial 'stories' constituted existentially
standpoint secular thought any purpose must invented imposed world man
because new existential situation eliade argues sacred becomes primary obstacle nonreligious man's freedom
viewing himself proper maker history nonreligious man resists notions externally instance divinely imposed order model must obey modern man makes himself makes himself completely proportion desacralizes himself world
will truly free until killed last god
religious survivals secular world eliade says secular man cannot escape bondage religious thought
very nature secularism depends religion sense identity resisting sacred models insisting man make history own secular man identifies himself through opposition religious thought [secular man] recognizes himself proportion 'frees' 'purifies' himself 'superstitions' ancestors
furthermore modern man still retains large stock camouflaged myths degenerated rituals
example modern social events still similarities traditional initiation rituals modern novels feature mythical motifs themes
finally secular man still participates something like eternal return reading modern literature modern man succeeds obtaining 'escape time' comparable 'emergence time' effected myths
eliade sees traces religious thought even secular academia
thinks modern scientists motivated religious desire return sacred time origins say anxious search origins life mind fascination 'mysteries nature' urge penetrate decipher inner structure matter—all these longings drives denote sort nostalgia primordial original universal matrix
matter substance represents absolute origin beginning things
eliade believes rise materialism 19 th century forced religious nostalgia origins express itself science
mentions own field history religions fields obsessed origins during 19 th century new discipline history religions developed rapidly cultural context
course followed like pattern positivistic approach facts search origins very beginning religion
western historiography during time obsessed quest origins
search origins human institutions cultural creations prolongs completes naturalist's quest origin species biologist's dream grasping origin life geologist's astronomer's endeavor understand origin earth universe
psychological point view decipher here same nostalgia 'primordial' 'original'
writings eliade describes modern political ideologies secularized mythology
according eliade marxism takes up carries great eschatological myths middle eastern mediterranean world namely redemptive part played just 'elect' 'anointed' 'innocent' 'missioners' our own days proletariat whose sufferings invoked change ontological status world
eliade sees widespread myth golden age according number traditions lies beginning end history precedent karl marx's vision classless society
finally sees marx's belief final triumph good proletariat over evil bourgeoisie truly messianic judaeo-christian ideology
despite marx's hostility toward religion eliade implies ideology works within conceptual framework inherited religious mythology
likewise eliade notes nazism involved pseudo-pagan mysticism based ancient germanic religion
suggests differences nazis' pseudo-germanic mythology marx's pseudo-judaeo-christian mythology explain their differing success comparison vigorous optimism communist myth mythology propagated national socialists seems particularly inept because limitations racial myth how imagine rest europe voluntarily accept submission master-race? above because fundamental pessimism germanic mythology
eschaton prophesied expected ancient germans ragnarok--that catastrophic end world
modern man terror history according eliade modern man displays traces mythological behavior because intensely needs sacred time eternal return
despite modern man's claims nonreligious ultimately cannot find value linear progression historical events even modern man feels terror history here too [
there struggle against time hope freed weight 'dead time' time crushes kills
according eliade terror history becomes especially acute violent threatening historical events confront modern man—the mere fact terrible event happened part history little comfort those suffer
eliade asks rhetorically how modern man tolerate catastrophes horrors history—from collective deportations massacres atomic bombings—if beyond them glimpse no sign no transhistorical meaning
eliade indicates repetitions mythical events provided sacred value meaning history eyes ancient man modern man denied sacred must therefore invent value purpose own
without sacred confer absolute objective value upon historical events modern man left relativistic nihilistic view history resulting spiritual aridity
chapter 4 terror history myth eternal return chapter 9 religious symbolism modern man's anxiety myths dreams mysteries eliade argues length rejection religious thought primary cause modern man's anxieties
inter-cultural dialogue new humanism eliade argues modern man may escape terror history learning traditional cultures
example eliade thinks hinduism advice modern westerners
according many branches hinduism world historical time illusory absolute reality immortal soul atman within man
according eliade hindus thus escape terror history refusing see historical time true reality
eliade notes western continental philosopher might feel suspicious toward hindu view history easily guess european historical existentialist philosopher might reply [
you ask me say 'die history' man cannot anything else history very essence temporality
you asking me then give up my authentic existence take refuge abstraction pure being atman am sacrifice my dignity creator history order live a-historic inauthentic existence empty human content
well prefer put up my anxiety least cannot deprive me certain heroic grandeur becoming conscious accepting human condition
however eliade argues hindu approach history does necessarily lead rejection history
contrary hinduism historical human existence absurdity many continental philosophers see
according hinduism history divine creation may live contentedly within long maintains certain degree detachment devoured time history because lives them because thinks them real consequence forgets undervalues eternity
furthermore eliade argues westerners learn non-western cultures see something besides absurdity suffering death
traditional cultures see suffering death rite passage
fact their initiation rituals often involve symbolic death resurrection symbolic ordeals followed relief
thus eliade argues modern man learn see historical ordeals even death necessary initiations next stage one's existence
eliade even suggests traditional thought offers relief vague anxiety caused our obscure presentiment end world exactly end our world our own civilization
many traditional cultures myths end their world civilization however these myths succeed paralysing either life culture
these traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time therefore inevitable rise new world civilization ruins old
thus feel comforted even contemplating end times
eliade argues western spiritual rebirth happen within framework western spiritual traditions
however says start rebirth westerners may need stimulated ideas non-western cultures
myths dreams mysteries eliade claims genuine encounter cultures might well constitute point departure new humanism upon world scale
christianity salvation history mircea eliade sees abrahamic religions turning point ancient cyclic view time modern linear view time noting their case sacred events limited far-off primordial age continue throughout history time no longer [only] circular time eternal return become linear irreversible time
thus sees christianity ultimate example religion embracing linear historical time
god born man stream history history becomes theophany
according eliade christianity strives save history
christianity sacred enters human being christ save humans also enters history save history turn otherwise ordinary historical events something capable transmitting trans-historical message
eliade's perspective christianity's trans-historical message may most important help modern man confronting terror history
book mito myth italian researcher furio jesi argues eliade denies man position true protagonist history eliade true human experience lies intellectually making history man's experiences joy grief
thus eliade's perspective christ story becomes perfect myth modern man
christianity god willingly entered historical time being born christ accepted suffering followed
identifying christ modern man learn confront painful historical events
ultimately according jesi eliade sees christianity religion save man terror history
eliade's view traditional man sees time endless repetition mythical archetypes
contrast modern man abandoned mythical archetypes entered linear historical time—in context unlike many other religions christianity attributes value historical time
thus eliade concludes christianity incontestably proves religion 'fallen man' modern man lost paradise archetypes repetition
modern gnosticism romanticism eliade's nostalgia analyzing similarities mythologists eliade joseph campbell carl jung robert ellwood concluded three modern mythologists whom believed myths reveal timeless truth fulfilled role gnostics antiquity
diverse religious movements covered term gnosticism share basic doctrines surrounding world fundamentally evil inhospitable trapped world through no fault our own saved world through secret knowledge gnosis
ellwood claimed three mythologists modern gnostics through through remarking whether augustan rome modern europe democracy too easily gave way totalitarianism technology readily used battle comfort immense wealth lay alongside abysmal poverty
gnostics past present sought answers course outward human events knowledge world's beginning lies above beyond world secret places human soul
mythologists spoke acquired large loyal followings
according ellwood mythologists believed gnosticism's basic doctrines even secularized form
ellwood also believes romanticism stimulated modern study mythology strongly influenced mythologists
because romantics stress emotion imagination same dignity reason ellwood argues tend think political truth known less rational considerations capacity fire passions therefore political truth very apt found [
distant past
modern gnostics ellwood argues three mythologists felt alienated surrounding modern world
scholars knew primordial societies operated differently modern ones
people influenced romanticism saw myths saving gnosis offered avenues eternal return simpler primordial ages values rule world forged
addition ellwood identifies eliade's personal sense nostalgia source interest even theories traditional societies
cites eliade himself claiming desire eternal return like traditional man returns mythical paradise my essential preoccupation precisely means escaping history saving myself through symbol myth rite archetypes
ellwood's view eliade's nostalgia enhanced exile romania later years eliade felt own romanian past primal folk mythic time
drawn back yet knew live there well
suggests nostalgia along eliade's sense exile among profoundest metaphors human life influenced eliade's theories
ellwood sees evidence eliade's concept terror history modern man no longer shielded
concept ellwood sees element nostalgia earlier times sacred strong terror history barely raised head
criticism eliade's scholarship overgeneralization eliade cites wide variety myths rituals support theories
however accused making over-generalizations many scholars think lacks sufficient evidence put forth ideas universal even general principles religious thought
according scholar eliade may most popular influential contemporary historian religion many most specialists anthropology sociology even history religions either ignored quickly dismissed eliade's works
classicist g
kirk criticizes eliade's insistence australian aborigines ancient mesopotamians concepts being non-being real becoming although lacked words them
kirk also believes eliade overextends theories example eliade claims modern myth noble savage results religious tendency idealize primordial mythical age
according kirk such extravagances together marked repetitiousness made eliade unpopular many anthropologists sociologists
kirk's view eliade derived theory eternal return functions australian aboriginal mythology then proceeded apply theory other mythologies apply
example kirk argues eternal return does accurately describe functions native american greek mythology
kirk concludes eliade's idea valuable perception certain myths guide proper understanding them
even wendy doniger eliade's successor university chicago claims introduction eliade's own shamanism eternal return does apply myths rituals although may apply many them
however although doniger agrees eliade made over-generalizations she notes willingness argue boldly universals allowed see patterns spanned entire globe whole human history
whether true she argues eliade's theories still useful starting points comparative study religion
she also argues eliade's theories able accommodate new data eliade access
lack empirical support several researchers criticized eliade's work having no empirical support
thus failed provide adequate methodology history religions establish discipline empirical science though same critics admit history religions should aim being empirical science anyway
specifically claim sacred structure human consciousness distrusted being empirically provable no yet turned up basic category sacred
also there mention tendency ignore social aspects religion
anthropologist alice kehoe highly critical eliade's work shamanism namely because anthropologist historian
she contends eliade never any field work contacted any indigenous groups practiced shamanism work synthesized various sources without being supported direct field research
contrast professor kees w
bolle university california los angeles argues professor eliade's approach works empirical bolle sets eliade apart sees eliade's particularly close attention various particular motifs different myths
french researcher daniel dubuisson places doubt eliade's scholarship scientific character citing romanian academic's alleged refusal accept treatment religions their historical cultural context proposing eliade's notion hierophany refers actual existence supernatural level
ronald inden historian india university chicago professor criticized mircea eliade alongside other intellectual figures carl jung joseph campbell among them encouraging romantic view hinduism
argued their approach subject relied mainly orientalist approach made hinduism seem like private realm imagination religious modern western man lacks needs
far right nationalist influences although scholarly work never subordinated early political beliefs school thought associated interwar romania namely trăirism well works julius evola continued draw inspiration thematic links fascism
writer academic marcel tolcea argued through evola's particular interpretation guénon's works eliade kept traceable connection far right ideologies academic contributions
daniel dubuisson singled out eliade's concept homo religiosus reflection fascist elitism argued romanian scholar's views judaism old testament depicted hebrews enemies ancient cosmic religion ultimately preservation antisemitic discourse
piece authored 1930 saw eliade defining julius evola great thinker offering praise controversial intellectuals oswald spengler arthur de gobineau houston stewart chamberlain nazi ideologue alfred rosenberg
evola continued defend core principles mystical fascism once protested eliade latter's failure cite guénon
eliade replied works written contemporary public initiates esoteric circles
after 1960 s together evola louis rougier other intellectuals offered support alain de benoist's controversial groupement de recherche et d'études pour civilisation européenne part nouvelle droite intellectual trend
notably eliade also preoccupied cult zalmoxis supposed monotheism
like conclusion romanization superficial inside roman dacia view celebrated contemporary partisans protochronist nationalism
according historian sorin antohi eliade may actually encouraged protochronists such edgar papu carry out research resulted claim medieval romanians anticipated renaissance
study eliade jung campbell ellwood also discusses connection academic theories controversial political involvements noting three mythologists accused reactionary political positions
ellwood notes obvious parallel conservatism myth speaks primordial golden age conservatism far right politics
however ellwood argues explanation complex
wherever their political sympathies may sometimes claims three mythologists often apolitical antipolitical scorning any this-worldly salvation
moreover connection mythology politics differs each mythologists question eliade's case ellwood believes strong sense nostalgia childhood historical times past cosmic religion paradise influenced scholar's academic interests also political views
because eliade stayed out politics during later life ellwood tries extract implicit political philosophy eliade's scholarly works
ellwood argues later eliade's nostalgia ancient traditions make political reactionary even quiet
concludes later eliade fact radical modernist
according ellwood those see eliade's fascination primordial merely reactionary ordinary political religious sense word understand mature eliade sufficiently radical way
tradition exactly burkean 'prescription' sacred trust kept alive generation after generation eliade fully aware tradition like men nations lives changing even occultation
tack try fruitlessly keep unchanging discover hiding
according eliade religious elements survive secular culture new camouflaged forms
thus ellwood believes later eliade probably thought modern man should preserve elements past should try restore their original form through reactionary politics
suspects eliade favored minimal rather maximalist state allow personal spiritual transformation without enforcing
many scholars accused eliade essentialism type over-generalization incorrectly attributes common essence whole group—in case religious traditional societies
furthermore see connection eliade's essentialism regard religion fascist essentialism regard races nations
ellwood connection seems rather tortured end amounting little ad hominem argument attempts tar eliade's entire [scholarly] work ill-repute decent people feel storm troopers iron guard
however ellwood admits common tendencies mythological thinking may caused eliade well jung campbell view certain groups essentialist way may explain their purported antisemitism tendency think generic terms peoples races religions parties shall see undoubtedly profoundest flaw mythological thinking including such modern mythologists our three connect nascent anti-semitism connection other way
literary works generic traits many mircea eliade's literary works particular earliest ones noted their eroticism their focus subjective experience

specific aspect focus experience sexual experimentation—călinescu notes eliade's fiction works tend depict male figure possessing practicable women [a given] family

călinescu such perspective life culminated banality leaving authors gripped cult self contempt literature
polemically călinescu proposed mircea eliade's supposed focus aggressive youth served instill interwar romanian writers idea common destiny generation apart
