philosophical views plantinga argued people know god exists basic belief requiring no argument
developed argument two different fashions firstly god other minds 1967 drawing equivalence teleological argument common sense view people other minds existing analogy their own minds
plantinga also developed comprehensive epistemological account nature warrant allows existence god basic belief
plantinga also argued there no logical inconsistency existence evil existence all-powerful all-knowing wholly good god
problem evil main article plantinga's free will defense plantinga proposed free will defense volume edited max black 1965 attempts refute logical problem evil argument existence evil logically incompatible existence omnipotent omniscient wholly good god
plantinga's argument truncated form states possible god even being omnipotent create world free creatures never choose evil
furthermore possible god even being omnibenevolent desire create world contains evil moral goodness requires free moral creatures
plantinga's defense received wide acceptance among contemporary philosophers addressing moral evil
however argument's handling natural evil heavily disputed presupposition libertarianist incompatibilist view free will seen problematic well
according internet encyclopedia philosophy argument also conflicts important theistic doctrines including notion heaven idea god free will
mackie sees plantinga's free-will defense incoherent
plantinga's well-received book god freedom evil written 1974 gave response saw incomplete uncritical view theism's criticism theodicy
plantinga's contribution stated issue comprehensive doctrine freedom added discussion goodness god omnipotence god then possible exclude presence evil world after introducing freedom discussion
plantinga's own summary occurs discussion titled god created world containing moral good no moral evil states conclusion
price creating world produce moral good creating also produce moral evil
reformed epistemology plantinga's contributions epistemology include argument dubs reformed epistemology
according reformed epistemology belief god rational justified even without arguments evidence existence god
specifically plantinga argues belief god properly basic due religious externalist epistemology claims belief god justified independently evidence
externalist epistemology called proper functionalism form epistemological reliabilism
plantinga discusses view reformed epistemology proper functionalism three-volume series
first book trilogy warrant current debate plantinga introduces analyzes criticizes 20 th-century developments analytic epistemology particularly works chisholm bon jour alston goldman others
book plantinga argues specifically theories calls “warrant”-what many others called justification plantinga draws out difference justification property person holding belief while warrant property belief—put forth these epistemologists systematically failed capture full required knowledge
second book warrant proper function introduces notion warrant alternative justification discusses topics like self-knowledge memories perception probability
plantinga's proper function account argues necessary condition having warrant one's belief-forming belief-maintaining apparatus powers functioning properly—working way ought work
plantinga explains argument proper function reference design plan well environment one's cognitive equipment optimal use
plantinga asserts design plan does require designer perhaps possible evolution undirected god anyone else somehow furnished us our design plans paradigm case design plan like technological product designed human being like radio wheel
ultimately plantinga argues epistemological naturalism-
epistemology holds warrant dependent natural faculties best supported supernaturalist metaphysics case belief creator god designer laid out design plan includes cognitive faculties conducive attaining knowledge
according plantinga belief warranted cognitive faculties involved production functioning properly… 2 your cognitive environment sufficiently similar your cognitive faculties designed 3 … design plan governing production belief question involves purpose function production true beliefs… 4 design plan good there high statistical objective probability belief produced accordance relevant segment design plan sort environment true
plantinga seeks defend view proper function against alternative views proper function proposed other philosophers groups together naturalistic including functional generalization view john pollock evolutionary/etiological account provided ruth millikan dispositional view held john bigelow robert pargetter
plantinga also discusses evolutionary argument against naturalism later chapters warrant proper function
2000 third volume warranted christian belief published
volume plantinga's warrant theory basis theological end providing philosophical basis christian belief argument why christian theistic belief enjoy warrant
book develops two models such beliefs a/c aquinas/calvin model extended a/c model
former attempts show belief god justified warranted rational while extended model tries show specifically christian theological beliefs including trinity incarnation resurrection christ atonement salvation etc
under model christians justified their beliefs because work holy spirit bringing those beliefs believer
james beilby argued purpose plantinga's warrant trilogy specifically warranted christian belief firstly make form argument against religion impossible—namely argument whether christianity true irrational—so skeptic shoulder formidable task demonstrating falsity christian belief rather simply dismiss irrational
addition plantinga attempting provide philosophical explanation how christians should think their own christian belief
modal ontological argument plantinga expressed modal logic version ontological argument uses modal logic develop rigorous formal way norman malcolm's charles hartshorne's modal ontological arguments
evolutionary argument against naturalism plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism argues truth evolution epistemic defeater naturalism
evolution true undermines naturalism
basic argument evolution naturalism both true human cognitive faculties evolved produce beliefs survival value maximizing one's success four f's feeding fleeing fighting reproducing necessarily produce beliefs true
thus since human cognitive faculties tuned survival rather truth naturalism-evolution model there reason doubt veracity products those same faculties including naturalism evolution themselves
other hand god created man image way evolutionary process any other means then plantinga argues our faculties probably reliable
argument does assume any necessary correlation uncorrelation true beliefs survival
making contrary assumption—that there fact relatively strong correlation truth survival—if human belief-forming apparatus evolved giving survival advantage then ought yield truth since true beliefs confer survival advantage
plantinga counters while there may overlap true beliefs beliefs contribute survival two kinds beliefs same gives following example man named paul perhaps paul very much likes idea being eaten sees tiger runs off looking better prospect because thinks unlikely tiger sees will eat
will get body parts right place far survival concerned without involving much way true belief
perhaps thinks tiger large friendly cuddly pussycat wants pet also believes best way pet run away
clearly there any number belief-desire systems equally fit given bit behaviour
although argument criticized philosophers like elliott sober received favorable notice thomas nagel others

member 'ad hoc origins committee' supported philip e

plantinga also provided back-cover endorsement johnson's book
fellow now moribund pro-intelligent design international society complexity information design presented number intelligent design conferences
march 2010 article chronicle higher education philosopher science michael ruse labeled plantinga open enthusiast intelligent design
letter editor plantinga made following response like any christian indeed any theist believe world created god hence intelligently designed
hallmark intelligent design however claim shown scientifically i'm dubious
far see god certainly used darwinian processes create living world direct wanted go hence evolution such does imply there no direction history life
does implication evolutionary theory itself unguided evolution idea neither god nor any other person taken hand guiding directing orchestrating course evolution
scientific theory evolution sensibly enough says nothing way other divine guidance
doesn't say evolution divinely guided also doesn't say isn't
like almost any theist reject unguided evolution contemporary scientific theory evolution just such—apart philosophical theological add-ons—doesn't say evolution unguided
like science general makes no pronouncements existence activity god
