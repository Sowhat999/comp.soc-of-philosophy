epistemology portrait william james john farge circa 1859 james defined true beliefs those prove useful believer
pragmatic theory truth synthesis correspondence theory truth coherence theory truth added dimension
truth verifiable extent thoughts statements correspond actual things well extent hang together cohere pieces puzzle might fit together these turn verified observed results application idea actual practice
most ancient parts truth
also once plastic
also called true human reasons
also mediated still earlier truths those days novel observations
purely objective truth truth whose establishment function giving human satisfaction marrying previous parts experience newer parts played no role whatsoever nowhere found
reasons why call things true reason why true 'to true' means perform marriage-function
anything short god rational anything god possible
writes first essential god conceived deepest power universe second must conceived under form mental personality
also writes god relish such superfluities horror no god human beings appeal
other words absolute purpose man-like god common people
james held world view line pragmatism declaring value any truth utterly dependent upon use person held
additional tenets james's pragmatism include view world mosaic diverse experiences properly interpreted understood through application radical empiricism
radical empiricism related everyday scientific empiricism asserts world experience never halted entirely objective analysis nothing else mind observer simple act observation will affect outcome any empirical approach truth mind experiences nature inseparable
james's emphasis diversity default human condition—over against duality especially hegelian dialectical duality—has maintained strong influence american culture
james's description mind-world connection described terms stream consciousness direct significant impact avant-garde modernist literature art notably case james joyce
pragmatism means james writes central point own doctrine truth brief truths emerge facts dip forward facts again add them facts again create reveal new truth word indifferent indefinitely
'facts' themselves meanwhile true
truth function beliefs start terminate among them
richard rorty made contested claim james mean give theory truth statement should regard such
however other pragmatism scholars such susan haack howard mounce share rorty's instrumentalist interpretation james
meaning truth james seems speak truth relativistic terms critic's [sc
critic pragmatism] trouble
seems come taking word 'true' irrelatively whereas pragmatist means 'true experiences workings
however james responded critics accusing relativism scepticism agnosticism believing relative truths
contrary supported epistemological realism position
pragmatism cash value introduction william james's pragmatism bruce kuklick p
james went apply pragmatic method epistemological problem truth
seek meaning 'true' examining how idea functioned our lives
belief true worked us guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world
james anxious uncover true beliefs amounted human life their cash value consequences led
belief mental entity somehow mysteriously corresponded external reality belief true
beliefs ways acting reference precarious environment say true say efficacious environment
sense pragmatic theory truth applied darwinian ideas philosophy made survival test intellectual well biological fitness
will believe doctrine main article will believe william james's lecture 1896 titled will believe james defends right violate principle evidentialism order justify hypothesis venturing
idea foresaw 20 th century objections evidentialism sought ground justified belief unwavering principle prove beneficial
through philosophy pragmatism william james justifies religious beliefs using results hypothetical venturing evidence support hypothesis' truth
therefore doctrine allows assume belief god prove existence belief brings one's life
free will will believe james simply asserted will free
first act freedom chose believe will free
encouraged reading charles renouvier whose work convinced james convert monism pluralism
diary entry april 30 1870 james think yesterday crisis my life
finished first part renouvier's second essais see no reason why definition free will—the sustaining thought because choose might other thoughts—need definition illusion
any rate will assume present—until next year—that no illusion
my first act free will shall believe free will
1884 james set terms future discussions determinism compatibilism free will debates lecture harvard divinity school students published dilemma determinism
talk defined common terms hard determinism soft determinism now commonly called compatibilism
old-fashioned determinism may call hard determinism
shrink such words fatality bondage will necessitation like
nowadays soft determinism abhors harsh words repudiating fatality necessity even predetermination says real name freedom freedom necessity understood bondage highest identical true freedom
james called compatibilism quagmire evasion just ideas thomas hobbes david hume — free will simply freedom external coercion — called wretched subterfuge immanuel kant
james described chance neither hard nor soft determinism indeterminism
stronghold determinist argument antipathy idea chance
notion alternative possibility admission any several things may come pass after roundabout name chance
james asked students consider choice walking home lowell lecture hall after talk
meant saying my choice way walk home after lecture ambiguous matter chance?
means both divinity avenue oxford street called either shall chosen
simple example james laid out two-stage decision process chance present time random alternatives leading choice possibility transforms ambiguous future simple unalterable past
james’ two-stage model separates chance undetermined alternative possibilities choice free action individual randomness no effect
subsequent thinkers using model include henri poincaré arthur holly compton karl popper
philosophy religion excerpt
james important work philosophy religion
gifford lectures university edinburgh provided wide-ranging account varieties religious experience 1902 interpreted them according pragmatic leanings
important claims makes regard religious genius experience should primary topic study religion rather religious institutions—since institutions merely social descendant genius
intense even pathological varieties experience religious otherwise should sought psychologists because represent closest thing microscope mind—that show us drastically enlarged form normal processes things
order usefully interpret realm common shared experience history must each make certain over-beliefs things while cannot proven basis experience help us live fuller better lives
james investigated mystical experiences throughout life leading experiment chloral hydrate 1870 amyl nitrite 1875 nitrous oxide 1882 peyote 1896
[citation needed] james claimed under influence nitrous oxide able understand hegel
concluded while revelations mystic hold true hold true mystic others certainly ideas considered hold no claim truth without personal experience such
american philosophy encyclopedia classes several figures took pantheist pandeist approach rejecting views god separate world
instincts see also instinct like sigmund freud james influenced charles darwin's theory natural selection
core james' theory psychology defined principles psychology 1890 system instincts
james humans many instincts even other animals
these instincts overridden experience each other many instincts actually conflict each other
1920 s however psychology turned away evolutionary theory embraced radical behaviorism
theory emotion james two namesakes james–lange theory emotion formulated independently carl lange 1880 s
theory holds emotion mind's perception physiological conditions result stimulus
james's oft-cited example see bear fear run see bear run consequently fear bear
our mind's perception higher adrenaline level heartbeat etc
way thinking emotion great consequences philosophy aesthetics
here passage great work principles psychology spells out those consequences [w]e must immediately insist aesthetic emotion pure simple pleasure given us certain lines masses combinations colors sounds absolutely sensational experience optical auricular feeling primary due repercussion backwards other sensations elsewhere consecutively aroused
simple primary immediate pleasure certain pure sensations harmonious combinations them there may true added secondary pleasures practical enjoyment works art masses mankind these secondary pleasures play great part
classic one's taste however less relatively important secondary pleasures felt comparison those primary sensation comes
classicism romanticism their battles over point
theory emotion also independently developed italy anthropologist giuseppe sergi
order give due credit such theory should called james-lange-sergi theory emotion
william james' bear joseph le doux's description william james's emotion why run away notice danger? because afraid will happen don't
obvious answer seemingly trivial question central concern century-old debate nature our emotions
began 1884 william james published article titled emotion? article appeared philosophy journal called mind there no psychology journals yet
important because definitively answered question raised because way james phrased response
conceived emotion terms sequence events starts occurrence arousing stimulus {the sympathetic nervous system parasympathetic nervous system} ends passionate feeling conscious emotional experience
major goal emotion research still elucidate stimulus-to-feeling sequence—to figure out processes come stimulus feeling
james set out answer question asking another run bear because afraid afraid because run? proposed obvious answer run because afraid wrong instead argued afraid because run our natural way thinking
emotions mental perception fact excites mental affection called emotion latter state mind gives rise bodily expression
my thesis contrary bodily changes follow directly perception exciting fact our feeling same changes occur emotion called 'feeling' damasio
essence james's proposal simple
premised fact emotions often accompanied bodily responses racing heart tight stomach sweaty palms tense muscles sympathetic nervous system sense going inside our body much same sense going outside world
according james emotions feel different other states mind because these bodily responses give rise internal sensations different emotions feel different another because accompanied different bodily responses sensations
example see james's bear run away
during act escape body goes through physiological upheaval blood pressure rises heart rate increases pupils dilate palms sweat muscles contract certain ways evolutionary innate defense mechanisms
other kinds emotional situations will result different bodily upheavals
each case physiological responses return brain form bodily sensations unique pattern sensory feedback gives each emotion unique quality
fear feels different anger love because different physiological signature {the parasympathetic nervous system love}
mental aspect emotion feeling slave physiology vice versa tremble because afraid cry because feel sad afraid because tremble sad because cry
philosophy history long-standing schisms philosophy history concerns role individuals social change
faction sees individuals seen dickens' tale two cities thomas carlyle's french revolution history motive power history broader society page write their acts
other sees society moving according holistic principles laws sees individuals more-or-less willing pawns
1880 james waded controversy great men great thoughts environment essay published atlantic monthly
took carlyle's side without carlyle's one-sided emphasis political/military sphere upon heroes founders overthrowers states empires
philosopher according james must accept geniuses given entity same way biologist accepts entity darwin's ‘spontaneous variations
’ role individual will depend degree conformity social environment epoch moment etc
james introduces notion receptivities moment
societies' mutations generation generation determined directly indirectly mainly acts examples individuals whose genius adapted receptivities moment whose accidental position authority critical became ferments initiators movements setters precedent fashion centers corruption destroyers other persons whose gifts free play led society another direction
view spiritualism associationism william james séance spiritualist medium james studied closely schools thought known associationism spiritualism
view associationist each experience leads another creating chain events
association does tie together two ideas rather physical objects
association occurs atomic level
small physical changes occur brain eventually form complex ideas associations
thoughts formed these complex ideas work together lead new experiences
isaac newton david hartley both precursors school thought proposing such ideas physical vibrations brain spinal cord nerves basis sensations ideas motions
james disagreed associationism believed too simple
referred associationism psychology without soul because there nothing within creating ideas just arise associating objects another
other hand spiritualist believes mental events attributed soul
whereas associationism ideas behaviors separate spiritualism connected
spiritualism encompasses term innatism suggests ideas cause behavior
ideas past behavior influence way person will act future these ideas tied together soul
therefore inner soul causes thought leads them perform behavior memory past behaviors determine how will act future
james strong opinion these schools thought
nature pragmatist thus took view should use whatever parts theories make most sense proven
therefore recommended breaking apart spiritualism associationism using parts them make most sense
james believed each person soul exists spiritual universe leads person perform behaviors physical world
james influenced emanuel swedenborg first introduced idea
james stated although does appear humans use associations move event next cannot done without soul tying everything together
after association made person decides part focus therefore determines direction following associations will lead
associationism too simple does account decision-making future behaviors memory worked well
spiritualism however does demonstrate actual physical representations how associations occur
james combined views spiritualism associationism create own way thinking
james founding member vice president american society psychical research
lending name made leonora piper famous medium
1885 year after death young son james first sitting piper suggestion mother-in-law
james soon convinced piper knew things she discovered supernatural means
expressed belief piper saying you wish upset law crows black enough you prove crow white
my white crow mrs
however james believe piper contact spirits
after evaluating sixty-nine reports piper's mediumship considered hypothesis telepathy well piper obtaining information her sitters natural means such her memory recalling information
according james spirit-control hypothesis her mediumship incoherent irrelevant cases demonstrably false
james held séances piper impressed details given however according massimo polidoro maid household james friendly maid piper's house may source information piper used private details james
bibliographers frederick burkhardt fredson bowers compiled works james thus possible mrs
piper's knowledge james family acquired gossip servants whole mystery rests failure people upstairs realize servants [downstairs] also ears
jamesian theory self william james developed theory self divided two main categories
first me self second self
me self refers aspects someone come person's experiences
james broke me self down three sections material self social self spiritual self
james self classified thinking self
james linked self soul person now think mind
pure ego name given self
material self material self consists things belong us belong
things like family clothes our body money makes up our material selves
james core material self body
second body person's clothes important material self well
james believed people's clothes way expressed way show status thus contributing formation self
money family also part material self
james felt lost family member part gone well
money part material self same way
point lot money then lost person change well
social self our social selves given social situation
james people change how act depending social situation
james believed people many social selves social situations participated
example person may act different way work compared how same person may act out group friends
james also believed given social group individual's social self may divided even further
example social context individual's work environment difference behavior individual interacting their boss versus their behavior interacting co-worker
spiritual self james spiritual self our core
spiritual self concrete permanent other two selves
spiritual self our subjective most intimate self
aspects individual's spiritual self include things like their personality core values conscience typically change throughout their lifetime
spiritual self involves introspection looking inward deeper spiritual moral intellectual questions without influence objective thoughts
james achieving high level understanding our core understanding our spiritual selves rewarding satisfying needs social material selves
pure ego pure ego james refers self
james pure ego provides thread continuity our past present future selves
pure ego's perception consistent individual identity arises continual stream consciousness
james believed pure ego similar think soul mind
pure ego substance therefore examined science
