suzuki's contrasting view centuries development china zen chan absorbed much indigenous chinese taoism
suzuki believed far eastern peoples sensitive attuned nature either people europe those northern india
[citation needed] suzuki subscribed idea religions each sort organism through time subject irritation having capacity change evolve
[citation needed] suzuki's contention zen satori awakening goal tradition's training distinguished tradition developed through centuries china way life radically different indian buddhists
india tradition mendicant holy beggar bhikku pali prevailed china social circumstances led development temple training-center system abbot monks performed mundane tasks

echoed nishitani keiji declared
suzuki's activities buddhism came possess forward-moving direction frontier spirit
involved shouldering task rethinking restating redoing traditional buddhism transmit westerners well easterners
accomplish task necessary deeply engrossed tradition same time grasp longing way thinking within hearts westerners
there new possibilities should open up study buddha dharma yet found buddhist history
up now new buddhist path blazed almost single-handedly dr
behalf whole buddhist world
[citation needed] buddhist modernism suzuki university-educated intellectual steeped knowledge western philosophy literature allowed particularly successful persuasive presenting case western audience
suzuki portrayed zen buddhism highly practical religion whose emphasis direct experience made particularly comparable forms mysticism scholars such william james emphasized fountainhead religious sentiment
idea common essence made suzuki's ideas recognizable western audience identify western esotericism concealed disguised eastern metaphysics
suzuki presents version zen described detraditionalized essentialized
resemblance coincidental since suzuki also influenced western esotericism even joined theosophical society
several scholars identified suzuki buddhist modernist
scholar david mc mahan describes buddhist modernism consists forms buddhism emerged out engagement dominant cultural intellectual forces modernity
most scholars agree influence protestant enlightenment values largely defined conspicuous attributes buddhist modernism
mc mahan cites western monotheism rationalism scientific naturalism romantic expressivism influences
buddhist modernist traditions often consist deliberate de-emphasis ritual metaphysical elements religion these elements seen incommensurate discourses modernity
buddhist modernist traditions also characterized being detraditionalized often being presented way occludes their historical construction
instead buddhist modernists often employ essentialized description their tradition key tenets described universal sui generis
form zen popularized west popular lay image zen notably notion zen refers specific school buddhism rather mystical spiritual gnosis transcends sectarian boundaries largely twentieth-century construct
beginning persecution buddhism early meiji haibutsu kishaku zen apologists forced respond secular empiricist critiques religion general japanese nativist critiques buddhism foreign funerary cult particular
response partisans zen drew upon western philosophical theological strategies their attempt adapt their faith modern age
criticism suzuki criticized essentialist approach
early 1951 hu shih criticized suzuki presenting idealist picture zen
mc mahan states discussion humanity nature suzuki takes zen literature out social ritual ethical contexts reframes terms language metaphysics derived german romantic idealism english romanticism american transcendentalism
suzuki's approach marked incomprehensible
suzuki whose most cherished methodology seems describe aspect zen beyond ordinary explanation then offer suitably incomprehensible story two way illustration
obviously suzuki's approach captured imaginations generations readers
however while approach substantiated suzuki's authority insider access profound truths tradition another result increase confusion reader's minds
question such accounts admit get distance oneself even further goal achieving suzuki termed zen enlightenment experience

january 2013 according sharf victoria suzuki associated japanese nationalism propagation via appraisal japanese zen
criticised defending japanese war-efforts though suzuki's thoughts these also placed context western supremacy first half 20 th century reaction against supremacy asian countries
[citation needed] sympathy nazism anti-semitism brian victoria delivered lectures germany revealed evidence suzuki's sympathy nazi regime
victoria writes
suzuki left record early view nazi movement included series articles published japanese buddhist newspaper chūgai nippō october 3 4 6 13 1936
suzuki expresses agreement hitler's policies explained relative living germany
while don't know much politics never enjoyed greater peace mind now
alone want cheer hitler
my relative me
quite understandable am agreement
also expresses agreement hitler's expulsion jews germany
changing topic hitler's expulsion jews appears too there lot reasons actions
while very cruel policy looked point view current future happiness entire german people may time sort extreme action necessary order preserve nation
while supporting anti-jewish measures stating
extreme action necessary preserve nation
suzuki expressed sympathy individual jews
regards individuals truly regrettable situation
new buddhism onset modernization meji period 1868 japan entered international community buddhism briefly persecuted japan corrupt decadent anti-social parasitic superstitious creed inimical japan's need scientific technological advancement
japanese government intended eradicate tradition seen foreign other incapable fostering nativist sentiments vital national ideological cohesion
addition industrialization led breakdown parishioner system funded buddhist monasteries centuries
however group modern buddhist leaders emerged argue buddhist cause
these leaders stood agreement government persecution buddhism accepting notion corrupt buddhist institution need revitalization
response modernisation japan persecution buddhism shin bukkyo new buddhism came existence
led university-educated intellectuals exposed vast body western intellectual literature
advocates new buddhism like suzuki's teachers kosen successor soyen shaku saw movement defense buddhism against government persecution also saw way bring their nation modern world competitive cultural force
scholars such martin verhoeven[citation needed] robert sharf well japanese zen monk g
victor sogen hori argued breed japanese zen propagated new buddhism ideologues such imakita kosen soyen shaku typical japanese zen during their time nor typical japanese zen now
importance lies especially within western zen suffice say just writings suzuki hisamatsu representative traditional
pre-meiji zen exegetics style zen training most familiar western zen practitioners traced relatively recent sociologically marginal japanese lay movements neither sanction nor respect modern rinzai sōtō monastic orthodoxies
indeed feature shared virtually figures responsible western interest zen their relatively marginal status within japanese zen establishment
while suzuki nishida their intellectual heirs may shaped manner westerners come think zen influence these japanese intellectuals established zen sects japan negligible
point necessary affirm japanese zen monasticism indeed still alive despite shrill invectives expatriate zen missionaries insist authentic zen no longer found japan
traditional form zen greatly altered meiji restoration japanese zen still flourishes monastic tradition
zen tradition japan customary form required great deal time discipline monks laity difficulty finding
zen monks often expected spent several years intensive doctrinal study memorizing sutras poring over commentaries before even entering monastery undergo koan practice sanzen roshi
fact suzuki himself able layman largely invention new buddhism
japanese nationalism during meiji restoration nihonjinron-philosophy took prevalence
emphasizes uniqueness japanese
uniqueness attributed many different factors
suzuki attributed zen
view zen embodies ultimate essence philosophy religion
pictured zen unique expression asian spirituality considered superior western ways thinking
sharf criticizes uniqueness-theses propagated suzuki nihonjinron cultural exceptionalism polemic suzuki's work—the grotesque caricatures 'east' versus 'west'—is no doubt most egregiously inane manifestation nationalist leanings
sharf also doubts motivations suzuki led suspect suzuki's lifelong effort bring buddhist enlightenment occident become inextricably bound studied contempt west
kemmyō taira satō does agree critical assessment suzuki cases suzuki directly expresses position contemporary political situation—whether articles public talks letters friends no reason misrepresent views—he clear explicit distrust opposition state shinto rightwing thought other forces pushing japan toward militarism war even expressed interest decidedly non-rightist ideologies like socialism
suzuki's standpoint consistent late nineteenth century through postwar years
these materials reveal suzuki intellectual independence healthy scepticism political ideology government propaganda sound appreciation human rights
praise suzuki's work later years
contemporaries suzuki acclaimed works
suzuki's books widely read commented many important figures
notable example introduction zen buddhism includes 30-page commentary famous analytical psychologist carl jung suzuki suzuki's works zen buddhism among best contributions knowledge living buddhism
