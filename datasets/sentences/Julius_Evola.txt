ascesis initiation according julius evola tradition purest form encompassed asceticism described doctrine awakening attainment self-mastery according earliest buddhist texts discipline
describes two basic complementary types asceticism — action contemplation
asceticism action personified warrior while contemplation pure ascetic described buddhism highest form asceticism contemplation form very suitable warrior preparation inner outer warfare
metaphysics war metaphysics war evola describes how adapting language war means through warrior called higher form spiritual existence
towards aim adopts language greater lesser jihad explaining how greater jihad spiritual struggle help transform oneself create metaphysical basis opposing modernity
also explains how use spiritual language warfare metaphysically appropriate

metaphysics sex yoga power tantra shakti secret way also eros mysteries love metaphysics sex evola described practice sexual magic asceticism action allows achieve transcendent states through physical action primarily sex
explain metaphysics sex evola cites original meaning word orgy state inspired exaltation began initiatory process ancient greek mysteries
exaltation eros itself akin other experiences supersensual nature becomes individualized longing carnal then deteriorates ends finally form constituted mere pleasure venereal lust
sexual philosophy evola followed esoteric hindu buddhist schools teaching retention semen means ontological energization ultimate self-mastery
virya spiritual manhood lost wasted results death withheld conserved leads life
evola considered traditional chastity signifying control limit anti-titanic purity overcoming pride immaterial unshakability rather moralistic sexuophobic concept evola considered sex greatest magical force nature through magnetic polarity complementary nature two sexes brings possibility erotic transcendence
according evola homosexuality
forms complex problem point view metaphysics
names eros essence platonic love sees carnal development first stage fall
referred heterosexual love also love epheboi male paramours
now let us consider eros those exalted forms linked aesthetic factor according platonic sequence
should pass
rapture aroused incorporeal beauty
there no real problem accidental starting point being same sex
word uranism use mean homosexuality springs plato's
aphrodite urania
goddess noble love carnal unconcerned procreation love woman object
led increasingly carnal developments ancient customs greece rome declined
“if therefore assume homosexuality conform these carnal conditions
then may well describe deviation
standpoint metaphysics sex
refuting plato evola sees homosexuality lacking magic force transcendency
“it inappropriate apply plato does metaphysical meaning made evident myth hermaphrodite homosexual love love practiced pederasts lesbians
fact case such love no longer allowable speak impulse male female principle present primordial being reunited
loses meaning namely idea polarity complementary nature two sexes basis magnetism love transcendency eros blinding destructive revelation
evola sees two forms homosexuality whether inborn acquired lower level
“to find explanation necessary descend lower level examine various empirical possibilities
normally two forms homosexuality distinguished sexology inborn natural character whereas other acquired character conditioned psychological sociological factors influenced person's environment
second these forms necessary give proper value distinction forms having vicious nature forms presuppose latent predisposition aroused under given circumstances
sees inborn homosexuality incomplete sexual development
“it important however consider inborn form homosexuality rigid way allow certain possibility variation
natural homosexuality
process sexual development physical even psychic aspects incomplete
evola acquired homosexuality driving contemporary homosexuality boom
“but necessary
also bear mind cases regression
surroundings general atmosphere society play unimportant part
civilization equality standard differences linked promiscuity favor ancient idea 'being true oneself' means nothing anymore—in such splintered materialistic society clear phenomenon regression homosexuality should particularly welcome therefore no way surprise see alarming increase homosexuality 'third sex' latest 'democratic' period increase sex changes extent unparalleled other eras
defining homosexuality furthermore evola adds decidedly manly pleasure perversion driven “mutual masturbator” different variety homosexual
“but reference
incomplete process development sex regression does explain varieties homosexuality
fact there male homosexuals effeminate
even men war individuals decidedly manly their appearance behavior powerful men most beautiful women their disposal
such homosexuality hard explain right here speak deviation perversion vice linked perhaps fashion
however there reason suppose merely matter mutual masturbation conditioned reflexes exploited pleasure since metaphysical also physical premises whole destructive union lacking
finally evola rebukes bisexuality expressing chaotic desire try everything
“on other hand classical antiquity bears witness
toa bisexual attitude both women young men used
here seems governing motivation simply desire try everything
may also refer crude saying
enough girl girl she play part boy
claim ideal nature hermaphroditic wholeness pederast acts both man woman sexually obvious fallacious beyond level straightforward sensations hermaphroditic wholeness sufficiency no need another being sought level spiritual realization excludes nuances magic two offer heterosexual unions
evola repudiates turkish japanese homosexuality justifications through feelings power
“even rationale sometimes found countries such turkey japan homosexual possession gives feeling power convincing
pleasure domination also felt women other beings situations free sexual intercourse
besides such pleasure involved completely pathological context develop true orgasm
thus evola concludes “when homosexuality natural else cannot explained terms incomplete inborn forms sexual development must character deviation vice perversion
even extreme erotic homosexual intensity no higher meaning evola experience rooted displacement eros
“and instances extreme erotic intensity relations homosexuals should adduced explanation sought possibility displacement eros
indeed enough go through any treatise sexual psychopathology see how many unthinkable situations erotic potential human being aroused sometimes level orgiastic frenzy fetishism even animal sodomy necrophilia
same anomalous background include case homosexuality although latter much frequent displaced eros being same sex serve simple occasional cause support many cases psychopathy although must wholly lack every profound dimension every meaning higher experience because absence necessary ontological metaphysical premises
evola's attitude towards homosexuality reflected reference plotinus deemed homosexual loves shameful abnormal like diseases degenerate persons arise essence being outcome development thereof enneads iii
evola scorned modern pornography being scanty source erotic experience denouncing dreadfully squalid facts scenes described essence
politics there contradictory views among scholars evola's political categorization possible relationship fascism neofascism

evola called italy's fascist movement laughable revolution based empty sentiment materialistic concerns
opposed futurism italian fascism aligned along plebeian nature movement
revolt against modern world evola clearly cites monarchism preferred form government given monarch hold spiritual principles above state enforce hierarchy warriors priests merchants scholars viewed universal traditional societies
although never[citation needed] formally aligned himself such school see strong similarities evola's thought conservative revolutionary movement germany such traditionalist worldview rejecting purely biological concept race 'self'
evola held[citation needed] politics like everything else life should look upward beyond self
main argument against modern demagogic politics materialistic focus mentality stemming inverted order castes
accordingly modernity due calls regression castes once-preeminent warrior caste crystallized medieval military religious orders ethical chivalry warrior code downgraded figures mere democratic soldier mercenary servants artificial soulless needs now-dominant mercantile industrial interests
evola states opposite 'soldier' type warrior member feudal aristocracy caste type belonged central nucleus corresponding social organization
caste service bourgeois class rather ruled over since class protected depended those right bear arms meaning anti-'bourgeoisie' stance evola stated anti-bourgeois descending sense subversive collectivists sense opposing dominance lower manifestations modern bourgeois spirit effeminate materialism commercialism gangsterism etc
bourgeois tendency inevitable role society must absolutized rather bourgeoisie must purified contained values given their space subordinated superior values
anti-bourgeois because bourgeois type while ranking above proletarian yet stands inferior soldierly-heroic spiritual-priestly orders
bourgeois type compared sacral-warrior represents lesser degree progressive manhood
evola attempted influence italy's fascist movement conservative-revolutionary direction believed should go — direction radical traditionalism

decade immediately following war evola two books fall loosely categories asceticism action asceticism contemplation their prescriptions political action

attitude sort asceticism action calling political action reform current society conservative-revolutionary / radical traditional direction
also felt acceleration modernity following world war ii's outcome thus elimination any truly opposing forces made any such revolution rather impossible unless 'unforeseeable' imposes radical change circumstances
ride tiger prescribed so-to-speak apolitical asceticism contemplation man advised act modern world while remaining intellectually spiritually detached above

non-aryan hazardous — mixture 'related' races might produce hybrid vigor
