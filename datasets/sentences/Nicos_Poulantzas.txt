theory state poulantzas's theory state reacted saw simplistic understandings within marxism
instrumentalist marxist accounts held state simply instrument hands particular class
poulantzas disagreed because saw capitalist class too focused individual short-term profit rather maintaining class's power whole simply exercise whole state power own interest
poulantzas argued state though relatively autonomous capitalist class nonetheless functions ensure smooth operation capitalist society therefore benefits capitalist class
particular focused how inherently divisive system such capitalism coexist social stability necessary reproduce itself—looking particular nationalism means overcome class divisions within capitalism
poulantzas particularly influential over leading contemporary marxist state theorist bob jessop
borrowing antonio gramsci's notion cultural hegemony poulantzas argued repressing movements oppressed sole function state
rather state power must also obtain consent oppressed
does through class alliances dominant group makes alliance subordinate groups means obtain consent subordinate group
later works poulantzas analysed role termed new petty bourgeoisie both consolidating ruling classes hegemony undermining proletariat's ability organise itself
occupying contradictory class position—that say identifying de facto oppressor—this fraction working class throws lot bourgeois whose fate wrongly believes shares
fragmentation argue demise class system poulantzas defining characteristic late capitalism any politically useful analysis must tackle new constellation interests power
highly abbreviated example seen poulantzas-influenced analysis new deal united states american ruling class acceding demands labour things like minimum wage labour laws etc
helped cement alliance labour particular fraction capital state levine 1988
necessary continued existence capitalism ruling class simply repressed movements avoided making any concessions led socialist revolution
legacy poulantzas provides nuanced analysis class structure era internationalisation production systems today globalisation shifting power labour capitalist classes
many areas foresaw current debate critical marxian language class bourgeoisie hegemony finds little echo contemporary political science positivism requires researchers focus putative measurable objective entities
however placing class analysis center political analysis poulantzas reminds us theorists political agents themselves accounts political world suffused ambient ideology suppose themselves bracket
