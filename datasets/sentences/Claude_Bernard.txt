works claude bernard's aim stated own words establish use scientific method medicine
dismissed many previous misconceptions took nothing granted relied experimentation
unlike most contemporaries insisted living creatures bound same laws inanimate matter
claude bernard's first important work functions pancreas juice proved great significance process digestion achievement won prize experimental physiology french academy sciences
second investigation - perhaps most famous - glycogenic function liver course study led conclusion throws light causation diabetes mellitus liver addition secreting bile seat internal secretion prepares sugar expense elements blood passing through
third research resulted discovery vasomotor system
1851 while examining effects produced temperature various parts body section nerve nerves belonging them noticed division cervical sympathetic nerve gave rise active circulation forcible pulsation arteries certain parts head few months afterwards observed electrical excitation upper portion divided nerve contrary effect
way established existence vasomotor nerves both vasodilator vasoconstrictor
milieu interieur milieu intérieur key process bernard associated
stability internal environment [the milieu intérieur] condition free independent life
underlying principle later called homeostasis term coined walter bradford cannon
also explained living body though need surrounding environment nevertheless relatively independent
independence organism external environment derives fact living being tissues fact withdrawn direct external influences protected veritable internal environment constituted particular fluids circulating body
[citation needed] constancy internal environment condition free independent life mechanism makes possible assured maintenance within internal environment conditions necessary life elements
constancy environment presupposes perfection organism such external variations every instant compensated brought balance
consequence far being indifferent external world higher animal contrary close wise relation equilibrium results continuous delicate compensation established most sensitive balances
study physiological action poisons also great interest attention being devoted particular curare carbon monoxide gas
vivisection bernard's scientific discoveries made through vivisection primary proponent europe time
physiologist no ordinary man
learned man man possessed absorbed scientific idea
does hear animals' cries pain
blind blood flows
sees nothing idea organisms conceal secrets resolved discover
bernard practiced vivisection disgust wife daughters returned home discover vivisected their dog
couple officially separated 1869 wife went actively campaign against practice vivisection
wife daughters ones disgusted bernard's animal experiments
physician-scientist george hoggan spent four months observing working bernard's laboratory few contemporary authors chronicle went there
later moved write experiences bernard's lab made prepared see science even mankind perish rather recourse such means saving
introduction study experimental medicine claude bernard pupils major discourse scientific method introduction study experimental medicine 1865 bernard described makes scientific theory good makes scientist important true discoverer
unlike many scientific writers time bernard own experiments thoughts used first person
known unknown
makes scientist important states how well she penetrated unknown
areas science facts known everyone scientists less equal—we cannot know great
area science still obscure unknown great recognized marked ideas light up phenomena hitherto obscure carry science forward
authority vs
through experimental method science carried forward—not through uncritically accepting authority academic scholastic sources
experimental method observable reality our authority
bernard writes scientific fervor meet fact contradicts prevailing theory must accept fact abandon theory even theory supported great names generally accepted
induction deduction
experimental science constant interchange theory fact induction deduction
induction reasoning particular general deduction reasoning general particular never truly separate
general theory our theoretical deductions must tested specific experiments designed confirm deny their truth while these particular experiments may lead us formulate new theories
cause effect
scientist tries determine relation cause effect
true sciences goal connect natural phenomenon immediate cause
formulate hypotheses elucidating see relation cause effect particular phenomena
test hypotheses
hypothesis proved scientific theory
before groping empiricism
verification disproof
bernard explains makes theory good bad scientifically theories hypotheses verified less numerous facts
those verified most facts best even then never final never absolutely believed
claude bernard verified found cause? bernard states indeed proof given condition precedes accompanies phenomenon does warrant concluding certainty given condition immediate cause phenomenon
must still established condition removed phenomenon will no longer appear… must try disprove our own theories
solidly settle our ideas trying destroy our own conclusions counter-experiments
observably true authority
through experiment you contradict your own conclusions—you must accept contradiction—but condition contradiction proved
determinism averages
study disease real effective cause disease must constant determined unique anything else denial science medicine
fact very frequent application mathematics biology [is] use averages—that statistics—which may give apparent accuracy
sometimes averages give kind information needed save lives
example great surgeon performs operations stone single method later makes statistical summary deaths recoveries concludes these statistics mortality law operation two out five
well say ratio means literally nothing scientifically gives us no certainty performing next operation know whether next case will among recoveries deaths
really should done instead gathering facts empirically study them accurately each special determinism…
discover them cause mortal accidents master cause avoid accidents
although application mathematics every aspect science ultimate goal biology still too complex poorly understood
therefore now goal medical science should discover new facts possible
qualitative analysis must precede quantitative analysis
truth vs
philosophic spirit writes bernard active desire truth
stimulates kind thirst unknown ennobles enlivens science—where experimenters need stand face face nature
minds great never self-satisfied still continue strive
among great minds names joseph priestley blaise pascal
meanwhile there those whose minds bound cramped
oppose discovering unknown generally unforeseen relation included theory because want discover anything might disprove their own theories
bernard calls them despisers their fellows says dominant idea these despisers their fellows find others' theories faulty try contradict them
deceptive their experiments report results make their theories seem correct suppress results support their rivals
way falsify science facts make poor observations because choose among results their experiments suits their object neglecting whatever unrelated carefully setting aside everything might tend toward idea wish combat
discovering vs
despisers their fellows lack ardent desire knowledge true scientific spirit will have—and progress science will never stopped them
bernard writes ardent desire knowledge fact motive attracting supporting investigators their efforts just knowledge really grasped yet flying before them becomes once their sole torment their sole happiness…
man science rises ever seeking truth never finds wholeness discovers nevertheless very significant fragments these fragments universal truth precisely constitutes science
