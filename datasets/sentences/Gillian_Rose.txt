philosophy dialectic nihilism 1984 rose's third book dialectic nihilism reading post-structuralism through lens law
specifically she attempts read number thinkers preceding constituting post-structuralist philosophy against kant's defense 'usurpatory concept' freedom answer question how [reason] justify possession freedom through pure reason systematically arranged
rose's primary foci martin heidegger whom she devotes three chapters gilles deleuze michel foucault jacques derrida whom she devotes chapter apiece
addition however she scrutinises few neo-kantians emil lask rudolf stammler hermann cohen henri bergson ferdinand de saussure claude lévi-strauss
her central claim post-structuralists newly insinuated law [is] dissembled nihilistic break knowledge law tradition general
describing situation case foucault rose writes like nihilist programmes insinuates new law disguised beyond politics
concomitantly rose contends similar fates befall neo-kantians other thinkers try transcend ignore problems law
according rose neo-kantians seek resolve kantian antinomy law drawing 'original' category out critique pure reason 'mathesis' 'time' 'power' yet remain unable because [t]his mode resolution
depends changing old sticking point unknown categorical imperative new vanishing point remains equally categorical imperative unknowable forceful while other thinkers—including lévi-strauss henri bergson—fall familiar transcendental problem wherein ambiguity relation conditioned precondition exploited
philosopher howard caygill—also rose's literary executor—has taken issue her readings deleuze derrida dialectic nihilism going far call them frankly tendentious
critical review book roy boyne too claims rose failed justice these figures
she operates highest plane abstraction boyne writes level polemic makes any sense
she drop down level she see position she concerned defend under attack quarters she addresses herself
however caygill insists whatever shortcomings readings dialectic nihilism unfortunate unnecessary borders raised rose's thought many her contemporaries mark further stage her retrieval speculative thought
scott lash asserted real weakness dialectic nihilism propensity toward academic point-scoring result according lash rose's devoting half length attempting discredit analysts under consideration their own assumptions rather straightforwardly confronting them her own juridical prescriptions
yet lash considers her chapters derrida foucault partial remedies issue
