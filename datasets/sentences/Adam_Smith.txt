wealth nations main article wealth nations later building site smith wealth nations there disagreement classical neoclassical economists central message smith's most influential work inquiry nature causes wealth nations 1776
neoclassical economists emphasise smith's invisible hand concept mentioned middle work book iv chapter ii classical economists believe smith stated programme promoting wealth nations first sentences attributes growth wealth prosperity division labour
smith used term invisible hand history astronomy referring invisible hand jupiter once each theory moral sentiments 1759 wealth nations 1776
last statement invisible hand interpreted numerous ways
every individual therefore endeavours much both employ capital support domestic industry direct industry produce may greatest value every individual necessarily labours render annual revenue society great
generally indeed neither intends promote public interest nor knows how much promoting
preferring support domestic foreign industry intends own security directing industry such manner produce may greatest value intends own gain many other cases led invisible hand promote end no part intention
nor worse society no part
pursuing own interest frequently promotes society effectually really intends promote
never known much good done those affected trade public good
affectation indeed very common among merchants very few words need employed dissuading them
those regard statement smith's central message also quote frequently smith's dictum benevolence butcher brewer baker expect our dinner their regard their own interest
address ourselves their humanity their self-love never talk them our own necessities their advantages
first page wealth nations 1776 london edition smith's statement benefits invisible hand may meant answer[citation needed] mandeville's contention private vices
may turned public benefits
shows smith's belief individual pursues self-interest under conditions justice unintentionally promotes good society
self-interested competition free market argued tend benefit society whole keeping prices low while still building incentive wide variety goods services
nevertheless wary businessmen warned their conspiracy against public other contrivance raise prices
again again smith warned collusive nature business interests may form cabals monopolies fixing highest price squeezed out buyers
smith also warned business-dominated political system allow conspiracy businesses industry against consumers former scheming influence politics legislation
smith states interest manufacturers merchants
any particular branch trade manufactures respects different even opposite public
proposal any new law regulation commerce comes order ought listened great precaution ought never adopted till after having long carefully examined most scrupulous most suspicious attention
thus smith's chief worry seems business given special protections privileges government contrast absence such special political favours believed business activities generally beneficial whole society great multiplication production different arts consequence division labour occasions well-governed society universal opulence extends itself lowest ranks people
every workman great quantity own work dispose beyond himself occasion every other workman being exactly same situation enabled exchange great quantity own goods great quantity comes same thing price great quantity theirs
supplies them abundantly occasion accommodate amply occasion general plenty diffuses itself through different ranks society

therefore outputs period1 used usable input period2 regarded unproductive labour contribute growth
smith heard france among others quesnay
french insight unproductive labour should pushed back use labour productively smith added own proposal productive labour should made even productive deepening division labour
smith argued deepening division labour under competition leads greater productivity leads lower prices thus increasing standard living—general plenty universal opulence—for
extended markets increased production lead continuous reorganisation production inventing new ways producing lead further increased production lower prices increased standards living
