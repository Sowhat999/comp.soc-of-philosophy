despite controversy da tongshu still remains popular
beijing publisher included list 100 most influential books chinese history
worth noting source controversy surrounding da tongshu inescapably racist attitude author takes eugenic diatribe against world's colored peoples
philosophical views kang enumerated sources human suffering way similar buddhism
sufferings associated man's physical life being implanted womb premature death loss limb being barbarian living outside china being slave being woman
sufferings associated natural disasters famine resulting flood drought epidemic conflagration flood volcanic eruptions collapse buildings shipwreck locust plagues
