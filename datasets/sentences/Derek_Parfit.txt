august 2009 reasons persons four-part work each successive section building last
parfit believes nonreligious ethics young fertile field inquiry
asks questions actions right wrong shies away meta-ethics focuses logic language
part reasons persons parfit discusses self-defeating theories namely self-interest theory rationality s two ethical frameworks common sense morality csm consequentialism c
posits s dominant western culture over two millennia often making bedfellows religious doctrine united self-interest morality
because s demands make self-interest our supreme rational concern instructs us ensure our whole life goes well possible s makes temporally neutral requirements
thus irrational act ways know prefer later undo
example irrational 14-year-old listen loud music get arrested vandalism knows such actions will detract significantly future well-being goals such academic career philosophy having good hearing
most notably self-interest theory holds irrational commit any acts self-denial act desires negatively affect our well-being
may consider aspiring author whose strongest desire write award-winning novel doing suffers lack sleep depression
parfit holds plausible such desires outside our own well-being irrational act fulfill these desires
aside initial appeal plausibility desires directly contribute one's life going well parfit contrives situations s indirectly self-defeating
makes demands initially posits irrational
does fail own terms does recommend adoption alternative framework rationality
instance might my self-interest become trustworthy participate mutually beneficial agreements even though maintaining agreement will doing will ceteris paribus worse me
many cases s instructs us precisely follow s {section 63 chapter reasons persons} thus fitting definition indirectly self-defeating theory
parfit contends indirectly individually self-defeating directly collectively self-defeating fatally damaging s
further bury s parfit exploits partial relativity juxtaposing temporally neutral demands against agent-centered demands
appeal full relativity raises question whether theory consistently neutral sphere actualisation entirely partial another
stripped commonly accepted shrouds plausibility shown inconsistent s judged own lacking merits
while parfit cannot offer argument dismiss s outright exposition lays s bare allows own failings show through
[citation needed] defensible defender must bite many bullets might lose their credibility process
thus need search new theory rationality
parfit offers critical present aim theory cp broad catch-all formulated accommodate any competing theory
parfit constructs cp exclude self-interest our over-riding rational concern allow time action become critically important
leaves question open however whether should include avoid acting wrongly our highest concern
such inclusion pave way ethics
henry sidgwick longed fusion ethics rationality while parfit admits many ardently avoid acting irrationally opposed immorally cannot construct argument adequately unites two
s self-defeating theory
s puts too much emphasis separateness persons c fails recognise importance bonds emotional responses come allowing people privileged positions one's life
pure do-gooders perhaps following sidgwick constitute outcome maximise happiness
better small percentage population pure do-gooders others acted out love etc
thus c too makes demands agents initially deemed immoral fails own terms still demands outcome maximises total happiness does demand each agent act impartial happiness promoter
c thus needs revised well
s c fail indirectly while csm directly collectively self-defeating
s s individual theory
parfit shows using interesting examples borrowing nashian games often better us put welfare our loved ones before else
example should care our kids everyone's kids
parfit often poses questions answers
ethics points need dynamic framework combines csm c offers no specific solution
such attitude tracks stance nonreligious ethics young fertile field
personal identity parfit singular meticulously rigorous almost mathematical investigations personal identity
cases parfit uses many examples seemingly inspired star trek other science fiction such teletransporter explore our intuitions our identity
reductionist believing since there no adequate criterion personal identity people exist apart their components
parfit argues reality fully described impersonally there need determinate answer question will continue exist? know facts person's continued existence able say whether person survived
concludes mistaken assuming personal identity matters survival matters rather relation r psychological connectedness namely memory character continuity overlapping chains strong connectedness
parfit's account individuals nothing brains bodies identity cannot reduced either
parfit concedes theories rarely conflict rival reductionist theories everyday life two brought blows introduction extraordinary examples defends use such examples grounds arouse strong intuitions many us
identity determinate often suppose instead such determinacy arises mainly way talk
people exist same way nations clubs exist
key parfitian question given choice surviving without psychological continuity connectedness relation r dying preserving r through someone else's future existence you choose? parfit argues latter preferable
parfit describes loss belief separate self liberating my life seemed like glass tunnel through moving faster every year end there darkness
[however] changed my view walls my glass tunnel disappeared
now live open air
there still difference my life lives other people
difference less
other people closer
am less concerned rest my own life concerned lives others
criticism personal identity view fellow reductionist mark johnston princeton rejects parfit's constitutive notion identity calls argument above
johnston maintains even lower-level facts [that make up identity] themselves matter higher-level fact may matter
does lower-level facts will derived significance
will matter themselves because constitute higher level fact
johnston moves preserve significance personhood
parfit's explanation personhood itself matters rather facts personhood consists provide significance
illustrate difference himself johnston parfit makes use example brain-damaged patient becomes irreversibly unconscious
patient certainly still alive even though fact separate fact heart still beating other organs still functioning
fact patient alive independent separately obtaining fact
patient's being alive even though irreversibly unconscious simply consists other facts
parfit explains so-called argument below arbitrate value heart other organs still working without having assign them derived significance johnston's perspective dictate

find sources derek parfit news · newspapers · books · scholar · jstor · free images april 2011 parfit's most famous postulations come part iv reasons persons discusses possible futures world
shows discussion possible futures both average total utilitarian standards lead unwelcome conclusions
applying total utilitarian standards absolute total happiness possible growth paths population welfare leads calls repugnant conclusion
parfit illustrates simple thought experiment
imagine choice possible futures
10 billion people live during next generation extremely happy lives lives far happier anyone's today
there 20 billion people living lives while slightly less happy those still very happy
under total utility maximisation should prefer through regressive process population increases happiness decreases each pair cases happiness decrease outweighed population increase forced prefer z world hundreds billions people living lives barely worth living compared
even hold coming exist benefit someone still must least admit z no worse
parfit makes similar argument against average utilitarian standards
care average happiness forced conclude extremely small population say ten people over course human history best outcome assume these ten people adam eve et al
lives happier ever imagine
then consider case american immigration
presumably alien welfare less american would-be alien benefits tremendously leaving homeland
assume also americans benefit immigration least small amounts because get cheap labour etc
under immigration both groups better off increase offset increase population then average welfare lower
thus although everyone better off preferred outcome
parfit asserts simply absurd
parfit then moves discuss identity future generations
first posits one's existence intimately related time conditions conception
me my parents waited two years child
while still child certainly someone else even still their first-born son me
study weather patterns other physical phenomena 20 th century shown very minor changes conditions time t drastic effects times after t
compare romantic involvement future childbearing partners
any actions taken today time t will affect exists after few generations
instance significant change global environmental policy shift conditions conception process much after 300 years none same people born fact born
different couples meet each other conceive different times different people come existence
known 'non-identity problem'
thus craft disastrous policies worse nobody because none same people exist under different policies
consider moral ramifications potential policies person-affecting terms will no reason prefer sound policy over unsound provided effects felt few generations
non-identity problem purest form identity future generations causally dependent very sensitive way actions present generations
