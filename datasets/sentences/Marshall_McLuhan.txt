mc luhan chose ads articles included book draw attention their symbolism their implications corporate entities created disseminated them also mull over such advertising implies wider society aimed
gutenberg galaxy 1962 mc luhan's gutenberg galaxy making typographic man written 1961 first published canada university toronto press 1962 pioneering study fields oral culture print culture cultural studies media ecology
throughout book mc luhan takes pains reveal how communication technology alphabetic writing printing press electronic media affects cognitive organization turn profound ramifications social organization
[i]f new technology extends our senses outside us social world then new ratios among our senses will occur particular culture
comparable happens new note added melody
sense ratios alter any culture then appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque vague opaque will become translucent
movable type episodic history takes reader pre-alphabetic tribal humankind electronic age
according mc luhan invention movable type greatly accelerated intensified ultimately enabled cultural cognitive changes already taking place since invention implementation alphabet mc luhan means phonemic orthography
mc luhan careful distinguish phonetic alphabet logographic/logogramic writing systems like hieroglyphics ideograms
print culture ushered gutenberg press middle fifteenth century brought cultural predominance visual over aural/oral
quoting approval observation nature printed word prints visual communication william ivins mc luhan remarks passage [ivins] notes ingraining lineal sequential habits even important points out visual homogenizing experience print culture relegation auditory other sensuous complexity background
technology social effects typography incline us abstain noting interplay formal causality both our inner external lives
print exists virtue static separation functions fosters mentality gradually resists any separative compartmentalizing specialist outlook
main concept mc luhan's argument later elaborated upon medium massage new technologies like alphabets printing presses even speech itself exert gravitational effect cognition turn affects social organization print technology changes our perceptual habits visual homogenizing experience turn affects social interactions fosters mentality gradually resists
specialist outlook
according mc luhan advent print technology contributed made possible most salient trends modern period western world individualism democracy protestantism capitalism nationalism
mc luhan these trends reverberate print technology's principle segmentation actions functions principle visual quantification
global village early 1960 s mc luhan visual individualistic print culture soon brought end called electronic interdependence electronic media replace visual culture aural/oral culture
new age humankind will move individualism fragmentation collective identity tribal base
mc luhan's coinage new social organization global village
term sometimes described having negative connotations gutenberg galaxy mc luhan himself interested exploring effects making value judgments instead tending towards vast alexandrian library world become computer electronic brain exactly infantile piece science fiction
our senses gone outside us big brother goes inside
unless aware dynamic shall once move phase panic terrors exactly befitting small world tribal drums total interdependence superimposed co-existence
terror normal state any oral society everything affects everything time
our long striving recover western world unity sensibility thought feeling no prepared accept tribal consequences such unity ready fragmentation human psyche print culture
key mc luhan's argument idea technology no per se moral bent—it tool profoundly shapes individual's extension society's self-conception realization obvious there enough moral problems without also taking moral stand technological grounds? [
print extreme phase alphabet culture detribalizes decollectivizes man first instance
print raises visual features alphabet highest intensity definition
thus print carries individuating power phonetic alphabet much further manuscript culture ever
print technology individualism
men decided modify visual technology electric technology individualism also modified
raise moral complaint like cussing buzz-saw lopping off fingers
someone says didn't know happen
yet even witlessness moral issue
problem moral problem nice clear away moral fogs surround our technologies
good morality
moral valence technology's effects cognition mc luhan matter perspective
instance mc luhan contrasts considerable alarm revulsion growing quantity books aroused latter seventeenth century modern concern end book
there no universal moral sentence passed technology mc luhan believes there disaster arising unawareness causalities effects inherent our technologies
though world wide web invented almost thirty years after gutenberg galaxy ten years after death mc luhan prophesied web technology seen today early 1962 next medium whatever is—it may extension consciousness—will include television content environment will transform television art form
computer research communication instrument enhance retrieval obsolesce mass library organization retrieve individual's encyclopedic function flip private line speedily tailored data saleable kind
1962 furthermore mc luhan coined certainly popularized usage term surfing refer rapid irregular multidirectional movement through heterogeneous body documents knowledge e
statements like heidegger surf-boards along electronic wave triumphantly descartes rode mechanical wave
paul levinson's 1999 book digital mc luhan explores ways mc luhan's work better understood through lens digital revolution
mc luhan frequently quoted walter ong's ramus method decay dialogue 1958 evidently prompted mc luhan write gutenberg galaxy
ong highly favorable review new book america
however ong later tempered praise describing mc luhan's gutenberg galaxy racy survey indifferent scholarly detail uniquely valuable suggesting sweep depth cultural psychological changes entailed passage illiteracy print beyond
mc luhan himself book i'm concerned get any kudos out [the gutenberg galaxy]
seems me book somebody should written century ago
wish somebody else written
will useful prelude rewrite understanding media [the 1960 naeb report] i'm doing now
[citation needed] mc luhan's gutenberg galaxy won canada's highest literary award governor-general's award non-fiction 1962
chairman selection committee mc luhan's colleague university toronto oftentime intellectual sparring partner northrop frye
understanding media 1964 mc luhan's most widely known work understanding media extensions man 1964 pioneering study media theory
dismayed way people approached used new media such television mc luhan famously argued modern world live mythically integrally
continue think old fragmented space time patterns pre-electric age
mc luhan proposed media themselves content carry should focus study—popularly quoted medium message
mc luhan's insight medium affects society plays role content delivered over medium characteristics medium itself
mc luhan pointed light bulb clear demonstration concept
light bulb does content way newspaper articles television programs yet medium social effect light bulb enables people create spaces during nighttime otherwise enveloped darkness
describes light bulb medium without any content
mc luhan states light bulb creates environment mere presence
controversially postulated content little effect society—in other words matter television broadcasts children's shows violent programming illustrate example—the effect television society identical
noted media characteristics engage viewer different ways instance passage book reread will movie screened again entirety study any individual part
hot cool media first part understanding media mc luhan also stated different media invite different degrees participation part person chooses consume medium
media like movies hot—that enhance single sense case vision such manner person does need exert much effort filling details movie image
mc luhan contrasted cool tv claimed requires effort part viewer determine meaning comics due their minimal presentation visual detail require high degree effort fill details cartoonist may intended portray
movie thus mc luhan hot intensifying single sense high definition demanding viewer's attention comic book cool low definition requiring much conscious participation reader extract value
any hot medium allows less participation cool lecture makes less participation seminar book less dialogue
hot media usually provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus
example print occupies visual space uses visual senses immerse reader
hot media favour analytical precision quantitative analysis sequential ordering usually sequential linear logical
emphasize sense example sight sound over others
reason hot media also include radio well film lecture photography
cool media other hand usually those provide little involvement substantial stimulus
require active participation part user including perception abstract patterning simultaneous comprehension parts
therefore according mc luhan cool media include television well seminar cartoons
mc luhan describes term cool media emerging jazz popular music context used mean detached
concept appears force media binary categories
however mc luhan's hot cool exist continuum correctly measured scale dichotomous terms
critiques understanding media theorists attacked mc luhan’s definition treatment word medium being too simplistic
umberto eco instance contends mc luhan’s medium conflates channels codes messages under overarching term medium confusing vehicle internal code content given message framework
media manifestos régis debray also takes issue mc luhan’s envisioning medium
like eco too ill ease reductionist approach summarizing ramifications follows list objections lengthened indefinitely confusing technology itself use media makes media abstract undifferentiated force produces image imaginary public mass consumption magical naivete supposed causalities turns media catch-all contagious mana apocalyptic millenarianism invents figure homo mass-mediaticus without ties historical social context
furthermore wired interviewed 1995 debray stated views mc luhan poet historian master intellectual collage rather systematic analyst
mc luhan overemphasizes technology behind cultural change expense usage messages codes make technology
dwight macdonald turn reproached mc luhan focus television aphoristic style prose believes left understanding media filled contradictions non-sequiturs facts distorted facts facts exaggerations chronic rhetorical vagueness
additionally brian winston’s misunderstanding media published 1986 chides mc luhan sees technologically deterministic stances
raymond williams james w
carey further point contention claiming work mc luhan particular culmination aesthetic theory became negatively social theory [
apparently sophisticated technological determinism significant effect indicating social cultural determinism [
medium - whether print television cause other causes men ordinarily see history once reduced effects
williams 1990 126/7 david carr states there long line academics made career out deconstructing mc luhan’s effort define modern media ecosystem whether due see mc luhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context style argument
while critics taken issue mc luhan’s writing style mode argument mc luhan himself urged readers think work probes mosaics offering toolkit approach thinking media
eclectic writing style also praised postmodern sensibilities suitability virtual space
medium massage inventory effects 1967 medium massage published 1967 mc luhan's best seller eventually selling nearly million copies worldwide
initiated quentin fiore mc luhan adopted term massage denote effect each medium human sensorium taking inventory effects numerous media terms how massage sensorium
fiore time prominent graphic designer communications consultant set composing visual illustration these effects compiled jerome agel
near beginning book fiore adopted pattern image demonstrating media effect presented textual synopsis facing page
reader experiences repeated shifting analytic registers—from reading typographic print scanning photographic facsimiles—reinforcing mc luhan's overarching argument book namely each medium produces different massage effect human sensorium
medium massage mc luhan also rehashed argument—which first appeared prologue 1962's gutenberg galaxy—that media extensions our human senses bodies minds
finally mc luhan described key points change how man viewed world how these views changed adoption new media
technique invention discovery nineteenth [century] brought adoption fixed points view perspective typography while [t]he technique suspended judgment discovery twentieth century brought bard abilities radio movies television
past went that-a-way
faced totally new situation tend attach ourselves objects flavor most recent past
look present through rear-view mirror

mc luhan biographer philip marchand called recording 1967 equivalent mc luhan video
wouldn't seen dead living work art
—'old man' speaking drop jiggery-pokery talk straight turkey
—'middle aged man' speaking war peace global village 1968 mc luhan used james joyce's finnegans wake inspiration study war throughout history indicator how war may conducted future
joyce's wake claimed gigantic cryptogram reveals cyclic pattern whole history man through ten thunders
each thunder below 100-character portmanteau other words create statement likens effect each technology society introduced

cliché archetype 1970 1970 book cliché archetype mc luhan collaborating canadian poet wilfred watson approached various implications verbal cliché archetype
major facet mc luhan's overall framework introduced book seldom noticed provision new term actually succeeds global village global theater
mc luhan's terms cliché normal action phrase etc
becomes often used anesthetized effects
example given mc luhan eugène ionesco's play bald soprano whose dialogue consists entirely phrases ionesco pulled assimil language book
ionesco originally put these idiomatic english clichés literary french presented english most absurd aspect possible
mc luhan's archetype quoted extension medium technology environment
environment also include kinds awareness cognitive shifts brought upon people totally unlike psychological context carl jung described
mc luhan also posits there factor interplay cliché archetype doubleness another theme wake [finnegans wake] helps understanding paradoxical shift cliché archetype 'past time pastimes
dominant technologies age become games pastimes later age
20 th century number 'past times' simultaneously available vast create cultural anarchy
cultures world simultaneously present work artist elucidation form takes new scope new urgency
most men pushed artist's role
artist cannot dispense principle 'doubleness' 'interplay' because type hendiadys dialogue essential very structure consciousness awareness autonomy
mc luhan relates cliché-to-archetype process theater absurd pascal seventeenth century tells us heart many reasons head knows nothing
theater absurd essentially communicating head silent languages heart two three hundred years tried forget
seventeenth century world languages heart pushed down unconscious dominant print cliché
languages heart mc luhan otherwise define oral culture thus made archetype means printing press turned cliché
satellite medium mc luhan states encloses earth man-made environment ends 'nature' turns globe repertory theater programmed
previous environments book newspaper radio etc
their artifacts retrieved under these conditions past times pastimes
mc luhan thereby meshes term global theater
serves update older concept global village own definitions subsumed overall condition described global theater
global village transformations world life media 21 st century 1989 1989 posthumous book global village mc luhan collaborating bruce r
powers provided strong conceptual framework understanding cultural implications technological advances associated rise worldwide electronic network
major work mc luhan's because contains most extensive elaboration concept acoustic space provides critique standard 20 th century communication models like shannon–weaver model
mc luhan distinguishes existing worldview visual space - linear quantitative classically geometric model - acoustic space - holistic qualitative order complex intricate paradoxical topology
acoustic space basic character sphere whose focus center simultaneously everywhere whose margin nowhere
transition visual acoustic space automatic advent global network conscious project
universal environment simultaneous electronic flow inherently favors right-brain acoustic space yet held back habits adhering fixed point view
there no boundaries sound
hear directions once
yet acoustic visual space fact inseparable
resonant interval invisible borderline visual acoustic space
like television camera apollo astronauts focused earth after orbited moon
reading writing hierarchical ordering associated left brain linear concept time phonetic literacy
left brain locus analysis classification rationality
right brain locus spatial tactile musical
comprehensive awareness results two sides brain true balance
visual space associated simplified worldview euclidean geometry intuitive three dimensions useful architecture buildings surveying land
too rational no grasp acoustic
acoustic space multisensory
mc luhan writes robotism context japanese zen buddhism how offer us new ways thinking technology
western way thinking technology too much related left hemisphere our brain rational linear focus
called robotism might better called androidism wake blade runner novels philip k
robotism-androidism emerges further development right hemisphere brain creativity new relationship spacetime most humans still living 17 th century classical newtonian physics spacetime
robots-androids will much greater flexibility humans until now both mind body
robots-androids will teach humanity new flexibility
flexibility androids mc luhan calls robotism strong affinity japanese culture life
mc luhan quotes ruth benedict chrysanthemum sword anthropological study japanese culture published 1946 “occidentals cannot easily credit ability japanese swing behavior another without psychic cost
such extreme possibilities included our experience
yet japanese life contradictions seem us deeply based their view life our uniformities ours
ability live present instantly readjust
beyond existing communication models western scientific models communication are—like shannon–weaver model—linear sequential logical reflection late medieval emphasis greek notion efficient causality
mc luhan powers criticize shannon-weaver model communication emblematic left-hemisphere bias linearity descended aristotelean causality
third term global village mc luhan powers develop length tetrad
tetrad something like threads complexly interwoven flowing superspace four-fold pattern transformation
full maturity tetrad reveals metaphoric structure artifact having two figures two grounds dynamic analogical relationship each other
like camera focused earth apollo astronauts tetrad reveals figure moon ground earth simultaneously
right-brain hemisphere thinking capability being many places same time
electricity acoustic
simultaneously everywhere
tetrad fourfold möbius topological structure enhancement reversal retrieval obsolescence mobilized mc luhan powers illuminate media technological inventions cash money compass computer database satellite global media network
key concepts tetrad main article tetrad media effects laws media 1988 published posthumously son eric mc luhan summarized ideas media concise tetrad media effects
tetrad means examining effects society any technology
any medium dividing effects four categories displaying them simultaneously
mc luhan designed tetrad pedagogical tool phrasing laws questions consider any medium does medium enhance? does medium make obsolete? does medium retrieve obsolesced earlier? does medium flip pushed extremes? laws tetrad exist simultaneously successively chronologically allow questioner explore grammar syntax language media
mc luhan departs mentor harold innis suggesting medium overheats reverses opposing form taken extreme
visually tetrad depicted four diamonds forming x name medium centre
two diamonds left tetrad enhancement retrieval qualities medium both figure qualities
two diamonds right tetrad obsolescence reversal qualities both ground qualities
blank tetrad diagram using example radio enhancement figure medium amplifies intensifies
radio amplifies news music via sound
obsolescence ground medium drives out prominence
radio reduces importance print visual
retrieval figure medium recovers previously lost
radio returns spoken word forefront
reversal ground medium does pushed limits
acoustic radio flips audio-visual tv
figure ground main article figure ground media mc luhan adapted gestalt psychology idea figure ground underpins meaning medium message
used concept explain how form communications technology medium figure necessarily operates through context ground
mc luhan believed order grasp fully effect new technology must examine figure medium ground context together since neither completely intelligible without other
mc luhan argued must study media their historical context particularly relation technologies preceded them
present environment itself made up effects previous technologies gives rise new technologies their turn further affect society individuals
technologies embedded within them their own assumptions time space
message medium conveys understood medium environment medium used—and simultaneously effectively creates—are analysed together
believed examination figure-ground relationship offer critical commentary culture society
