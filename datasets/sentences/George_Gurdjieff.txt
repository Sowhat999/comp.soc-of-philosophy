ideas gurdjieff claimed people cannot perceive reality their current states because possess unified consciousness rather live state hypnotic waking sleep
man lives life sleep sleep dies
result condition each person perceives things completely subjective perspective
asserted people their typical state function unconscious automatons person wake up become different sort human being altogether
self-development teachings main article fourth way gurdjieff argued many existing forms religious spiritual tradition earth lost connection their original meaning vitality no longer serve humanity way intended their inception
result humans failing realize truths ancient teachings instead becoming like automatons susceptible control outside increasingly capable otherwise unthinkable acts mass psychosis such world war
best various surviving sects schools provide one-sided development result fully integrated human being
according gurdjieff dimension three dimensions person—namely either emotions physical body mind—tends develop such schools sects generally expense other faculties centers gurdjieff called them
result these paths fail produce properly balanced human being
furthermore anyone wishing undertake any traditional paths spiritual knowledge gurdjieff reduced three—namely path fakir path monk path yogi required renounce life world
gurdjieff thus developed fourth way amenable requirements modern people living modern lives europe america
instead developing body mind emotions separately gurdjieff's discipline worked three promote comprehensive balanced inner development
parallel other spiritual traditions gurdjieff taught person must expend considerable effort effect transformation leads awakening
effort put practice gurdjieff referred work work oneself
according gurdjieff
working oneself difficult wishing work taking decision
though gurdjieff never put major significance term fourth way never used term writings pupil p
ouspensky 1924 1947 made term use central own teaching gurdjieff's ideas
after ouspensky's death students published book titled fourth way based lectures
gurdjieff's teaching addressed question humanity's place universe importance developing latent potentialities—regarded our natural endowment human beings rarely brought fruition
taught higher levels consciousness higher bodies inner growth development real possibilities nonetheless require conscious work achieve
teaching gurdjieff gave distinct meaning various ancient texts such bible many religious prayers
claimed those texts possess very different meaning commonly attributed them
sleep awake you know hour kingdom heaven within examples biblical statements point psychological teaching whose essence forgotten
gurdjieff taught people how increase focus their attention energy various ways minimize daydreaming absentmindedness
according teaching inner development oneself beginning possible further process change aim transform people gurdjieff believed ought
distrusting morality describes varying culture culture often contradictory hypocritical gurdjieff greatly stressed importance conscience
provide conditions inner attention exercised intensively gurdjieff also taught pupils sacred dances movements later known gurdjieff movements performed together group
also left body music inspired heard visits remote monasteries other places written piano collaboration pupils thomas de hartmann
gurdjieff also used various exercises such stop exercise prompt self-observation students
other shocks help awaken pupils constant daydreaming possible any moment
methods work essence training development consciousness
gurdjieff used number different methods materials including meetings music movements sacred dance writings lectures innovative forms group individual work
part function these various methods undermine undo ingrained habit patterns mind bring moments insight
since each individual different requirements gurdjieff one-size-fits-all approach adapted innovated circumstance required
russia described keeping teaching confined small circle whereas paris north america gave numerous public demonstrations
gurdjieff felt traditional methods self-knowledge—those fakir monk yogi acquired respectively through pain devotion study—were inadequate their own often led various forms stagnation one-sidedness
methods designed augment traditional paths purpose hastening developmental process
sometimes called these methods way sly man because constituted sort short-cut through process development might otherwise carry years without substantive results
teacher possessing consciousness sees individual requirements disciple sets tasks knows will result transformation consciousness individual
instructive historical parallels found annals zen buddhism teachers employed variety methods sometimes highly unorthodox bring arising insight student
music gurdjieff's music divides three distinct periods
first period early music including music ballet struggle magicians music early movements dating years around 1918
