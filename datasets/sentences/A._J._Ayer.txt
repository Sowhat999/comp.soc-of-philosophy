mace's opinion metaphysics form intellectual poetry
stance person believes god denotes no verifiable hypothesis sometimes referred igtheism example paul kurtz

followed footsteps bertrand russell debating jesuit scholar frederick copleston topic religion
ayer's version emotivism divides ordinary system ethics four classes propositions express definitions ethical terms judgements legitimacy possibility certain definitions propositions describing phenomena moral experience their causes exhortations moral virtue actual ethical judgments focuses propositions first class—moral judgments—saying those second class belong science those third mere commands those fourth considered normative ethics opposed meta-ethics too concrete ethical philosophy
while class three statements irrelevant ayer's brand emotivism later play significant role stevenson's
ayer argues moral judgments cannot translated non-ethical empirical terms thus cannot verified agrees ethical intuitionists
differs intuitionists discarding appeals intuition non-empirical moral truths worthless since intuition person often contradicts another
instead ayer concludes ethical concepts mere pseudo-concepts presence ethical symbol proposition adds nothing factual content
thus say someone you acted wrongly stealing money am stating anything simply you stole money
adding action wrong am making any further statement
am simply evincing my moral disapproval
you stole money peculiar tone horror written addition special exclamation marks
… now generalise my previous statement say stealing money wrong produce sentence no factual meaning—that expresses no proposition either true false
… am merely expressing certain moral sentiments
