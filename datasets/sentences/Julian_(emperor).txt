constantius ii constans constantine ii proclaimed joint emperors each ruling portion roman territory
julian gallus excluded public life strictly guarded their youth given christian education

constantine ii died 340 attacked brother constans

354 gallus imposed rule terror over territories under command executed
julian summoned court held year under suspicion treasonable intrigue first brother then claudius silvanus cleared part because empress eusebia intervened behalf sent athens
julian expresses gratitude empress eusebia third oration
caesar gaul after dealing rebellions magnentius sylvanus constantius felt needed permanent representative gaul
355 julian summoned appear before emperor mediolanum 6 november made caesar west marrying constantius' sister helena
constantius after experience gallus intended representative figurehead active participant events packed julian off gaul small retinue constantius' prefects gaul keep check
first reluctant trade scholarly life war politics eventually took every opportunity involve himself affairs gaul
following years julian learned how lead then run army through series campaigns against germanic tribes settled both sides rhine
campaigns against germanic kingdoms julian military dress
despite having received no military education julian proved able military commander obtaining important victory gaul leading roman army under walls sassanid empire's capital
356 during first campaign led army rhine engaged inhabitants there won back several towns fallen frankish hands including colonia agrippina cologne
success under belt withdrew winter gaul distributing forces protect various towns choosing small town senon near verdun await spring
turned out tactical error left insufficient forces defend himself large contingent franks besieged town julian virtually held captive there several months until general marcellus deigned lift siege
relations julian marcellus seem poor
constantius accepted julian's report events marcellus replaced magister equitum severus
following year saw combined operation planned constantius regain control rhine germanic peoples spilt across river onto west bank
south magister peditum barbatio come milan amass forces augst near rhine bend then set off north 25000 soldiers julian 13000 troops move east durocortorum rheims
however while julian transit group laeti attacked lugdunum lyon julian delayed order deal them
left barbatio unsupported deep alamanni territory felt obliged withdraw retracing steps
thus ended coordinated operation against germanic peoples
barbatio safely out picture king chnodomarius led confederation alamanni forces against julian severus battle argentoratum
romans heavily outnumbered during heat battle group 600 horsemen right wing deserted yet taking full advantage limitations terrain romans overwhelmingly victorious
enemy routed driven river
king chnodomarius captured later sent constantius milan
ammianus participant battle portrays julian charge events battlefield describes how soldiers because success acclaimed julian attempting make augustus acclamation rejected rebuking them
later rewarded them their valor
rather chase routed enemy across rhine julian now proceeded follow rhine north route followed previous year way back gaul
moguntiacum mainz however crossed rhine expedition penetrated deep today germany forced three local kingdoms submit
action showed alamanni rome once again present active area
way back winter quarters paris dealt band franks taken control abandoned forts along meuse river
358 julian gained victories over salian franks lower rhine settling them toxandria roman empire north today's city tongeren over chamavi expelled back hamaland
taxation administration end 357 julian prestige victory over alamanni give confidence prevented tax increase gallic praetorian prefect florentius personally took charge province belgica secunda
julian's first experience civil administration views influenced liberal education greece
properly role belonged praetorian prefect
however florentius julian often clashed over administration gaul
julian's first priority caesar nominal ranking commander gaul drive out barbarians breached rhine frontier
however sought win over support civil population necessary operations gaul also show largely germanic army benefits imperial rule
therefore felt necessary rebuild stable peaceful conditions devastated cities countryside
reason julian clashed florentius over latter's support tax increases mentioned above florentius's own corruption bureaucracy
constantius attempted maintain modicum control over caesar explains removal julian's close adviser saturninius secundus salutius gaul
departure stimulated writing julian's oration consolation upon departure salutius
rebellion paris 19 th century depiction julian being proclaimed emperor paris thermes de cluny standing shield frankish manner february 360
fourth year julian's stay gaul sassanid emperor shapur ii invaded mesopotamia took city amida after 73-day siege
february 360 constantius ii ordered half julian's gallic troops eastern army order by-passing julian going directly military commanders
although julian first attempted expedite order provoked insurrection troops petulantes no desire leave gaul
according historian zosimus army officers those responsible distributing anonymous tract expressing complaints against constantius well fearing julian's ultimate fate
notably absent time prefect florentius usually never far julian's side though now kept busy organizing supplies vienne away any strife order cause
julian later blame arrival order constantius
ammianus marcellinus even suggested fear julian gaining popularity himself caused constantius send order urging florentius
troops proclaimed julian augustus paris turn led very swift military effort secure win allegiance others
although full details unclear there evidence suggest julian may least partially stimulated insurrection
went back business usual gaul june august year julian led successful campaign against attuarian franks
november julian began openly using title augustus even issuing coins title sometimes constantius sometimes without
celebrated fifth year gaul big show games
spring 361 julian led army territory alamanni captured their king vadomarius
julian claimed vadomarius league constantius encouraging raid borders raetia
julian then divided forces sending column raetia northern italy third led down danube boats
forces claimed control illyricum general nevitta secured pass succi thrace
now well out comfort zone road civil war
julian state late november set off down road because having declared public enemy meant frighten [constantius] merely our quarrel should result intercourse friendly terms
however june forces loyal constantius captured city aquileia north adriatic coast event threatened cut julian off rest forces while constantius's troops marched towards east

new emperor administration church holy apostles julian brought constantius ii buried
december 361 julian entered constantinople sole emperor despite rejection christianity first political act preside over constantius' christian burial escorting body church apostles placed alongside constantine
act demonstration lawful right throne
also now thought responsible building santa costanza christian site just outside rome mausoleum wife helena sister-in-law constantina
new emperor rejected style administration immediate predecessors
blamed constantine state administration having abandoned traditions past
made no attempt restore tetrarchal system begun under diocletian
nor seek rule absolute autocrat
own philosophic notions led idealize reigns hadrian marcus aurelius
first panegyric constantius julian described ideal ruler being essentially primus inter pares first among equals operating under same laws subjects
while constantinople therefore strange see julian frequently active senate participating debates making speeches placing himself level other members senate
viewed royal court predecessors inefficient corrupt expensive
thousands servants eunuchs superfluous officials therefore summarily dismissed
set up chalcedon tribunal deal corruption previous administration under supervision magister militum arbitio
several high-ranking officials under constantius including chamberlain eusebius found guilty executed
julian conspicuously absent proceedings perhaps signaling displeasure their necessity
continually sought reduce saw burdensome corrupt bureaucracy within imperial administration whether involved civic officials secret agents imperial post service
another effect julian's political philosophy authority cities expanded expense imperial bureaucracy julian sought reduce direct imperial involvement urban affairs
example city land owned imperial government returned cities city council members compelled resume civic authority often against their will tribute gold cities called aurum coronarium made voluntary rather compulsory tax
additionally arrears land taxes cancelled
key reform reducing power corrupt imperial officials unpaid taxes land often hard calculate higher value land itself
forgiving back taxes both made julian popular allowed increase collections current taxes
while ceded much authority imperial government cities julian also took direct control himself
example new taxes corvées approved directly rather left judgement bureaucratic apparatus
julian certainly clear idea wanted roman society both political well religious terms
terrible violent dislocation 3 rd century meant eastern mediterranean become economic locus empire
cities treated relatively autonomous local administrative areas simplify problems imperial administration far julian concerned should focused administration law defense empire's vast frontiers
replacing constantius's political civil appointees julian drew heavily intellectual professional classes kept reliable holdovers such rhetorician themistius
choice consuls year 362 controversial
very acceptable claudius mamertinus previously praetorian prefect illyricum
other surprising choice nevitta julian's trusted frankish general
latter appointment made overt fact emperor's authority depended power army
julian's choice nevitta appears aimed maintaining support western army acclaimed
clash antiochenes after five months dealings capital julian left constantinople may moved antioch arriving mid-july staying there nine months before launching fateful campaign against persia march 363
antioch city favored splendid temples along famous oracle apollo nearby daphne may cause choosing reside there
also used past staging place amassing troops purpose julian intended follow
arrival 18 july well received antiochenes though coincided celebration adonia festival marked death adonis there wailing moaning streets—not good omen arrival
julian soon discovered wealthy merchants causing food problems apparently hoarding food selling high prices
hoped curia deal issue situation headed famine
curia nothing spoke city's leading citizens trying persuade them take action
thinking job turned attention religious matters
tried resurrect ancient oracular spring castalia temple apollo daphne
after being advised bones 3 rd-century bishop babylas suppressing god made public-relations mistake ordering removal bones vicinity temple
result massive christian procession
shortly after temple destroyed fire julian suspected christians ordered stricter investigations usual
also shut up chief christian church city before investigations proved fire result accident
curia still took no substantial action regards food shortage julian intervened fixing prices grain importing egypt
then landholders refused sell theirs claiming harvest bad compensated fair prices
julian accused them price gouging forced them sell
various parts libanius' orations may suggest both sides justified extent while ammianus blames julian mere thirst popularity
julian's ascetic lifestyle popular either since subjects accustomed idea all-powerful emperor placed himself well above them
nor improve dignity own participation ceremonial bloody sacrifices
david s
potter says expected man both removed them awesome spectacle imperial power validate their interests desires sharing them olympian height
supposed interested interested people supposed dignified
supposed leap up show appreciation panegyric delivered julian done january 3 libanius speaking ignore chariot races
then tried address public criticism mocking issuing satire ostensibly himself called misopogon beard hater
there blames people antioch preferring their ruler virtues face rather soul
even julian's intellectual friends fellow pagans divided mind habit talking subjects equal footing ammianus marcellinus saw foolish vanity someone excessively anxious empty distinction whose desire popularity often led converse unworthy persons
leaving antioch appointed alexander heliopolis governor violent cruel man whom antiochene libanius friend emperor admits first thought dishonourable appointment
julian himself described man undeserving position appropriate avaricious rebellious people antioch
persian campaign vte julian's persian war siege pirisabora battle ctesiphon battle maranga battle samarra julian's rise augustus result military insurrection eased constantius's sudden death
meant while count wholehearted support western army aided rise eastern army unknown quantity originally loyal emperor risen against tried woo through chalcedon tribunal
however solidify position eyes eastern army needed lead soldiers victory campaign against sassanid persians offered such opportunity
audacious plan formulated whose goal lay siege sassanid capital city ctesiphon definitively secure eastern border
yet full motivation ambitious operation best unclear
there no direct necessity invasion sassanids sent envoys hope settling matters peacefully
julian rejected offer
ammianus states julian longed revenge persians certain desire combat glory also played role decision go war
illustration fall princes john lydgate translation de casibus virorum illustribus giovanni boccaccio depicting skyn julyan
there no evidence julian's corpse skinned displayed likely illustrator simply confused fate julian's body emperor valerian
enemy territory 5 march 363 despite series omens against campaign julian departed antioch 65000–83000 80000–90000 men headed north toward euphrates
en route met embassies various small powers offering assistance none accepted
order armenian king arsaces muster army await instructions
crossed euphrates near hierapolis moved eastward carrhae giving impression chosen route persian territory down tigris
reason seems sent force 30000 soldiers under procopius sebastianus further eastward devastate media conjunction armenian forces
two earlier roman campaigns concentrated main persian forces soon directed
julian's strategy lay elsewhere however
fleet built over 1000 ships samosata order supply army march down euphrates 50 pontoon ships facilitate river crossings
procopius armenians march down tigris meet julian near ctesiphon
julian's ultimate aim seems regime change replacing king shapur ii brother hormisdas
after feigning march further eastward julian's army turned south circesium confluence abora khabur euphrates arriving beginning april
passing dura april 6 army made good progress bypassing towns after negotiations besieging those chose oppose
end april romans captured fortress pirisabora guarded canal approach euphrates ctesiphon tigris
army marched toward persian capital sassanids broke dikes crossed land turning marshland slowing progress roman army
ctesiphon mid-may army reached vicinity heavily fortified persian capital ctesiphon julian partially unloaded fleet troops ferried across tigris night
romans gained tactical victory over persians before gates city driving them back city
however persian capital taken main persian army still large approaching while romans lacked clear strategic objective
council war followed julian's generals persuaded mount siege against city given impregnability defenses fact shapur soon arrive large force
julian wanting give up gained probably still hoping arrival column under procopius sebastianus set off east persian interior ordering destruction fleet
proved hasty decision wrong side tigris no clear means retreat persians begun harass them distance burning any food romans' path
second council war 16 june 363 decided best course action lead army back safety roman borders through mesopotamia northward corduene
death sassanian relief investiture ardashir ii showing mithra shapur ii ahura mazda above defeated julian lying prostrate detail fallen julian during withdrawal julian's forces suffered several attacks sassanid forces
such engagement june 363 indecisive battle samarra near maranga julian wounded sassanid army raided column
haste pursuing retreating enemy julian chose speed rather caution taking sword leaving coat mail
received wound spear reportedly pierced lower lobe liver peritoneum intestines
wound immediately deadly
julian treated personal physician oribasius pergamum seems made every attempt treat wound
probably included irrigation wound dark wine procedure known gastrorrhaphy suturing damaged intestine
third day major hemorrhage occurred emperor died during night
julian wished body buried outside tarsus though later removed constantinople
364 libanius stated julian assassinated christian own soldiers charge corroborated ammianus marcellinus other contemporary historians
john malalas reports supposed assassination commanded basil caesarea
fourteen years later libanius julian killed saracen lakhmid may confirmed julian's doctor oribasius having examined wound spear used group lakhmid auxiliaries persian service
later christian historians propagated tradition julian killed saint mercurius
julian succeeded short-lived emperor jovian reestablished christianity's privileged position throughout empire
libanius says epitaph deceased emperor 18
304 mentioned representations julian many cities set beside images gods honour gods
already blessing besought prayer vain
such extent literally ascended gods received share their power themselves
however no similar action taken roman central government dominated christians ensuing decades

julian religious issues beliefs julian's personal religion both pagan philosophical viewed traditional myths allegories ancient gods aspects philosophical divinity
chief surviving sources works king helios mother gods written panegyrics theological treatises
while there clear resemblances other forms late antique religion controversial variety most similar
learned theurgy maximus ephesus student iamblichus system bears resemblance neoplatonism plotinus polymnia athanassiadi brought new attention relations mithraism although whether initiated remains debatable certain aspects thought such reorganization paganism under high priests fundamental monotheism may show christian influence
these potential sources come down us them influenced each other adds difficulties
according theory g
bowersock particular julian's paganism highly eccentric atypical because heavily influenced esoteric approach platonic philosophy sometimes identified theurgy also neoplatonism
others rowland smith particular argued julian's philosophical perspective nothing unusual cultured pagan time any rate julian's paganism limited philosophy alone deeply devoted same gods goddesses other pagans day
because neoplatonist background julian accepted creation humanity described plato's timaeus
julian writes zeus setting things order there fell drops sacred blood them say arose race men
further writes power create man woman able create many men women once
view contrasts christian belief humanity derived pair adam eve
elsewhere argues against single pair origin indicating disbelief noting example how very different their bodies germans scythians libyans ethiopians
christian historian socrates scholasticus opinion julian believed himself alexander great another body via transmigration souls accordance teachings pythagoras plato
diet julian predominantly vegetable-based
restoration paganism state religion julian apostate presiding conference sectarians edward armitage 1875 see also henosis henotheism after gaining purple julian started religious reformation state intended restore lost strength roman state
supported restoration hellenistic polytheism state religion
laws tended target wealthy educated christians aim destroy christianity drive religion out governing classes empire — much buddhism driven back lower classes revived confucian mandarinate 13 th century china
restored pagan temples confiscated since constantine's time simply appropriated wealthy citizens repealed stipends constantine awarded christian bishops removed their other privileges including right consulted appointments act private courts
also reversed favors previously given christians
example reversed constantine's declaration majuma port gaza separate city
majuma large christian congregation while gaza still predominantly pagan
4 february 362 julian promulgated edict guarantee freedom religion
edict proclaimed religions equal before law roman empire return original religious eclecticism according roman state impose any religion provinces
practically however purpose restoration paganism expense christianity
[citation needed] coptic icon showing saint mercurius killing julian
according tradition saint basil old school-mate julian imprisoned start julian's sassanid campaign
basil prayed mercurius help saint appeared vision basil claiming speared julian death
since persecution christians past roman emperors seemingly strengthened christianity many julian's actions designed harass undermine ability christians organize resistance re-establishment paganism empire
julian's preference non-christian non-philosophical view iamblichus' theurgy seems convinced right outlaw practice christian view theurgy demand suppression christian set mysteries
school edict julian required public teachers approved emperor state paid supplemented much their salaries
ammianus marcellinus explains intending prevent christian teachers using pagan texts such iliad widely regarded divinely inspired formed core classical education want learn literature luke mark let them go back their churches expound them edict says
attempt remove power christian schools time later used ancient greek literature their teachings their effort present christian religion being superior paganism
[citation needed] edict also severe financial blow because deprived christian scholars tutors teachers many students
tolerance edict 362 julian decreed reopening pagan temples restitution confiscated temple properties return exile dissident christian bishops
latter instance tolerance different religious views may also seen attempt julian foster schisms divisions different christian sects since conflict rival christian sects quite fierce
care institution pagan hierarchy opposition christians due wish create society every aspect life citizens connected through layers intermediate levels consolidated figure emperor — final provider needs people
within project there no place parallel institution such christian hierarchy christian charity
paganism's shift under julian during julian’s brief reign 361–363 ce popularity among people army indicated might brought paganism back fore roman public private life
fact during lifetime neither pagan nor christian ideology reigned supreme greatest thinkers day argued merits rationality each religion
most importantly pagan cause though rome still predominantly pagan empire wholly accepted christianity
even julian’s short reign stem tide christianity
emperor’s ultimate failure arguably attributed [according whom?] manifold religious traditions deities paganism promulgated
most pagans sought religious affiliations unique their culture people internal divisions prevented them creating any ‘pagan religion
’ indeed term pagan simply convenient appellation christians lump together believers system opposed
truth there no roman religion modern observers recognize
instead paganism came system observances historian characterized “no spongy mass tolerance tradition
system tradition already shifted dramatically time julian came power gone days massive sacrifices honoring gods
communal festivals involved sacrifice feasting once united communities now tore them apart—christian against pagan
civic leaders even funds much less support hold religious festivals
julian found financial base supported these ventures sacred temple funds seized uncle constantine support christian church
julian’s short reign simply shift feeling inertia swept across empire
christians denounced sacrifice stripped temples their funds cut priests magistrates off social prestige financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions past
leading politicians civic leaders little motivation rock boat reviving pagan festivals
instead chose adopt middle ground having ceremonies mass entertainment religiously neutral
after witnessing reign two emperors bent supporting church stamping out paganism understandable that[original research?] pagans simply embrace julian's idea proclaiming their devotion polytheism their rejection christianity
many chose adopt practical approach support julian's public reforms actively fear christian revival
however apathetic attitude forced emperor shift central aspects pagan worship
julian’s attempts reinvigorate people shifted focus paganism system tradition religion same characteristics opposed christianity
example julian attempted introduce tighter organization priesthood greater qualifications character service
classical paganism simply accept idea priests model citizens
priests elites social prestige financial power organized festivals helped pay them
yet julian’s attempt impose moral strictness civic position priesthood made paganism tune christian morality drawing further paganism’s system tradition
indeed development pagan order created foundations bridge reconciliation over paganism christianity meet
likewise julian’s persecution christians pagan standards simply part different cult quite un-pagan attitude transformed paganism religion accepted form religious experience while excluding others—such christianity
trying compete christianity manner julian fundamentally changed nature pagan worship
made paganism religion whereas once system tradition
juventinus maximus despite emperor's attempts reconcile christianity paganism many church fathers viewed hostility stories supposed wickedness after death
sermon saint john chrysostom entitled saints juventinus maximinus tells story two julian's soldiers antioch overheard drinking party criticizing emperor's religious policies taken custody
according john emperor made deliberate effort avoid creating martyrs those disagreed reforms juventinus maximinus admitted being christians refused moderate their stance
john asserts emperor forbade anyone having contact men nobody obeyed orders two men executed middle night
john urges audience visit tomb these martyrs
charity because christian charities open including pagans put aspect roman citizens lives out control imperial authority under church
thus julian envisioned institution roman philanthropic system cared behaviour morality pagan priests hope mitigate reliance pagans christian charity saying these impious galileans feed their own poor ours also welcoming them their agapae attract them children attracted cakes
attempt rebuild jewish temple 363 long before julian left antioch launch campaign against persia keeping effort foster religions other christianity ordered temple rebuilt
personal friend ammianus marcellinus effort julian thought rebuild extravagant expense proud temple once jerusalem committed task alypius antioch
alypius set vigorously work seconded governor province fearful balls fire breaking out near foundations continued their attacks till workmen after repeated scorchings approach no gave up attempt
failure rebuild temple ascribed galilee earthquake 363 jews' ambivalence project
