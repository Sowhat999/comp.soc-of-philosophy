books opinions true believer main article true believer hoffer came public attention 1951 publication first book true believer thoughts nature mass movements
concerned rise totalitarian governments especially those adolf hitler joseph stalin tried find roots these madhouses human psychology
hoffer argued fanatical extremist cultural movements whether religious political arose under predictable circumstances large numbers people come believe their individual lives worthless ruined modern world irreparably corrupt hope lies joining larger group demands radical changes
hoffer believed self-esteem sense satisfaction one's life central importance psychological well-being
thus focused viewed consequences lack self-esteem
example hoffer noted leaders mass movements often frustrated intellectuals adolf hitler 20 th century europe hong xiuquan's failure advance chinese bureaucracy 19 th century
core principle book hoffer's assertion mass movements interchangeable germany 1920 s 1930 s communists nazis ostensibly enemies routinely swapped members competed same kind marginalized angry people fanatical communists became nazis vice versa
almost 2000 years previously saul fanatical persecutor christians became paul christian
true believer hoffer argued substance any particular group less important being part energized movement
hoffer also claimed passionate obsession outside world private lives others attempt compensate lack meaning one's own life
book discusses religious political mass movements includes extensive discussions islam christianity
hoffer's work non-freudian time much american psychology informed freudian paradigm
hoffer appeared public television 1964 then two one-hour conversations cbs eric sevareid late 1960 s
later works subsequent publication true believer 1951 eric hoffer touched upon asia american interventionism several essays
“the awakening asia” 1954 published reporter later book ordeal change 1963 hoffer discusses reasons unrest continent
particular argues root cause social discontent asia government corruption communist agitation legacy european colonial oppression exploitation
rather craving pride/was central problem asia suggesting problem relieved through typical american intervention
centuries hoffer notes asia “submitted conqueror after another
throughout these centuries asia “been misruled looted bled both foreign native oppressors without” much “a peep” general population
though without negative effect corrupt governments legacy european imperialism represented nothing new under sun
indeed european colonial authorities fairly beneficent asia
sure communism exerted appeal sorts
asian pseudo-intellectual promised elite status phony complexities doctrinaire double talk
ordinary asian promised partnership seemingly emergent soviet union tremendous unprecedented undertaking build better tomorrow
according hoffer however communism asia dwarfed desire pride
satisfy such desire asians willingly irrationally sacrifice their economic well-being their lives well
unintentionally west created appetite causing revolutionary unrest” asia
west done eroding traditional communal bonds once woven individual patriarchal family clan tribe cohesive rural urban unit religious political body
without security spiritual meaning produced such bonds asians liberated tradition find themselves now atomized isolated exposed abandoned “left orphaned empty cold world
certainly europe undergone similar destruction tradition occurred centuries earlier end medieval period produced better results thanks different circumstances
asians 1950 s circumstances differed markedly
most illiterate impoverished living world included no expansive physical intellectual vistas
dangerously articulate minority asian population inevitably disconnected themselves ordinary people thereby failing acquire sense usefulness worth came taking part world's work
result condemned life chattering posturing pseudo-intellectuals coveted illusion weight importance
most significantly hoffer asserts disruptive awakening asia came result unbearable sense weakness
indeed hoffer discusses problem weakness asserting while power corrupts few
weakness corrupts many
hoffer notes resentment weak does spring any injustice done [to] them sense their [own] inadequacy impotence
short weak hate wickedness themselves being weak
consequently self-loathing produces explosive effects cannot mitigated through social engineering schemes such programs wealth redistribution
fact american generosity counterproductive perceived asia simply example western oppression
wake korean war hoffer does recommend exporting gunpoint either american political institutions mass democracy
fact hoffer advances possibility winning over multitudes asia may even desirable
other hand necessity truly dictates survival united states must persuade weak asia our side hoffer suggests wisest course action master art technique sharing hope pride last resort hatred others
during vietnam war despite objections antiwar movement acceptance notion war somehow necessary prevent third world war hoffer remained skeptical concerning american interventionism specifically intelligence war being conducted southeast asia
after united states became involved war hoffer wished avoid defeat vietnam because fear such defeat transform american society ill opening door those preach stab-in-the-back myth allow rise american version hitler
temper our time 1967 hoffer implies united states rule should avoid interventions first place better part statesmanship might know clearly precisely leave action improvisation chance
fact hoffer indicates might wise wait enemies defeat themselves might fall upon each other united states out picture
view somewhat borne out cambodian-vietnamese war chinese-vietnamese war late 1970 s
may 1968 year after six day war article los angeles times titled israel's peculiar position jews peculiar people things permitted other nations forbidden jews
other nations drive out thousands even millions people there no refugee problem
russia poland czechoslovakia
turkey threw out million greeks algeria million frenchman
indonesia threw out heaven knows how many chinese no says word refugees
case israel displaced arabs become eternal refugees
everyone insists israel must take back every single
hoffer asks why everyone expects jews real christians world why israel should sue peace after victory
hoffer believed rapid change necessarily positive thing society too rapid change cause regression maturity those brought up different society
noted america 1960 s many young adults still living extended adolescence
seeking explain attraction new left protest movements characterized them result widespread affluence robbing modern society whatever left puberty rites routinize attainment manhood
saw puberty rites essential self-esteem noted mass movements juvenile mindsets tend go together point anyone no matter age joins mass movement immediately begins exhibit juvenile behavior
hoffer further noted working-class americans rarely joined protest movements subcultures since entry meaningful labor effective rite passage out adolescence while both very poor lived welfare affluent words prevented having share world's work proving their manhood doing man's work getting man's pay thus remained state extended adolescence
lacking necessary self-esteem prone joining mass movements form compensation
hoffer suggested need meaningful work rite passage adulthood fulfilled two-year civilian national service program like programs during great depression such civilian conservation corps routinization passage boyhood manhood contribute solution many our pressing problems
cannot think any other undertaking dovetail many our present difficulties opportunities growth
