work mally's deontic logic mally first logician ever attempt axiomatisation ethics
used five axioms given below
form first-order theory quantifies over propositions there several predicates understand first
!x means x ought case
ux means x unconditionally obligatory
!x necessarily true
∩x means x unconditionally forbidden
f binary relation requires
materially implies !b
entailment axioms material conditional
defined axiom iii whereas other terms defined preliminary
note implied universal quantifiers above axioms
fourth axiom confused logicians because formulation expected since mally gave each axiom description words also axiom iv meant unconditionally obligatory obligatory
many logicians insisted ua → !a
meanwhile axiom 5 lacks object predicates apply typo
however turns out these least mally's worries see below
failure mally's deontic logic theorem axiomatisation deontic logic implies !x x true !x unsatisfiable
makes useless deontic logicians
proof using axiom iii axiom may rewritten !a → & → c → !a → c
since → c holds whenever c holds immediate consequence !a → → c → !a → c
other words requires requires any true statement
special case tautology theorem consequence !b → c → !c
thus least statement ought true every statement must materially entail ought true every true statement ought true
statement ought true then statements ought true true consider following logic u → !a & → ∩ → u → !∩ special case axiom consequent contradicts axiom v ¬u → !a & → ∩
result !a → shown follow since !a implies u → !a ¬a implies → ∩ since these both true know !a →
mally thought axiom self-evident likely confused alternative implication → c logical indeed make axiom self-evident
theorem above however then demonstrable
theorem proven karl menger next deontic logician
neither mally's original axioms nor modification avoids result remains popular today
menger suggest own axioms
