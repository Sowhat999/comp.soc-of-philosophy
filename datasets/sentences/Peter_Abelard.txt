notes pope benedict xvi during general audience 4 november 2009 pope benedict xvi talked saint bernard clairvaux peter abelard illustrate differences monastic scholastic approaches theology 12 th century
pope recalled theology search rational understanding possible mysteries christian revelation believed through faith — faith seeks intelligibility fides quaerens intellectum
bernard representative monastic theology emphasized faith whereas abelard scholastic stressed understanding through reason
bernard faith based testimony scripture teaching fathers church
thus bernard found difficult agree abelard general way those subject truths faith critical examination reason — examination opinion posed grave danger intellectualism relativizing truth questioning truths faith themselves
theology bernard nourished contemplative prayer affective union heart mind god purpose promote living intimate experience god aid loving god ever ever better
according pope benedict xvi excessive use philosophy rendered abelard’s doctrine trinity dangerously fragile thus idea god
field morals teaching vague insisted considering intention subject basis describing goodness evil moral acts thereby ignoring objective meaning moral value acts resulting dangerous subjectivism
pope recognized great achievements abelard made decisive contribution development scholastic theology eventually expressed itself mature fruitful way during following century
abelard's insights should underestimated example affirmation non-christian religious traditions already contain form preparation welcoming christ
pope benedict xvi conclude bernard’s theology heart abelard’s theology reason represent importance healthy theological discussion especially questions being debated defined magisterium humble obedience authority church
bernard even abelard himself recognized without any hesitation authority magisterium
abelard showed humility acknowledging errors bernard exercised great benevolence
pope emphasized field theology there should balance architectonic principles given through revelation maintain their primary importance interpretative principles proposed philosophy reason important function tool
balance breaks down theological reflection runs risk becoming marred error then up magisterium exercise needed service truth responsible
letters abelard héloïse story abelard héloïse proved immensely popular modern european culture
story known almost entirely few sources first historia calamitatum secondly seven letters abelard héloïse survive four written abelard three héloïse follow historia calamitatum manuscript tradition thirdly four letters peter venerable héloïse three peter héloïse
modern times best known most widely translated parts abelard's work
unclear quite how letters abelard héloïse came preserved
there brief factual references their relationship 12 th-century writers including william godel walter map
seems unlikely however letters widely known period
rather earliest manuscripts letters dated late 13 th century
therefore seems likely letters sent abelard héloïse kept héloïse paraclete along 'letters direction' century after her death brought paris copied
time story their love affair summarised jean de meun continuation le roman de rose
their story does appear widely known later middle ages either
there no mention couple dante chaucer makes very brief reference wife bath's prologue lines 677–8 no
first people show deeper interest couple appears petrarch owned early 14 th-century manuscript couple's letters
silence today seen particularly touching story perhaps surprising given renaissance ideal courtly love possible story abelard héloïse appropriately fitted ideals lover's devotion chaste unattainable lady
first publication letters latin paris 1616 simultaneously two editions
these editions gave rise numerous translations letters european languages consequent 18 th- 19 th-century interest story medieval lovers
18 th century couple revered tragic lovers endured adversity life united death
reputation individuals pre-revolutionary period whose remains given place honour newly founded cemetery père lachaise paris
time effectively revered romantic saints forerunners modernity odds ecclesiastical monastic structures their day celebrated rejecting traditions past any particular intellectual achievement
historia first published 1841 john caspar orelli turici
then 1849 victor cousin published petri abaelardi opera part based two paris editions 1616 also based reading four manuscripts became standard edition letters
soon after 1855 migne printed expanded version 1616 edition under title opera petri abaelardi without name héloïse title page
critical editions historia calamitatum letters subsequently published 1950 s 1960 s
various times past two hundred years suggested letters genuine
questions first raised 1806 ignaz fessler renewed j
orelli 1844 ludovic lalanne 1855 suggested letters might simply literary fiction
doubts raised intervals succeeding decades
recently john benton hypothesised 1972 entire letter collection might forged late 13 th century abelard himself position benton reverted 1979
aftermath reaction benton's thought though scholars become confident asserting genuine nature letters
according historian constant mews lost love letters héloïse abelard 113 anonymous love letters found 15 th-century manuscript represent correspondence exchanged héloïse abelard during earlier phase their affair
these confused accepted letters abelard héloïse written nearly fifteen years after their romance ended
music abelard also long known important poet composer
composed celebrated love songs héloïse now lost identified anonymous repertoire
héloïse praised these songs letter great charm sweetness language music soft attractiveness melody obliged even unlettered
abelard composed hymnbook religious community héloïse joined
hymnbook written after 1130 differed contemporary hymnals such bernard clairvaux abelard used completely new homogeneous material
songs grouped metre meant comparatively few melodies used
melody hymnal survives o quanta qualia
abelard also six biblical planctus laments planctus dinae filiae iacob inc
abrahae proles israel nata planctus planctus iacob super filios suos inc

planctus vi fixed square notation
planctus genre influenced subsequent development lai song form flourished northern europe 13 th 14 th centuries
melodies survived praised flexible expressive melodies [that] show elegance technical adroitness very similar qualities long admired abelard's poetry
