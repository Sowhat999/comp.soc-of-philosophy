upon graduation partly because needed credits begin graduate studies bernstein returned new york city couple years study columbia university took courses variety subjects ranging ancient greek book binding obtained bachelor science degree graduating summa cum laude
1953 following rorty’s advice went yale university pursue graduate studies philosophy writing dissertation john dewey’s metaphysics experience
time interest dewey reaching all-time low partly due rising influence analytic philosophy prejudiced conviction there much learned classical american pragmatists
indeed many philosophers under sway analytic wave work charles sanders peirce william james john dewey just half-baked version real philosophical inquiries being conducted analytic philosophy
early however bernstein became aware damaging consequences labeled “analytic ideology”
“the belief analytic style game town rest philosophy dismissed simply really worthwhile
course “analytic ideology” should confused hard-won results analytic philosophy
reasons decided go yale because few departments resisted questionable ideology offering stimulating atmosphere thinkers like hegel kierkegaard nietzsche read same enthusiasm seriousness wittgenstein carnap
there studied under remarkable group teachers including carl gustav hempel john smith george schrader paul weiss
career bernstein began teach first courses yale around 1954 years old
1958 after year fulbright lecturer hebrew university returned yale assistant professor philosophy
return coincided arrival new member faculty thinker greatly influence bernstein’s own work approach philosophy wilfrid sellars
bernstein recalls “it sellars taught me employ analytic techniques deal fundamental philosophic issues
strongly admired way combined sophisticated understanding history philosophy ‘new way words’ attended many seminars during highly creative stage philosophic development
1964 became editor review metaphysics philosophic journal founded paul weiss few accepted contributions different traditions schools thought
pages find articles prominent analytic thinkers like quine sellars side-by-side articles leo strauss even translations heidegger
same year joined group faculty participate civil rights movement anti-vietnam war protests summer traveled mississippi take part freedom summer project student nonviolent coordinating committee
1965 after teaching yale almost ten years spite having unanimous support entire philosophy faculty large number students denied tenure yale tenure committee
event sometimes referred bernstein affair sparked number student protests eventually led reforms tenure system yale
professor paul weiss summed up inconformity philosophical community stated “the committee came conclusion slowly conscientiously does mean decision stupid unfair dismaying will take university department long time recover
other philosophy departments soon tried recruit young bernstein after considering offerings thirty institutions decided go haverford college prestigious liberal arts college taught following 23 years
during time haverford bernstein published most famous books including praxis action contemporary philosophies human activity 1971 restructuring social political theory 1978 beyond objectivism relativism science hermeneutics praxis 1983 philosophical profiles essays pragmatic mode 1986
1972 met jürgen habermas establishing friendship grown over years reflected exchanges projects undertaken last forty years
1976 while spending semester haverford habermas asked bernstein join directing seminar held dubrovnik support eight dissident yugoslavian marxists praxis group dismissed belgrade university because their political views
rather informal gesture solidarity became international institution attracting over years group intellectuals including albrecht wellmer charles taylor anthony giddens cornelius castoriadis richard rorty alain touraine agnes heller young graduate students seyla benhabib nancy fraser judith butler
bernstein’s involvement dubrovnik seminar expanded 1980 became founding co-editor praxis international successor important yugoslav journal praxis critics stalinism proponents “marxist humanism” write
1989 bernstein elected president eastern division american philosophical association delivering presidential address entitled “pragmatism pluralism healing wounds”
same year invited join graduate faculty new school social research new york city time experiencing great hardships desperately needed recreate itself
together agnes heller reiner schürmann bernstein led reconstruction philosophy department served chair 1989 2002
during time new school bernstein written books hannah arendt sigmund freud radical evil pragmatismand violence
philosophical themes fusion philosophical horizons bernstein work embodies pragmatist ethos tirelessly articulated since first publications
engaged pluralism fallibilism public deliberation abstract philosophical concepts practical guidelines must orient responsible action
thanks dialogical approach played crucial role broadening philosophical horizon american philosophy
bernstein “has rare capacity weave coherent vision out disparate strands seemingly conflicting intellectual traditions
regularly showed us how see past surface contradictions underlying problems share sometimes common assumptions animate contemporary sensibilities
moreover bernstein “opened pragmatism international intellectual currents including phenomenology deconstruction critical theory
result cosmopolitan pragmatism less centered united states appropriate globalizing world
bernstein’s conviction many themes classical american pragmatism resurfaced work most prominent twentieth twenty-first-century philosophers
calls pragmatic turn philosophy subtle important shift brought together thinkers diverse wittgenstein heidegger putnam habermas honneth brandom
overcoming cartesian anxiety 1983 book beyond objectivism relativism science hermeneutics praxis bernstein diagnosed serious issue affects much modern philosophy oscillates unendingly two untenable positions hand dogmatic search absolute truths other conviction “anything goes” comes justification our most cherished beliefs ideas
according bernstein underlies predicament deep longing certainty urge “to find fixed point stable rock upon secure our lives against vicissitudes constantly threaten us
calls cartesian anxiety mostly unacknowledged existential fear seems lead us ineluctably grand either/or “either there support our being fixed foundation our knowledge cannot escape forces darkness envelop us madness intellectual moral chaos”
although philosophy cartesian anxiety mostly shows up discussion epistemological issues bernstein pointing something much deeper universal notion something permeates almost every aspect life serious ethical political consequences
after name religious ideological absolutes greatest atrocities injustices human history perpetrated
bernstein’s strategy exorcize cartesian anxiety challenge underlying assumption namely type foundations support our knowledge world our everyday practices must unshakeable eternally fixed
appealing ancient tradition practical philosophy contemporary proponents like hannah arendt jürgen habermas hans-georg-gadamer bernstein able show acknowledging our finitude fallibility our beliefs convictions incompatible truth knowledge getting things right
pragmatic fallibilism bernstein “the spirit critical pragmatic fallibilism represents best american tradition global significance
although most part fallibilism seen epistemological doctrine bernstein argues extrapolate significance other realms human existence
“fallibilism belief any knowledge claim generally any validity claim—including moral political claims—is open ongoing examination modification critique
indeed specialized scientific epistemological doctrine fallibilism ethical political stance outlook life need cultivate want exorcise cartesian anxiety overcome grand either/or relativism foundationalism affects contemporary culture
bernstein consistently explored consequences pragmatic fallibilism both philosophical thought also broader cultural debates evil radical evil philosophical interrogation abuse evil corruption politics religion since 9/11 violence violence thinking without banisters
judgment throughout work bernstein defended importance practical judgment phronesis dealing complex social political ethical cultural issues confront us our everyday life
fact there no algorithms ahistorical decision procedures deal these issues must motive despair
cartesian anxiety rather first step realization comes human affairs type reasoning appropriate praxis ability justice particular situations their particularity
aristotle called phronēsis “practical wisdom” form reasoning knowledge involves distinctive mediation universal particular
“this mediation accomplished any appeal technical rules method cartesian sense subsumption pregiven determinate universal particular case
‘intellectual virtue’ phronēsis form reasoning yielding type ethical know-how universal particular codetermined
moreover view bernstein's project attempt democratize phronēsis show great importance cultivating dialogical communities different arguments opinions taken consideration decisions result process serious communal deliberation
engaged pluralism democratic ethos addition pragmatic fallibilism judgment bernstein also highlights importance cultivating engaged pluralism ethos also central classical american pragmatists particularly james dewey
1988 presidential address eastern division american philosophical association bernstein defined engaged fallibilism genuine willingness listen others “being vigilant against dual temptations simply dismissing others saying falling back those standard defensive ploys condemn obscure wooly trivial thinking easily translate alien our own entrenched vocabularies
james observed essay “on certain blindness human beings” tend egocentric insensitive feelings opinions convictions those really different us
“hence stupidity injustice our opinions far deal significance alien lives
hence falsity our judgments far presume decide absolute way value other persons’ conditions ideals
really listen becomes most important virtues true democratic community
course listening much just hearing even paying attention other saying openness words gadamer another bernstein’s closest interlocutors “involves recognizing myself must accept things against me even though no else forces me
pluralism ethical sense intimately related democracy understood set institutions political procedures rather ethical way life like john dewey used say
such democracy form government ongoing practical endeavor task lies before us forces us continually rebuild reenergize public space meet discuss “problems men”
bernstein emphasizes requires commitment hard work cultivation certain habits attitudes feelings institutions
ultimately healthy democracy turns out most effective antidote against cartesian anxiety quest absolutes best way reach concrete yet non-relativist communal solutions our public concerns
