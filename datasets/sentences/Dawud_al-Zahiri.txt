most commonly attributed iranian city isfahan often being referred dawud al-isfahani
ibn hazm al-dhahabi christopher melchert others held attribution due fact al-zahiri's mother native isfahan actually iraqi origins having born city kufa
ignác goldziher agreed al-zahiri born kufa attributed confusion regarding place birth due father's role civil service abbasid caliph al-ma'mun kashan smaller city near isfahan
education during formative years al-zahiri relocated kufa baghdad studied prophetic tradition qur'anic exegesis number notable scholars during time including abu thawr yahya ibn ma'in ahmad bin hanbal
study under renowned figures traditionalist theology contrast views father follower less orthodox hanafi school
indian reformist chiragh ali suggested zahiri's school like ibn hanbal's actually direct reaction hanafi system
toward end education al-zahiri traveled nishapur greater khorasan order complete studies ishaq ibn rahwayh time considered champion traditionalist sunni philosophy
ibn al-jawzi noted studying ibn rahwayh considered most knowledgeable scholars muslim history al-zahiri willing debate ibn rahwayh religious topics something no else ever dared
rahwayh criticized al-shafi‘i during lesson debate ensued zahiri alleged rahwayh didn't understand al-shafi'i's point topic discussion though ibn hanbal physically present debate declared rahwayh winner
al-zahiri initially follower al-shafi‘i jurisprudence later branching off terms principles likely due influence ibn rahwayh
describing fanatical both adherence shafi'i own school later encyclopedia islam describes al-zahiri's school one-sided elaboration shafi'i's taking latter's rejection juristic discretion principle formulating law applying forms human reasoning
teaching after completing studies nishapur al-zahiri returned baghdad began delivering own lessons
while historians differ regarding exact number students agreed following large most estimates ranging four five hundred students regularly attend majlis
reputation spread outside baghdad even high-level scholars elsewhere muslim world began seeking al-zahiri's advice religious topics study
while views universally accepted time no attempts made contemporaries prevent granting religious verdicts nor opposed teaching position
most well-known students son muhammad bin dawud al-zahiri abdullah son ibn hanbal muhammad ibn jarir al-tabari niftawayh ruwaym
zahiri also teacher early jurist abd allah al-qaysi responsible spreading zahirite school al-andalus
death al-zahiri died during month ramadan baghdad buried
exact year died according gregorian calendar matter dispute historians having stated both 883 ce 884 ce
views creed terms theology al-zahiri described ibn taymiyyah having upon orthodox athari creed affirming attributes god without delving their fundamental nature
al-shahrastani 12 th-century historian religions grouped al-zahiri along malik bin anas ibn hanbal sufyan al-thawri early sunni figures rejected both esoteric anthropotheistic interpretations god both ibn taymiyyah al-shahrastani considered al-zahiri students along malik ibn hanbal al-thawri abu thawr al-mawardi al-shafi'i their students people hadith opposed people ra'y
creed delving fundamental nature texts likely affected al-zahiri's views literalism well
while major figures islam united upon qur'an sunnah being foremost sources law al-zahiri held these two sources must also taken literal meanings applied particular circumstances described
analogical reasoning al-zahiri rejected qiyas otherwise known analogical reasoning method deducing rulings jurisprudence regarding form bid‘ah addition islam muhammad allowed
there conflicting views regarding al-zahiri's position specific causality command prohibition within qur'an prophetic example stated due different historians recording opposing statements
take view al-zahiri restricted ruling incident condition causality arose seeing causality provides concrete law others take view instead form general principle event stated causality
consensus al-zahiri considered ijma religiously binding consensus consist consensus muhammad's direct companions excluding other generations after them definition
matter al-zahiri actually agreement ibn hanbal abu hanifa figureheads two other prominent sunni schools thought
nature qur'an while al-zahiri time studied hadith studies under ibn hanbal later barred study due dispute regarding nature qur'an al-zahiri stated qur'an muhdath recently occurring stance ibn hanbal strongly disapproved
even before time ibn hanbal actually cut off contact anyone study consult zahiri regarding religious matters habit ibn hanbal started after witnessing zahiri's defense al-shafi'i against rahwayh
rumor regarding zahiri's statement qur'an added fuel fire
syrian historian ibn taymiyyah dispute semantic nature arising confusion al-zahiri's intended meaning - god existent without peers - intended meaning jahmites mu'tazila - qur'an created
thus al-zahiri ibn hanbal al-shafi'i ibn rahwayh al-tabari malik ibn anas sufyan al-thawri abd al-rahman al-awza'i abū ḥanīfa ibn khuzaymah abdullah ibn mubarak al-darimi muhammad al-bukhari - described ibn taymiyyah leading figures islam time - agreed qur'an uncreated semantic misunderstanding arose al-zahiri al-bukhari muslim bin al-hajjaj others used phrase recently occurring establish god qur'an believed muslims literal speech god same thing rather god's speech attribute
modern-day scholarship suggested light weakness chains narration connecting phrase qur'an recently occurring al-zahiri al-zahiri may never made such statement held such belief
due al-zahiri's denial analogical reasoning blind following - cornerstones other main sunni schools thought - students those schools may forged statement attributed al-zahiri means pushing common people away school thought
abu ubaida further supported point noting al-zahiri students actually severer their opposition mu'tazila their belief qur'an created ibn hanbal using harsh language their written responses such beliefs
usury al-zahiri held view in-kind exchanges goods forbidden type usury applies six commodities specified muhammad gold silver wheat barley dates salt
because al-zahiri rejected use analogical reasoning jurisprudence disagreed majority view prohibition excess gain in-kind exchanges commodities consider such gains form interest
muhammad intended include commodities other above six done because specified usury prohibited these six commodities muslims free deal other commodities liked al-zahiri saw no basis making analogy any other commodities
female dress according al-shawkani al-zahiri regarded muslim face veil recommended rather obligatory seeing woman's face uncovered public other body parts must covered
position ibn hanbal well
traveling muslim begins traveling while fasting during month ramadan al-zahiri saw individual should break their fast day started their journey view ibn hanbal ibn rahwayh agreed
due qur'anic verse allowing traveler skip ramadan fast make up complete their journey
muslim fast while traveling still make up days skipped according al-zahiri's view verse wasn't merely allowance breaking fast command
most muslims shorten length their prayers while traveling well
traveling muslim shortens prayers breaks fast topic discussion among jurists distance duration
al-zahiri saw any form traveling regardless distance duration allowed individual shorten their prayers
works al-zahiri known being prolific author persian historian ibn al-nadim able personally record names least 157 al-zahiri's written works majority topics within islamic studies
these works very long covered both legal theory branches positive law
also considered first person written biography former teacher al-shafi'i
melchert cites ibn al-nadim ibn 'abd al-barr claim zahiri's biography shafi'i just first biography shafi'i first major biography any muslim jurist ever written
none these works survived modern era their entirety
ibn al-nadim also mentions after al-shafi'i's al-risala ibn hanbal al-zahiri next major sunni figures author works principles islamic jurisprudence al-zahiri producing number works topics including rejection blindly following clergymen difference general specific verses qur'an difference succinct detailed commands religion views experiences former teacher al-shafi'i
modern scholarship pieced together chapter headings al-zahiri's work juristic principles other early works following order binding consensus invalidity blindly following clergy invalidity analogical reason traditions transmitted single authorities traditions provide certainty incontrovertible proof particular vs
general scriptural texts specified vs
unspecified texts
chapters - perhaps even information contained therein - primarily preserved work fatimid writer qadi al-nu'man addition passages al-muhalla sunni jurist ibn hazm adherent al-zahiri's legal school
contemporary evaluation although al-zahiri's religious views considered controversial character religious piety carry universal acclaim
al-khatib al-baghdadi al-suyuti muhammad nasiruddin al-albani al-dhahabi al-nawawi al-tabari attested morality humility personal ethics
sunni view while al-zahiri's school numerous today other four major schools sunni thought zahiri dawudi school known islam's early stages once major school encompassed mesopotamia iberian peninsula balearic islands north africa southern iran
even contemporary critics conceded intellect level knowledge even while rejecting beliefs
described scholar era al-dhahabi hierarchy religious knowledge baghdad considered ended al-zahiri top
al-tabari asked regarding books ibn qutaybah answered ibn qutaybah's work nothing recommended books people jurisprudence mentioning al-shafi'i al-zahiri name then their contemporaries
members other schools often criticized al-zahiri rejection analogical reasoning
early followers al-shafi'i general held negative views their former classmate followers shafi'ite school al-juwayni particular harsh upon al-zahiri himself
universal many followers shafi'i school taken accommodating views al-zahiri's legal rulings
al-dhahabi defended al-zahiri followers stating just al-juwayni arrived views process scholarly discourse al-zahiri
likewise ibn al-salah also defended legitimacy al-zahiris views school listing number figures other sunni schools thought considered al-zahiri's opinions scholarly discourse
shi'ite view shi'ites taken dimmer view al-zahiri school
1970 s twelver shi'ite scholar abdul kareem mushtaq accused al-zahiri having held anthropotheistic beliefs regarding god citing sunni historian al-shahrastani source
nearly four decades later section al-shahrastani's work translated english demonstrating al-shahrastani actually stated al-zahiri didn't hold anthropotheistic beliefs
al-shahrastani stated aĥmad ibn ĥanbal dāwūd ibn `alī al-işfahānī group imāms predecessors took methodological course early predecessors people narrations—such mālik ibn anas muqātil ibn sulaymān—and followed safe path
‘we believe whatever mentioned book sunna come grips interpretation after certainly know allāh powerful exalted does resemble anything creation portrayed imagination created foreordained
’ used guard themselves anthropomorphism such degree ‘whosoever moved hand during recitation statement ‘…i created my hands?’ pointed two fingers during narration ‘the heart believer two fingers merciful’ hand should cut two fingers removed
ismaili shi'ites perhaps accurate criticized al-zahiri
al-nu'man particularly critical al-zahiri rejecting analogical reason yet same time accepting inference valid means logical deduction position also criticized al-zahiri's son school general
mu'tazilite view being steeped esoteric philosophy mu'tazila quite hostile towards al-zahiri school
although prominent mu'tazilite figures such al-nazzam denied validity analogical reasoning al-zahiri also denied literalism validity consensus most them found al-zahiri's ideas ridiculous
