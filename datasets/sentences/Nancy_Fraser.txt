fraser argues justice understood two separate interrelated ways distributive justice terms equitable distribution resources justice recognition equal recognition different identities/groups within society
there two corresponding forms injustice maldistribution misrecognition
fraser argues many social justice movement 1960 s 1970 s argued recognition basis race gender sexuality ethnicity focus correcting misrecognition eclipsed importance challenging persistent problems maldistribution
other words fraser asserts too much focus identity politics diverts attention away deleterious effects neoliberal capitalism growing wealth inequality characterizes many societies
recent work fraser goes even further linking narrow focus identity politics widening gap rich poor particularly regard liberal feminism fraser calls handmaiden capitalism
reflecting sheryl sandberg's 2013 book lean fraser explained “for me feminism simply matter getting smattering individual women positions power privilege within existing social hierarchies
rather overcoming those hierarchies
requires challenging structural sources gender domination capitalist society — above institutionalized separation two supposedly distinct kinds activity hand so-called “productive” labor historically associated men remunerated wages other hand “caring” activities often historically unpaid still performed mainly women
my view gendered hierarchical division “production” “reproduction” defining structure capitalist society deep source gender asymmetries hard-wired
there no “emancipation women” long structure remains intact

mitchell writer marx & philosophy writes “this [complexity] perhaps owing her propensity avail herself whatever terms best encapsulate processes institutionalized oppression
thinking thus ground up gives her work complexity times compromises systematic quality coherence her theoretical categories

contemporaries such douglas kellner praised fraser’s writings “seasoned social hope” effectively synthesizing feminist commitment political agency social progress several forms modern postmodern social scepticism however her goals providing “the sort big diagnostic picture necessary orient [the current] political practice” socialist feminism criticized being too ambitious ultimately narrow their execution
