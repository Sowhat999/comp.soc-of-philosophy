hertz's daughters never married no descendants
contributions meteorology hertz deep interest meteorology probably derived contacts wilhelm von bezold professor laboratory course munich polytechnic summer 1878
however hertz contribute much field himself except early articles assistant helmholtz berlin including research evaporation liquids new kind hygrometer graphical means determining properties moist air subjected adiabatic changes
contact mechanics memorial heinrich hertz campus karlsruhe institute technology translates site heinrich hertz discovered electromagnetic waves years 1885–1889
main article contact mechanics 1886–1889 hertz published two articles become known field contact mechanics
hertz well known contributions field electrodynamics see below however most papers look fundamental nature contact cite two papers source important ideas
joseph valentin boussinesq published critically important observations hertz's work nevertheless establishing work contact mechanics immense importance
work basically summarises how two axi-symmetric objects placed contact will behave under loading obtained results based upon classical theory elasticity continuum mechanics
most significant failure theory neglect any nature adhesion two solids proves important materials composing solids start assume high elasticity
natural neglect adhesion age there no experimental methods testing
develop theory hertz used observation elliptical newton's rings formed upon placing glass sphere upon lens basis assuming pressure exerted sphere follows elliptical distribution
used formation newton's rings again while validating theory experiments calculating displacement sphere lens
johnson k
roberts jkr used theory basis while calculating theoretical displacement indentation depth presence adhesion 1971
hertz's theory recovered their formulation adhesion materials assumed zero
similar theory however using different assumptions
derjaguin v
toporov published another theory 1975 came known dmt theory research community also recovered hertz's formulations under assumption zero adhesion
dmt theory proved rather premature needed several revisions before came accepted another material contact theory addition jkr theory
both dmt jkr theories form basis contact mechanics upon transition contact models based used material parameter prediction nanoindentation atomic force microscopy
hertz's research days lecturer preceding great work electromagnetism himself considered characteristic soberness trivial come down age nanotechnology
electromagnetic research hertz's 1887 apparatus generating detecting radio waves spark transmitter left consisting dipole antenna spark gap powered high voltage pulses ruhmkorff coil receiver right consisting loop antenna spark gap
hertz's radio wave receivers loop antenna adjustable micrometer spark gap bottom
during hertz's studies 1879 helmholtz suggested hertz's doctoral dissertation testing maxwell's theory electromagnetism published 1865 predicted existence electromagnetic waves moving speed light predicted light itself just such wave
helmholtz also proposed berlin prize problem year prussian academy sciences anyone experimentally prove electromagnetic effect polarization depolarization insulators something predicted maxwell's theory
helmholtz sure hertz most likely candidate win
seeing any way build apparatus experimentally test hertz thought too difficult worked electromagnetic induction instead
hertz produce analysis maxwell's equations during time kiel showing validity then prevalent action distance theories
after hertz received professorship karlsruhe experimenting pair riess spirals autumn 1886 noticed discharging leyden jar these coils produce spark other coil
idea how build apparatus hertz now way proceed berlin prize problem 1879 proving maxwell's theory although actual prize expired uncollected 1882
used ruhmkorff coil-driven spark gap one-meter wire pair radiator
capacity spheres present ends circuit resonance adjustments
receiver precursor dipole antenna simple half-wave dipole antenna
experiment produced received now called radio waves very high frequency range
hertz's first radio transmitter dipole resonator consisting pair meter copper wires ending 30 cm zinc spheres
induction coil applied high voltage two sides sparks across center spark gap created standing waves radio frequency current wires radiated radio waves
frequency waves roughly 100 mhz used modern television transmitters
1886 1889 hertz conduct series experiments prove effects observing results maxwell's predicted electromagnetic waves
starting november 1887 paper electromagnetic effects produced electrical disturbances insulators hertz send series papers helmholtz berlin academy including papers 1888 showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling finite speed over distance
apparatus hertz used electric magnetic fields radiate away wires transverse waves
hertz positioned oscillator 12 meters zinc reflecting plate produce standing waves
each wave 4 meters long
using ring detector recorded how wave's magnitude component direction varied
hertz measured maxwell's waves demonstrated velocity these waves equal velocity light
electric field intensity polarity reflection waves also measured hertz
these experiments established light these waves both form electromagnetic radiation obeying maxwell equations
hertz also described hertzian cone type wave-front propagation through various media
hertz's directional spark transmitter center half-wave dipole antenna made two 13 cm brass rods spark gap center closeup left powered ruhmkorff coil focal line
2 m x 2 m cylindrical sheet metal parabolic reflector
radiated beam 66 cm waves frequency 450 mhz
receiver right similar parabolic dipole antenna micrometer spark gap
hertz's demonstration polarization radio waves receiver does respond antennas perpendicular shown receiver rotated received signal grows stronger shown length sparks until reaches maximum dipoles parallel
another demonstration polarization waves pass through polarizing filter receiver wires perpendicular dipoles parallel
demonstration refraction radio waves bend passing through prism made pitch similarly light waves passing through glass prism
hertz' plot standing waves created radio waves reflected sheet metal hertz helped establish photoelectric effect later explained albert einstein noticed charged object loses charge readily illuminated ultraviolet light
1887 made observations photoelectric effect production reception electromagnetic em waves published journal annalen physik
receiver consisted coil spark gap whereby spark seen upon detection em waves
placed apparatus darkened box see spark better
observed maximum spark length reduced box
glass panel placed source em waves receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation uv assisted electrons jumping across gap
removed spark length increase
observed no decrease spark length substituted quartz glass quartz does absorb uv radiation
hertz concluded months investigation reported results obtained
further pursue investigation effect nor make any attempt explaining how observed phenomenon brought
hertz realize practical importance experiments
stated it's no use whatsoever[
just experiment proves maestro maxwell right—we just these mysterious electromagnetic waves cannot see naked eye
asked ramifications discoveries hertz replied nothing guess
official english translation untersuchungen über die ausbreitung elektrischen kraft published 1893 year before hertz's death
hertz's proof existence airborne electromagnetic waves referred hertzian waves early lead experimentation new form electromagnetic radiation eventual development commercial hertzian wave based wireless telegraphy radio audio radio later television
1892 hertz began experimenting demonstrated cathode rays penetrate very thin metal foil such aluminium
philipp lenard student heinrich hertz further researched ray effect
developed version cathode tube studied penetration x-rays various materials
philipp lenard though realize producing x-rays
hermann von helmholtz formulated mathematical equations x-rays
postulated dispersion theory before röntgen made discovery announcement
formed basis electromagnetic theory light wiedmann's annalen vol
however work actual x-rays
nazi persecution heinrich hertz lutheran throughout life considered himself jewish father's family converted lutheranism father still childhood aged seven 1834
nevertheless nazi regime gained power decades after hertz's death portrait removed them prominent position honor hamburg's city hall rathaus because partly jewish ancestry
painting since returned public display
hertz's widow daughters left germany 1930 s went england
legacy honors heinrich hertz heinrich hertz's nephew gustav ludwig hertz nobel prize winner gustav's son carl helmut hertz invented medical ultrasonography
