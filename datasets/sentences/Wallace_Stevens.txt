poetry stevens rare example poet whose main output came fairly advanced age
first major publication four poems sequence entitled phases november 1914 edition poetry magazine written age 35 although undergraduate harvard stevens written poetry exchanged sonnets george santayana whom close through much life
many canonical works written well after turned 50
according literary critic harold bloom called stevens best most representative american poet time no western writer since sophocles such late flowering artistic genius
contemporary harriet monroe stevens 'a poet rich numerous profound provocative joy creative beauty those respond him'
helen vendler notes there three distinguishable moods present stevens' long poems ecstasy apathy reluctance ecstasy apathy
she also notes poetry highly influenced paintings paul klee paul cézanne stevens saw paintings both paul klee—who favorite painter—and cézanne kind work wanted himself modernist poet
klee imagined symbols
klee directly realistic painter full whimsical fanciful imaginative humorous projections reality paintings
paintings often enigmatic full riddles stevens liked well
stevens liked cézanne reduction you might say world few monumental objects
stevens's first book poetry volume rococo inventiveness titled harmonium published 1923
produced two major books poetry during 1920 s 1930 s three 1940 s
received annual national book award poetry twice 1951 auroras autumn 1955 collected poems
imagination reality stevens whose work meditative philosophical very much poet ideas
poem must resist intelligence / almost successfully
concerning relation consciousness world stevens's work imagination equivalent consciousness nor reality equivalent world exists outside our minds
reality product imagination shapes world
because constantly changing attempt find imaginatively satisfying ways perceive world reality activity static object
approach reality piecemeal understanding putting together parts world attempt make seem coherent
make sense world construct worldview through active exercise imagination
no dry philosophical activity passionate engagement finding order meaning
thus stevens write idea order key west oh! blessed rage order pale ramon maker's rage order words sea words fragrant portals dimly-starred ourselves our origins ghostlier demarcations keener sounds
book opus posthumous stevens writes after abandoned belief god poetry essence takes place life’s redemption
poet attempts find fiction replace lost gods immediately encounters problem direct knowledge reality possible
stevens suggests live tension shapes take world acts upon us ideas order our imagination imposes upon world
world influences us our most normal activities dress woman lhassa / place / invisible element place / made visible
likewise place jar hill tennessee impose order onto landscape
stevens says essay imagination value truth seems live concepts imagination before reason established them
imagination mechanism unconsciously conceptualize normal patterns life while reason way consciously conceptualize these patterns
supreme fiction imagination loses vitality ceases adhere real
adheres unreal intensifies unreal while first effect may extraordinary effect maximum effect will ever
throughout poetic career stevens concerned question think world now our old notions religion no longer suffice
solution might summarized notion supreme fiction idea serve fictive replacement idea god known fictive willfully believed
example satirical high-toned old christian woman stevens plays notions immediately accessible ultimately unsatisfying notions reality poetry supreme fiction madame
take moral law make nave nave build haunted heaven
thus conscience converted palms like windy citherns hankering hymns
agree principle
that’s clear
take opposing law make peristyle peristyle project masque beyond planets
thus our bawdiness unpurged epitaph indulged last equally converted palms squiggling like saxophones
palm palm madame began
saxophones squiggle because j
hillis miller says stevens book poets reality theme universal fluctuation constant theme throughout stevens's poetry great many stevens' poems show object group objects aimless oscillation circling movement
end reality remains
supreme fiction conceptualization reality seems resonate rightness much seems captured moment something actual real
am angel reality seen moment standing door
am necessary angel earth since my sight you see earth again cleared stiff stubborn man-locked set my hearing you hear tragic drone rise liquidly liquid lingerings like watery words awash
apparition appareled apparels such lightest look turn my shoulder quickly too quickly am gone? last poems final soliloquy interior paramour stevens describes experience idea satisfies imagination therefore intensest rendezvous
/ thought collect ourselves / out indifferences thing
thing “a light power miraculous influence wherein forget ourselves sensing comforting order knowledge arranged rendezvous / within vital boundary mind
knowledge necessarily exists within mind since aspect imagination never attain direct experience reality
say god imagination
how high highest candle lights dark
out same light out central mind make dwelling evening air being there together enough
stevens concludes god human creation feeling rightness long time existed idea god may accessed again
supreme fiction will something equally central our being contemporary our lives way god never again
right idea may again find same sort solace once found divinity
[stevens] finds too definite value complete contact reality
fact stark knowledge attain own spiritual self resist disintegrating forces life
powerful force though mind
cannot find absolutes
heaven lies seeing man sensuous apprehension world
everything part truth
poetry exceeding music must take place empty heaven hymns ourselves poetry must take their place way stevens's poems adopt attitudes corollaries those earlier spiritual longings persist unconscious currents imagination
poem refreshes life share / moment first idea
satisfies / belief immaculate beginning / sends us winged unconscious will / immaculate end
first idea essential reality stands before others essential truth since knowledge contingent time place supreme fiction will surely transitory
necessary angel subjective reality—a reality must qualified—and such misses mark degree—always contains elements unreality
miller summarizes stevens's position though dissolving self way end everything another way happy liberation
there two entities left now gods dead man nature subject object
nature physical world visible audible tangible present senses man consciousness nothing receives nature transforms something unreal
literary influence first critics fellow poets praised stevens
hart crane friend 1919 after reading poems make up harmonium there man whose work makes most rest us quail
