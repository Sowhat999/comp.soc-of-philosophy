metaethics definition morality gert advocates following definition morality morality informal public system applying rational persons governing behavior affects others includes commonly known moral rules ideals virtues lessening evil harm goal
morality known according gert theory counts natural law theory because holds moral agents must able understand morality order count moral agents
other words moral judgments made those know kind behavior morality prohibits requires discourages encourages allows
harm central moral concept according gert harm evil central moral concept
gert believes harm rational creatures seek avoid
advances following five-concept account harm death pain disability loss freedom loss pleasure
maintains commonsense morality far concerned prohibiting discouraging evil requiring encouraging people enhance goods benefits
rationality impartiality gert's view bases morality rationality impartiality
gert's conception rationality irrational fail averse harm
everyone avoids harm insofar rational
rationality does require avoid harming ourselves without adequate reason
rational person cause own pain unless adequate reason example cure disease
even masochist causes pain himself reason presumably pleasure
helps show no rational being seeks harm himself own sake
sort adequate reason question involves avoiding any five basic evils obtaining any following basic goods pleasure freedom ability consciousness according gert acting rationally does require acting morally
example irrational set trap someone wearing armani suit fall swimming pool front video camera since pleasure get out watching video constitutes adequate reason harming other person
also rational sadist torture other people fun provided sadist get away
there five sorts irrational desire according gert seeking death pain disability loss freedom loss pleasure
arrive moral rules extending these objects irrational desire others
rationality alone does require
however adopt principle impartiality whereby apply rules without regard gains loses extend these prohibitions others
results rules such kill cause pain disable forth
why moral? gert's view there several reasons act morally
primary someone else will harmed
while rational care others fact will harmed enough reason itself
other reasons act morally include ii acting immorally will corrupt one's own character iii forms immoral action make world inhospitable oneself such cases irrational act immorally toward others
normative ethics ten moral rules book common morality deciding gert proposes ten moral rules followed create moral system
rules follows kill cause pain disable deprive freedom deprive pleasure deceive keep your promises cheat obey law your duty
first five these rules directly prohibit harming other people
thus summarized slogan 'do harm'
second five rules get their force fact generally allowed those rules broken many harms losses benefits result
summarized slogan 'do violate trust'
exceptions rules two-step procedure gert holds moral rules absolute admit exceptions
determine whether moral rule applies certain case whether there exception gert advises people follow calls two step procedure
first step ascertain morally relevant information scenario hand order make justified evaluation
second step consider consequences other people knowing violate moral rule similar circumstances
example you consider violating rule #9 breaking law order run red light
you evaluate scenario notice there no cars around running red light will cause any harm however you want other people know run red lights too because lead car accidents indirectly causing pain death
another example violating moral rules killing self-defense
you evaluate situation you find you kill other person will violate moral rules kill you
also acceptable scenario other people know killing self-defense allowable
moral ideals moral ideals according gert objectives lessen amount harm evil world
these differ moral rules requirements people avoid performing certain kinds actions produce harms others
morality encourages does require people live up moral ideals
examples moral ideals objectives reducing incidence domestic violence breast cancer
gert calls utilitarian ideals objectives increase amount good world
example objective giving poor children extra presents christmas
categorizing gert's moral theory although moral system shares similarities deontology rule utilitarianism contractarianism gert does ally himself any those positions
writes think my view best characterized natural law theory
tradition hobbes
also writes my view characterized kant consequences mill publicity ross theory
however walter sinnott-armstrong once labeled theory sophisticated form negative objective universal public rule consequentialism gert replied there may no point denying am form consequentialist
