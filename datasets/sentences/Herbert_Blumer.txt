blumer played key role keeping tradition symbolic interactionism alive incorporating teachings university
presented articles symbolic interactionism single volume conceptualized symbolic interaction three main points humans act towards things including other individuals basis meanings them
there particular emphasis consciousness actors interpret their actions
important recognize meaning value object person may differ another person- sociologists should reduce human action social rules norms
blumer stresses point because fear our subjective meaning our actions overshadowed norms rules society meaning things arises out social interactions one's fellows
meaning something social product therefore inherent things
meanings handled modified through interpretive process person uses dealing things she encounters
meanings seen series interpretive actions actor
actor gives objects meanings act accordingly based these meanings then revises meanings guide future action
actor internal conversation himself determine meanings especially encountering something out ordinary
blumer believed creates society itself people engaging social interaction
follows then social reality exists context human experience
theory symbolic interaction argue thus closer theoretical framework based significance meanings interaction individuals applicable theory
according blumer's theory interaction individuals based autonomous action turn based subjective meaning actors attribute social objects and/or symbols
thus individual actors regulate their behavior based meaning attribute objects symbols their relevant situation
blumer theorized assigning objects meaning ongoing two-fold process
first identification objects situational meaning
second process internal communication decide meaningful object respond
acknowledging others equally autonomous individuals use their subjectively derived interpretations others social objects predict outcome certain behaviors use such predictive insight make decisions their own behavior hopes reaching their goal
thus there consensus among individual actors meaning objects make up their situation social coordination ensues
social structures determined much action individual actors determine action those individuals
based blumer believed society exists set potentials ideas people possibly use future
complex interaction meanings objects behaviors blumer reiterated uniquely human process because requires behavioral responses based interpretation symbols rather behavioral responses based environmental stimuli
social life fluid negotiated process understand each other humans must intrinsically engage symbolic interaction
blumer criticized contemporary social science day because instead using symbolic interactionism made false conclusions humans reducing human decisions social pressures like social positions roles
blumer invested psychical interactionism holds meanings symbols universal rather subjective “attached” symbols receiver depending how choose interpret them
blumer's 3 types objects importance thinking symbolic interactionists shown through their views objects
blumer defined objects things out there world
significance objects how defined actor
other words different objects different meanings depending individual
physical chair tree social student mother friend abstract ideas moral principals summary principles symbolic interactionism human beings capable thought
capacity thought shaped social interaction
learn meanings symbols through social interaction exercising human capacity thought
these meanings symbols provide basis distinctive human action interaction
modification meanings symbols occur through interpretation situations
humans' capability modification due their ability interact themselves
intertwining interaction action make up groups societies
methodological contributions sociology according herbert blumer most valid desirable social research conducted through qualitative ethnographic methodology
persistently critiqued idea form valid knowledge derived through totally objective perspective
blumer believed theoretical methodological approaches studying human behavior must acknowledge human beings thinking acting interacting individuals also must employ represent humanly known socially created experienced world
directly challenges thought process traditional positivism-based approach sociological method much controversy surrounds blumer’s sociological approach empirical research
blumer believed positivistic methods applied social research created results ignorant empirical realities social world
because people act towards world based subjective meanings attribute different objects symbolic interactionism individuals construct worlds inherently subjective
therefore objective analysis intrinsically subjugated researcher's own social reality documents researchers own grotesque personal assumptions social interaction ultimately yields bias findings
researcher truly understand sociological phenomena blumer asserted must understand their subject’s subjective interpretations reality
following logic blumer discounted social research blindly applies methods traditionally used natural sciences
such quantitative objective analysis argued does acknowledge difference humans animals specifically difference cognitive ability consciously entertain opinions apply meanings objects both enables humans take active role shaping their world
because society composed interactions individuals joint actions/transactions empirical reality stems human interaction
therefore contextual understanding human action intrinsic valid social research
thus blumer advocated sociological research sympathetically subjectively incorporates viewpoints subject therefore pushing micro-sociological approach
concluding there little validity research attempted understand social world objectively blumer felt objective interpretations society intrinsically bias researchers social location thus little empirical value
truthfully uncover social realities individuals different one's self observer must mindful their framework open different understanding social reality
macrostructures microstructures blumer believed society made up macrostructures rather essence society found microstructures specifically actors their actions
these microstructures isolated consist collective action combination giving rise concept joint action
joint action just sum individual actions takes character own
blumer reject idea macrostructures instead focused concept emergence-our larger social structures emerge smaller
blumer admitted macrostructures important extremely limited role symbolic interactionism
therefore argued macrostructures little “frameworks” within really important aspects social life action interaction take place
moreover according blumer macrostructures important because shape situations individuals act supply actors certain set symbols allow them act
also deny systems such culture social order
sum blumer large scale structures frameworks crucial society action interaction
denying social structures influence our actions just determine our actions
techniques blumer advocated direct observation social life interviewing listening people's conversations listening radio watching television reading newspapers reading diaries letter other written life histories reading public records finding well-informed participants sociological analysis variable 1952 herbert blumer became president american sociological association presidential address paper sociological analysis 'variable'
paper blumer addresses shortcomings variable analysis sees social research
herbert blumer says there conspicuous absence rules guides limitations prohibitions govern choice variables
overall felt variable analysis needed looked carefully precisely see variables correct connected social research hand
generic variables blumer does find generic frequent variable stands class object tied down given historical cultural situation
abstract sociological categories
example- social integration special set class terms
examples- age time authority blumer believed these shortcomings serious crucial increase experience overcome
address meant question how well does variable analysis suited study human group life fuller dimensions
blumer's criticisms thomas znaniecki 1939 blumer published critiques research social sciences appraisal thomas znaniecki's polish peasant europe america criticizing time popular social theory
blumer claimed thomas znaniecki failed properly distinguish attitude subjective value societal collective element
used terms interchangeably therefore making theory unreliable
difficult disentangle subjective factors objective correlates because objective world dealt extent enters subjective experiences
blumer scheme declares value playing upon pre-existing attitude gives rise new attitude attitude playing upon pre-existing value gives rise new value
terms uncertain clearly disjunctive presumed causal relation becomes suspect
conclusion blumer recognized society there no clear distinction attitude value even social theorists difficulty distinguishing two
collective behavior based work robert e
park blumer 1939 article called attention new subfield sociology collective behavior
now developed area inquiry devoted exploration collective action behavior yet organized under institutional structure formation
blumer particularly interested spontaneous collective coordination occurs something unpredicted disrupt standardized group behavior
saw combination events follows such phenomena key factor society's ongoing transformation
relationship george herbert mead blumer well known connection famous sociologist george herbert mead
blumer follower mead's work symbolic interactionism mead heavily influenced work
mead transferred subject field social psychology blumer
important aspect blumer learned mead order us understand meaning social actions must put ourselves others' shoes truly understand social symbols feel important
however blumer deviate mead's work
blumer proponent micro-focused approach sociology focused subjective consciousness symbolic meanings individuals
influence charles ellwood similar george mead sociologist charles ellwood also influenced development herbert blumer symbolic interactionism
there four prominent areas ellwood’s ideas found both blumer’s work symbolic interactionism interactionism methodology emotions group behavior
concepts “interstimulation response” “intercommunication” “coadaptation” function ellwood’s social psychology same way “self-indications” “interpretations” found blumer’s symbolic interactionism
there six areas ellwood blumer similar addressing methodology studying human behavior context disdain physical science method understanding people being studied using sociology assist humanity using inductive reasoning avoiding hypotheses
looking their ideas emotion both ellwood’s blumer’s ideas deal relationship emotion interaction ellwood stating our social life social behavior embedded feeling largely guided controlled feeling
similar blumer states feeling intrinsic every social attitude
both ellwood blumer social nominalists positioned reality reduced properties individuals their interrelations
scholarly critiques blumer many argued blumer’s theory simplified distorted version mead’s
many contemporary positions see “blumerian interactionism” “old hat“ because gender blind argued feminists too conservative
also contested symbolic interaction needs adopt agenda takes race class gender consideration
moreover argued social constructionist perspective blumerian interactionism provides “over-socialized” account human life downplays ignores our unconscious
theory symbolic interaction too subjective too much emphasis day-to-day life social formation individual while ignoring social structure
symbolic interactionism deflects attention away impact social structures like state culture economy individual behavior tended ignore class relations restraints brought differing social classes
perspective empirical research methodological contributions hard implement practice since blumer rejected behaviorist approach study meaning societal research within symbolic interactionist framework poses empirical challenges quotes full expanse human action isn't just following pre-established rules patterns
new situations arise constantly
repetitive standard actions just much product interpretative process ones based creative thinking
it's social action upholds rules rules uphold social action
new joint action arise out background previous actions
can't slice off given action historical linkages
nature object
consists meaning person whom object
concerning term self nothing esoteric meant expression
merely means human being object own action
acts towards himself guides himself actions towards others basis kind object himself
“it social process group life creates upholds rules rules create uphold group life
“a network institution does function automatically because inner dynamics system requirements functions because people different points something result how define situation called act
