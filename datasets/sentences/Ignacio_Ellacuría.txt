contents philosophy 2 theology 3 union science theology 4 chomsky ellacuría 5 references 6 selection ellacuría's publications 7 external links philosophy following references ellacuría's philosophy takes starting point xavier zubiri's 1898–1983 critique western philosophy
zubiri ever since parmenides western thought separated sensing intelligence
error led two results
first zubiri called logification intelligence second called entification reality
logification intelligence implied intellect reduced logos
view led philosophers believe called being cause reality turn explained confusion metaphysics ontology
logification intelligence excludes sensual logical functions intelligence
although zubiri recognized descriptive logos reason important components intelligence pointed out intelligence reduce itself them
zubiri intelligence unity modalities sensual apprehension logos reason
logification intelligence led perception reality being zone space time heidegger's dasein identifiable entities essence outside human brain
zubiri called entification reality
perception sees reality particular form being
thereby zubiri being substantivised western philosophy
zubiri reality paramount being noun verb
being particular aspect reality other way around
metaphysics studies reality ontology studies being
human beings' way accessing reality intelligence logified sentient intelligence itself part reality
senses logic reason intuition imagination same faculty because each these things determine another
faculty differences human beings other species achieved through evolution
having sentient intelligence implies having conscience possibility imagine new realities
these formulations themselves real postulation
realities postulation also realized other forms because sentient intelligence ability recognise processual structural character reality
therefore human beings able influence create transcend historical boundaries reached
zubiri there no need realist/anti-realist discussion there reality external independent human beings reality bulk internal illusions human beings
both sense critical realism pretends human beings seen reality separated objective outer reality
zubiri human beings imbedded reality cannot exist without
need air food water other beings
outer objective world must also come inside human beings them continue existing
sentient intelligence should able make sense existence way allows human beings realise their capabilities world
line thinking ellacuría human reality unavoidably personal social historical
biology society elements history means movement
should confused historical materialism says human beings passive instruments forces history
human beings certainly inherit constraints constructed past possibility transcend them because their sentient intelligence
praxis name ellacuría gives reflected human action aimed changing reality
unlike other animals respond mechanically stimuli outside through sentient intelligence praxis human beings realise their existence
individuals dialectic interaction society make out sort ego using their sentient intelligence implies transcending inherited constraints
means progress reality happens through combination physical biological praxical factors
through praxis human beings able realise wider range possibilities action
other words praxis lead wider complete form praxis
praxis contribute increase liberty liberty defined greater possibilities action
according ellacuría existence people marginalized society implies history practice delivered wider range possibilities realisation every human being world
situation prevented these excluded people realise their existence human beings
therefore situation stands away fullness humanity fullness reality
situation changed
ellacuría thought before evolution humanity further development historical reality took place physical biological forces
since development human beings praxis also contribute realise historical reality
since human beings possibility reflect philosophy's duty exercise ability reflect order change reality allow greater possibilities individual realisation
way thinking finds parallels 1990 s martha nussbaum's definition human development increase human capabilities action amartya sen's notion development freedom
theology following references many other theologians generation ellacuría intended construct new theology called historical theology
methodologically view history followed hegelian dialectic tradition culminated marx's historical materialism
however terms content also critical hegel's eurocentric view history
ellacuría rejected well marx's view human beings objects their material conditions
stressed importance conscience human praxis possibilities influencing course history thereby material conditions themselves
unfairly accused trying contaminate theology marxism methodological similarities thought marxism stem common hegelian view history progress brought overcoming contradictions
enrique dussel claim similarities liberation theology marx's thought confused mainstream interpretations go even beyond
found profound common origins narrative liberation judeo-christian tradition thought marx also shares
historical theology ellacuría meant way making theology reflect faith historical present reflect historical present faith
according theology conditioned historical present
historical theology intends acquire conscience historical context incorporate fully
concept locus theologicus theologogical place very important theology
rudolf bultmann developed existential biblical hermeneutics idea each individual read understand bible her personal existential condition biblical text acquires life awaken experience faith reader
generates hermeneutical circle since reader understands bible historical present historical present bible
ellacuría placed himself hermeneutic tradition gave step further
ellacuría reader just individual community just like people israel old testament
means community faith comes first then individual faith
according ellacuría value old testament reduced new testament
new testament makes community character faith old testament something radical universal
makes radical because establishes alliance god people much simple code laws lithurgical rituals invitation justice charity exceptional practices stable structure
why alliance established law
makes faith universal because new testament communicated every human being independently race culture sex religion social condition
liberation theology then new way doing historical theology particular locus theologicus historical present latin america large portion population oppressed structures deny them possibilities satisfy their needs develop
arises spirit gaudium et spes second vatican council social encyclicals pope john xxiii specifically episcopal conferences medellín 1968 puebla 1978
such reflection bible supported historical present collectivity desires liberation oppression
there long biblical tradition liberation starts book exodus
according ellacuría salvation accomplished historically just individually collectively
just liberation evil guilt personal social offenses pain disease fetichism
those forms liberation start liberation unjust structures like slavery political domination psychological social oppression
besides book exodus bible also presents other such cases liberation oppression return exile babylon books esdras nehemiah fight against macedonian occupation book maccabees beatitudes jesus book apocalypse face persecution christians rome
other forms doing historical theology example feminist theology african-american theology developed martin luther king fight civil rights united states african liberation theology mostly applied south africa fight against apartheid indigenous theology stems bartolomé de las casas other missionaries first spanish colonies americas 16 th century
union science theology ellacuría's commencement address santa clara university 1982 ellacuría aware challenges implied relating theology science
however managed articulate relationship two vision university served purpose liberating oppressed
according ellacuría there two aspects every university
most evident deals culture other words knowledge use sentient intellect
second evident must concerned social reality precisely because university inescapably social force must transform enlighten society lives
ellacuría believed university cannot every place same
must constantly look own peculiar historical reality
third world characterized oppression liberty poverty abundance
according ellacuría such context university must everything possible liberty overcomes oppression
added university must carry out general commitment means uniquely disposal
intellectual community university must analyse causes use imagination creativity together discover remedies problems communicate consciousness inspires freedom self-determination educate professionals conscience will immediate instruments such transformation constantly hone educational institution both academically excellent ethically oriented
ellacuría thought possible reason faith merge confronting reality poor
reason must open eyes their suffering while faith sees weak world salvation must mean conversion called
such university must take account preferential option poor
does mean poor will study university does mean university should abdicate mission academic excellence—excellence needed order solve complex social issues our time
does mean university should present intellectually needed provide science those without science provide skills those without skills voice those without voices give intellectual support those possess academic qualifications make their rights legitimate
chomsky ellacuría closer explanation your observation [eastern european dissidents] supported us vatican unlike dissidents elsewhere supported no any power influence
great understatement [eastern european dissidents] given massive support attention entire western world quite unprecedented support vastly greater support given people within western domains suffering far worse oppression defending freedom justice far greater courage
disparity extraordinary very word 'dissident' western languages refers east europeans no except those few extricated themselves western propaganda system even uses word 'dissident' people like central american jesuit intellectuals assassinated november 1989 elite forces armed trained us
while every word east european dissidents widely publicized hailed treasured try find even reference very important courageous writings fr
ellacuría associates other central american dissidents flee slaughter simply tortured killed us-run forces
