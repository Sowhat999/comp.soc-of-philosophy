early shinran's life parents both died
1181 desperate know happens after dying entered shoren-in temple near present-day maruyama park kyoto age 9
poem entering like cherry blossom heart planning tomorrow ephemeral indeed --what sudden storm may arise middle night
actually aware own impermanence desperate find solution
then practiced mt
hiei next 20 years life
letters wife daughter indicate tendai dōsō 堂僧? hall monk
because devotion practices lotus sutra mt
hiei became known prodigy mt
[citation needed] according own account wife eshinni whose letters preserved hongan-ji frustration own failures monk obtaining enlightenment took retreat temple rokkaku-dō
there while engaged intense practice experienced vision avalokitesvara appeared prince shōtoku directing shinran another disillusioned tendai monk named hōnen
1201 shinran met hōnen became disciple
during first year under honen's guidance age 29 shinran attained enlightenment salvation through amida's vow
though two knew each other few years hōnen entrusted shinran copy secret work senchakushū
however precise status amongst honen's followers unclear seven article pledge signed honen's followers 1204 shinran's signature appears near middle among less-intimate disciples
during time disciple honen's shinran caused great stir among society publicly getting married eating meat
both practices strictly forbidden monks shinran took these drastic steps show amida's salvation people just monks priests
1207 buddhist establishment kyoto persuaded military impose nembutsu ban after incident two hōnen's most prominent followers accused using nembutsu practice coverup sexual liaisons
these two monks subsequently executed
hōnen shinran exiled shinran being defrocked sent echigo province contemporary niigata prefecture
never met each other again
hōnen die later kyoto 1212
although shinran critical motivations ultimately led exile disruption hōnen's practice community exile itself proved critical turning point shinran's religious life
having stripped monastic name renamed himself gutoku 愚禿? foolish bald-headed coming understand himself neither monk nor layman
while exile shinran sought continue work hōnen spread doctrine salvation through amida buddha's compassion expressed through nembutsu practice however time teachings diverged hōnen enough later followers use term jōdo shinshū true [essence the] pure land sect opposed jōdo-shū pure land sect
shinran married wife eshinni six children her
five years after being exiled echigo 1211 nembutsu ban lifted shinran pardoned though chose return kyoto time
instead shinran left area known inada small area kantō just north tokyo
1224 shinran authored most significant text kyogyoshinsho series selections commentaries buddhist sutras supporting new pure land buddhist movement establishing doctrinal lineage buddhists thinkers india china
1234 shinran left kantō area returned kyoto daughter kakushinni
returning kyoto shinran discovered eldest son zenran 善鸞 1217 ? - 1286 ? remained hitachi shimotsuke provinces telling people received special teachings shinran otherwise leading people astray
shinran stern letters zenran frequently addressed buddhist name jishin-bō 慈信房? instructing cease activities zenran refused shinran disowned hence now there shall no longer exist parental relations you cease consider you my son
declare resolutely three treasures gods
sorrowful thing
rends my heart hear you devoted yourself misleading people nembutsu hitachi saying [what taught] my true teaching
rumors reached far kamakura instructed you denounce people hitachi say nembutsu
deeply deplorable
shinran died kyoto year 1263 age 90
kakushinni instrumental maintaining mausoleum passing teachings her descendants ultimately becoming monshu head honganji temples built around mausoleum

according letter composed wife eshinni people say types things master [hōnen] might go
even say headed evil rebirth akudō
whenever people spoke such things [shinran] reply am believes even go [with him] since realm realm rebirth rebirth am lost already
honen's disciples largely divided questions arising need single invocation nenbutsu amitabha's name versus many-callings thereby emphasis faith versus practice
shinran like honen's disciple kōsai leaned toward faith over practice however advocate single-recitation teaching
while shinran's teachings beliefs generally consistent pure land buddhist movement time also idiosyncrasies well primacy faith any case shinran like others honen's community felt age dharma decline no longer possible achieve enlightenment through traditional monastic practices thus rely vows amitabha buddha particular 18 th primal vow seek rebirth pure land
passage magnum opus kyōgyōshinshō writes himself therefore reverencing expositions treatise masters relying exhortations religious teachers bald-headed fool shinran abandoned forever provisional path manifold practices good work separated myself once birth forest twin śāla trees
turned true path basis virtue good gave rise aspiration birth [in pure land] difficult comprehend
now utterly abandoned expediency true path converted ocean-like vow singled out [by amitabha buddha]
separated myself straightaway aspiration birth difficult comprehend long attain birth difficult fathom
passage shinran explains gave up traditional monastic practices focus rebirth pure land time eventually gave up practices related rebirth pure land instead relying solely faith vow amitabha buddha
kyōgyōshinshō third fascicle shinran explores nature shinjitsu no shinjin 真実の信心 true faith? describing something bestowed amitabha buddha arising believer
through endowment faith awakened person recitation buddha's name nembutsu because expression praise gratitude
however cannot occur until believer fully entrusts themselves amitabha buddha even moment
once state faith bestowed assured rebirth pure land ultimately enlightenment
shinran cautions though true faith necessarily entails amida's name amida's name does necessarily entail faith [which derived] power [amida's] vow
further once follower awakened deep faith should live life expression gratitude follow basic moral conduct fulfill one's social obligations
amitabha buddha pure land last three fascicles kyōgyōshinshō delve nature amitabha buddha pure land
pure land treated temporary refuge whereby attain enlightenment then return world lead teach others bodhisattva
elsewhere shinran quoted tannishō 歎異抄? lamentation divergences saying 浄土の慈悲といふは、念仏して、いそぎ仏になりて、大慈大悲心をもて、おもふがごとく衆生を利益するをいふべきなり。 jōdo no jihi iu no wa nenbutsu shite isogi hotoke ni narite daiji-daihi-shin wo mote omou ga gotoku shujō wo rieki suru wo iu beki nari
compassion path pure land quickly attain buddhahood saying nembutsu true heart compassion love save beings completely desire
nature amitabha buddha shinran stated their true form both buddha pure land beyond comprehension due people's ignorance attachments perceive amitabha terms physical form described sutras well layout pure land
attains true faith then upon rebirth pure land perceive their true form
however one's faith incomplete continue rely their own efforts then will reborn outer regions pure land will still perceive amitabha buddha through physical forms until eventually attaining true faith proceeding further
shinran's definition amitabha buddha absolute equating pure land nirvana itself therefore differed somewhat traditional interpretations pure land buddhist scripture
age dharma decline shinran's interpretation final age dharma consistent other buddhist thinkers time
particular drew inspiration chinese buddhist master named tao-cho centuries earlier taught latter age dharma pure land teachings most suitable capacities people time
shinran felt decline inevitable japan already 600 years age dharma decline people no longer capable maintaining buddhist practice let alone enlightenment
thus vow amitabha buddha save beings relied upon
other religious practices shinran acknowledged religious practices japan outside buddhist tradition including shinto kami spirits divination astrology etc
believed irrelevant comparison power amitabha buddha
