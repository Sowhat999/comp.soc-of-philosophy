metaphysics mostly found principal book subject god speaks
contains detailed statements cosmology purpose life well progression soul while elucidations practical spiritual life mostly contained discourses although also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring amplifying god speaks
god speaks main article god speaks god speaks meher baba describes journey soul original state unconscious divinity ultimate attainment conscious divinity
whole journey journey imagination original indivisible state god imagines becoming countless individualized souls likens bubbles within infinite ocean
each soul powered desire become conscious starts journey most rudimentary form consciousness
limitation brings need developed form advance towards increasingly conscious state
consciousness grows relation impressions each form capable gathering
according baba each soul pursues conscious divinity evolving experiencing itself succession imagined forms through seven kingdoms stone/metal vegetable worm fish bird animal human
soul identifies itself each successive form becoming thus tied illusion
during evolution forms thinking also increases until human form thinking becomes infinite
although human form soul capable conscious divinity impressions gathered during evolution illusory ones creating barrier soul know itself
barrier overcome further births human form needed process named reincarnation
eventually soul reaches stage previously gathered impressions grow thin weak enough enters final stage called involution
stage also requires series human births during soul begins inner journey realizes true identity god
baba breaks inner journey realization seven stages calls planes
whole process culminates seventh plane god-realization goal life individual soul reached
discourses main article discourses meher baba discourses collection explanations elucidations meher baba given many topics concern advancement spiritual aspirant
most important topics treated sanskaras mental impressions maya principle illusion nature ego reincarnation karma violence non-violence meditation love discipleship god-realization
explanations often include stories lore india sufi culture
such story wise man ghost shows power superstitious beliefs person while another majnun layla show how selfless love even human relations lead discipleship
