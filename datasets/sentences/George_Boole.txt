later regarded flawed exposition logical system wanted investigation laws thought founded mathematical theories logic probabilities seen mature statement views
contrary widespread belief boole never intended criticise disagree main principles aristotle's logic
rather intended systematise provide foundation extend range applicability
boole's initial involvement logic prompted current debate quantification sir william hamilton supported theory quantification predicate boole's supporter augustus de morgan advanced version de morgan duality now called
boole's approach ultimately much further reaching either sides' controversy
founded first known algebra logic tradition
among many innovations principle wholistic reference later probably independently adopted gottlob frege logicians subscribe standard first-order logic

1854 definition universe discourse every discourse whether mind conversing own thoughts individual intercourse others there assumed expressed limit within subjects operation confined
most unfettered discourse words use understood widest possible application them limits discourse co-extensive those universe itself
usually confine ourselves less spacious field
sometimes discoursing men imply without expressing limitation men under certain circumstances conditions speak civilised men men vigour life men under other condition relation
now whatever may extent field within objects our discourse found field may properly termed universe discourse
furthermore universe discourse strictest sense ultimate subject discourse
treatment addition logic boole conceived elective symbols kind algebraic structure
general concept available segregation standard abstract algebra postulated axiomatic properties operations deduced properties
work beginning algebra sets again concept available boole familiar model
pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties treatment addition obvious difficulty early days
boole replaced operation multiplication word 'and' addition word 'or'
boole's original system + partial operation language set theory correspond disjoint union subsets
later authors changed interpretation commonly reading exclusive set theory terms symmetric difference step means addition defined
fact there other possibility + should read disjunction other possibility extends disjoint union case exclusive non-exclusive both give same answer
handling ambiguity early problem theory reflecting modern use both boolean rings boolean algebras simply different aspects type structure
boole jevons struggled over just issue 1863 form correct evaluation x + x
jevons argued result x correct + disjunction
boole kept result something undefined
argued against result 0 correct exclusive because saw equation x + x = 0 implying x = 0 false analogy ordinary algebra
probability theory second part laws thought contained corresponding attempt discover general method probabilities
here goal algorithmic given probabilities any system events determine consequent probability any other event logically connected those events

1921 economist john maynard keynes published book probability theory treatise probability
keynes believed boole made fundamental error definition independence vitiated much analysis
book last challenge problem david miller provides general method accord boole's system attempts solve problems recognised earlier keynes others
theodore hailperin showed much earlier boole used correct mathematical definition independence worked out problems boole's work later logicians initially appeared no engineering uses
claude shannon attended philosophy class university michigan introduced boole's studies
shannon recognised boole's work form basis mechanisms processes real world therefore highly relevant
1937 shannon went write master's thesis massachusetts institute technology showed how boolean algebra optimise design systems electromechanical relays then used telephone routing switches
also proved circuits relays solve boolean algebra problems
employing properties electrical switches process logic basic concept underlies modern electronic digital computers
victor shestakov moscow state university 1907–1987 proposed theory electric switches based boolean logic even earlier claude shannon 1935 testimony soviet logicians mathematicians sofya yanovskaya gaaze-rapoport roland dobrushin lupanov medvedev uspensky though presented their academic theses same year 1938
[clarification needed] first publication shestakov's result took place 1941 russian
hence boolean algebra became foundation practical digital circuit design boole via shannon shestakov provided theoretical grounding information age
