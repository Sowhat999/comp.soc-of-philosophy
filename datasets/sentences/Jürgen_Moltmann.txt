moltmann also developed interest luther hegel former whose doctrine justification theology cross interested greatly
doctoral supervisor otto weber helped develop eschatological perspective church's universal mission
moltmann cites english pacifist anti-capitalist theologian geoffrey anketell studdert kennedy being highly regarded
however inspiration first major work theology hope marxist philosopher ernst bloch's principle hope
bloch concerned establish hope guiding principle marxism stresses implied humanism inherent mystical tradition
bloch claims identify atheism core christianity embodied notion death god continued imperative seeking kingdom
whole theme theology hope worked out counterpoint theology wolfhart pannenberg worked alongside moltmann wuppertal also undergone conversion experience during germany's defeat world war ii
slogan history revelation pannenberg's theology many parallels moltmann concerned reject any notion history closed system shift stress revelation action hope principle revolutionary openness future
background influence these thinkers hegel referenced times any other writer theology hope
like left hegelians immediately succeeded master both moltmann pannenberg determined retain sense history meaningful central christian discourse while avoiding essentially conformist conservative aspects thought
doing wrestling history germany itself
also implicitly offering critique neo-orthodox theology karl barth emil brunner see ahistorical core

altizer memory paul tillich
title moltmann's crucial work however derived nietzsche martin luther use marked renewed engagement specifically lutheran strain protestant theology opposed calvinist tenor earlier work
moltmann's widening interest theological perspectives broad cultural arena evident use book kazoh kitamori theology pain god kitamori 1946 relates bonhoeffer's prison reflections

theology early moltmann seen trilogy theology hope 1964 crucified god 1972 church power spirit 1975 theology hope strongly influenced eschatological orientation marxist philosopher ernst bloch's principle hope
crucified god posited god died cross raising question impassibility god
church power spirit explores implications these explorations church own life world
later moltmann took less systematic approach theology leading called systematic contributions theology sought provoke engage develop kind set moltmannian theology
moltmann corroborates ideas those catholics orthodox christians jews attempt reach greater understanding christian theology believes should developed inter-ecumenically
moltmann passion kingdom god exists both future god present
theology often referred kingdom god theology
theology built eschatology hope found resurrected christ
theology most clearly explained book theology hope
moltmann's theology also seen theology liberation though sense term most understood
moltmann views salvation christ's preferential option poor also offering hope reconciliation oppressors poor
such divine reconciliation insufficient
according moltmann future final volume ‘systematic contributions theology’ will published probably under title kingdom god theology focused foundations methods theology
thus sixth volume will helpful concern theological method
however fact moltmann interested content theology revision light biblical origin innovation given challenges present rather questions theological method meeks 1996103
addition development theologian marked restless imagination
eschatology / theology hope moltmann's theology hope theological perspective eschatological foundation focuses hope resurrection brings
through faith bound christ such hope resurrected christ praise god father our lord jesus christ! great mercy given us new birth living hope through resurrection jesus christ dead peter 13 niv knowledge return
moltmann hope christian faith hope resurrection christ crucified
hope faith depend each other remain true substantial both may find consolation suffering also protest divine promise against suffering however because hope hold may never exist harmoniously society such ours based sin
following theology hope christian should find hope future also experience much discontentment way world now corrupt full sin
sin bases itself hopelessness take two forms presumption despair
presumption premature selfwilled anticipation fulfillment hope god
despair premature arbitrary anticipation non-fulfillment hope god
moltmann's opinion should seen eschatological perspective looking toward days christ will make things new
proper theology therefore constructed light future goal
eschatology should end beginning
does many fear 'remove happiness present' focusing ones attention toward hope christ's return
moltmann addresses concern such does hope cheat man happiness present? how so! itself happiness present
importance current times necessary theology hope because brings future events here now
theological perspective eschatology makes hope future hope today
hope strengthens faith aids believer living life love directing them toward new creation things
creates believer passion possible our knowledge comprehension reality our reflections means least medium hope our theological concepts become judgments nail reality down anticipations show reality prospects future possibilities
passion centered around hope resurrected returning christ creating change within believer drives change believer seeks make world
moltmann creation eschatology depend another
there exists ongoing process creation continuing creation alongside creation ex nihilo consummation creation
consummation creation will consist eschatological transformation creation new creation
apocalypse will include purging sin our finite world transformed humanity participate new creation
liberation theology moltmann's liberation theology includes understanding both oppressed oppressor needing reconciliation
oppression two sides side there master other side slave
oppression destroys humanity both sides
goal mutual liberation
god's 'preferential option poor' should exclusive rather include rich insofar god holds judgment over them also
sufferings poor should seen equal representation sufferings jesus
our suffering offering god required us suffer
point crucified christ present alternative human suffering
human suffering quality salvation should viewed such
say sufferings humans no importance god
trinitarian theology moltmann stresses perichoresis father son holy spirit
say believes three dwell another
three persons differentiated their characteristics related their original exchange
moltmann seeks defeat monotheistic christianity being used tool political clerical absolute monarchism
believes doctrine trinity should developed true theological doctrine freedom
suggests cease understand god monotheistically absolute subject instead see trinitarian sense unity father son spirit
moltmann relates views trinity three modes human freedom
first mode political meaning freedom supremacy
mode rejected moltmann sees corresponding god rules over creation exists merely serve
relation subject object goal enhance supremacy subject
second mode human freedom socio-historical hegelian meaning freedom communion implies relation two subjects
relationship aims love solidarity corresponds perichoresis father son through son children god humanity
relationship both liberating loving moltmann favors
third mode human freedom implicitly religious concept freedom passion creature her potential
deals relationship subjects their common future project
mode favored most moltmann correlates relationship humans share god realm holy spirit
here indwelling spirit allows humans friends god
you see first mode freedom political focuses father second communal focusing son third religious focusing spirit
