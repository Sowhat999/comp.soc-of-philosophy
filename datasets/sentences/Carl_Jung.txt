thought though practicing clinician considered himself scientist much life's work spent exploring tangential areas such eastern western philosophy alchemy astrology sociology well literature arts
jung's interest philosophy occult led many view mystic although ambition seen man science
introversion extraversion main article introversion extraversion jung first people define introversion extraversion psychological context
jung’s psychological types theorizes each person falls two categories introvert extravert
these two psychological types jung compares ancient archetypes apollo dionysus
introvert likened apollo shines light understanding
introvert focused internal world reflection dreaming vision
thoughtful insightful introvert sometimes uninterested joining activities others
extravert associated dionysus interested joining activities world
extravert focused outside world objects sensory perception action
energetic lively extrovert may lose their sense self intoxication dionysian pursuits
jungian introversion extraversion quite different modern idea introversion extroversion
modern theories often stay true behaviourist means describing such trait sociability talkativeness assertiveness etc
whereas jungian introversion extraversion expressed perspective introverts interpret world subjectively whereas extraverts interpret world objectively
individuation jung considered individuation psychological process integrating opposites including conscious unconscious while still maintaining their relative autonomy necessary person become whole
individuation process transformation whereby personal collective unconscious brought consciousness means dreams active imagination free association take examples assimilated whole personality
completely natural process necessary integration psyche take place
besides achieving physical mental health people advanced towards individuation tend harmonious mature responsible
embody humane values such freedom justice good understanding workings human nature universe
persona see also persona psychology psychological theory necessarily linked particular theory social structure persona appears consciously created personality identity fashioned out part collective psyche through socialization acculturation experience
jung applied term persona explicitly because latin means both personality masks worn roman actors classical period expressive individual roles played
persona argues mask collective psyche mask 'pretends' individuality both self others believe identity even really no well-played role through collective psyche expressed
jung regarded persona-mask complicated system mediates individual consciousness social community compromise individual society man should appear
also makes quite explicit substance character mask classical sense known theatre double function both intended make certain impression others hide part true nature individual
therapist then aims assist individuation process through client regains own self liberating self both deceptive cover persona power unconscious impulses
jung's theory become enormously influential management theory just because managers executives create appropriate management persona corporate mask persuasive identity also because evaluate sort people workers order manage them example using personality tests peer reviews
spirituality jung's work himself patients convinced life spiritual purpose beyond material goals
our main task believed discover fulfill our deep innate potential
based study christianity hinduism buddhism gnosticism taoism other traditions jung believed journey transformation called individuation mystical heart religions
journey meet self same time meet divine
unlike freud's objectivist worldview jung's pantheism may led believe spiritual experience essential our well-being specifically identifies individual human life universe whole
jung's ideas religion gave counterbalance freudian scepticism religion
jung's idea religion practical road individuation quite popular still treated modern textbooks psychology religion though ideas also criticized
jung recommended spirituality cure alcoholism considered indirect role establishing alcoholics anonymous
jung once treated american patient rowland hazard iii suffering chronic alcoholism
after working patient time achieving no significant progress jung man alcoholic condition near hopeless save possibility spiritual experience
jung noted occasionally such experiences known reform alcoholics else failed
hazard took jung's advice seriously set seeking personal spiritual experience
returned home united states joined first-century christian evangelical movement known oxford group later known moral re-armament
also other alcoholics jung importance spiritual experience
alcoholics brought oxford group ebby thacher long-time friend drinking buddy bill wilson later co-founder alcoholics anonymous aa
thacher wilson oxford group through them wilson became aware hazard's experience jung
influence jung thus indirectly found way formation alcoholics anonymous original twelve-step program there whole twelve-step recovery movement although aa whole jungian jung no role formation approach twelve steps
above claims documented letters jung bill wilson excerpts found pass published alcoholics anonymous
although detail story disputed historians jung himself discussed oxford group member may same person talks given around 1940
remarks distributed privately transcript form shorthand taken attender jung reportedly approved transcript later recorded volume 18 collected works symbolic life instance member oxford group comes me order get treatment say 'you oxford group long you there you settle your affair oxford group

alchemy work writings jung 1940 s onwards focused alchemy
1944 jung published psychology alchemy analyzed alchemical symbols came conclusion there direct relationship them psychoanalytical process
[b] argued alchemical process transformation impure soul lead perfected soul gold metaphor individuation process
1963 mysterium coniunctionis first appeared english part collected works c
mysterium coniunctionis jung's last book focused mysterium coniunctionis archetype known sacred marriage sun moon
jung argued stages alchemists blackening whitening reddening yellowing taken symbolic individuation — favourite term personal growth 75
art therapy jung proposed art used alleviate contain feelings trauma fear anxiety also repair restore heal
work patients own personal explorations jung art expression images found dreams helpful recovering trauma emotional distress
often drew painted made objects constructions times emotional distress recognized recreational
political views views state jung stressed importance individual rights person's relation state society
saw state treated quasi-animate personality whom everything expected personality camouflage those individuals know how manipulate referred state form slavery
also thought state swallowed up [people's] religious forces therefore state taken place god—making comparable religion state slavery form worship
jung observed stage acts [the] state comparable religious displays brass bands flags banners parades monster demonstrations no different principle ecclesiastical processions cannonades fire scare off demons
jung's perspective replacement god state mass society led dislocation religious drive resulted same fanaticism church-states dark ages—wherein state 'worshipped' freedom morality suppressed ultimately leaves individual psychically undeveloped extreme feelings marginalization
