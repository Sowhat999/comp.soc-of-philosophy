work quine's ph
thesis early publications formal logic set theory
after world war ii virtue seminal papers ontology epistemology language emerge major philosopher
1960 s worked out naturalized epistemology whose aim answer substantive questions knowledge meaning using methods tools natural sciences
quine roundly rejected notion there should first philosophy theoretical standpoint somehow prior natural science capable justifying
these views intrinsic naturalism
quine lecture french spanish portuguese german well native english
like logical positivists evinced little interest philosophical canon once teach course history philosophy hume
[clarification needed] rejection analytic–synthetic distinction see also two dogmas empiricism 1930 s 1940 s discussions rudolf carnap nelson goodman alfred tarski among others led quine doubt tenability distinction analytic statements—those true simply meanings their words such bachelors unmarried—and synthetic statements those true false virtue facts world such there cat mat
distinction central logical positivism
although quine normally associated verificationism philosophers believe tenet incompatible general philosophy language citing harvard colleague
skinner analysis language verbal behavior
like other analytic philosophers before quine accepted definition analytic true virtue meaning alone
unlike them however concluded ultimately definition circular
other words quine accepted analytic statements those true definition then argued notion truth definition unsatisfactory
criticism kant's epistemology similar 18 th century writer johann gottfried herder both individuals found fault kantian system sufficiently accounting dependence reasoning language
quine's chief objection analyticity notion synonymy sameness meaning sentence being analytic just case substitutes synonym black proposition like black things black any other logical truth
objection synonymy hinges upon problem collateral information
intuitively feel there distinction unmarried men bachelors there black dogs competent english speaker will assent both sentences under conditions since such speakers also access collateral information bearing historical existence black dogs
quine maintains there no distinction universally known collateral information conceptual analytic truths
another approach quine's objection analyticity synonymy emerges modal notion logical possibility
traditional wittgensteinian view meaning held each meaningful sentence associated region space possible worlds
[citation needed] quine finds notion such space problematic arguing there no distinction those truths universally confidently believed those necessarily true
confirmation holism ontological relativity central theses underlying indeterminacy translation other extensions quine's work ontological relativity related doctrine confirmation holism
premise confirmation holism theories propositions derived them under-determined empirical data data sensory-data evidence although theories justifiable failing fit data being unworkably complex there many equally justifiable alternatives
while greeks' assumption unobservable homeric gods exist false our supposition unobservable electromagnetic waves true both justified solely their ability explain our observations
quine concluded two dogmas empiricism follows empiricist continue think conceptual scheme science tool ultimately predicting future experience light past experience
physical objects conceptually imported situation convenient intermediaries definition terms experience simply irreducible posits comparable epistemologically gods homer
my part qua lay physicist believe physical objects homer's gods consider scientific error believe otherwise
point epistemological footing physical objects gods differ degree kind
both sorts entities enter our conceptions cultural posits
quine's ontological relativism evident passage above led agree pierre duhem any collection empirical evidence there many theories able account
however duhem's holism much restricted limited quine's
duhem underdetermination applies physics possibly natural science while quine applies human knowledge
thus while possible verify falsify whole theories possible verify falsify individual statements
almost any particular statement saved given sufficiently radical modifications containing theory
quine scientific thought forms coherent web any part altered light empirical evidence no empirical evidence force revision given part
quine's writings led wide acceptance instrumentalism philosophy science
existence contrary problem non-referring names old puzzle philosophy quine captured curious thing ontological problem simplicity
put three anglo-saxon monosyllables 'what there?' answered moreover word—'everything'—and everyone will accept answer true
directly controversy goes how talk pegasus? does word 'pegasus' refer? our answer 'something' then seem believe mystical entities our answer 'nothing' then seem talk nothing sense made this? certainly pegasus mythological winged horse make sense moreover speak truth! speak truth must truth something
cannot speaking nothing
quine resists temptation say non-referring terms meaningless reasons made clear above
instead tells us must first determine whether our terms refer before know proper way understand them
however czesław lejewski criticizes belief reducing matter empirical discovery seems should formal distinction referring non-referring terms elements our domain
lejewski writes further state affairs does seem very satisfactory
idea our rules inference should depend empirical information may forthcoming foreign character logical inquiry thorough re-examination two inferences [existential generalization universal instantiation] may prove worth our while
lejewski then goes offer description free logic claims accommodates answer problem
lejewski also points out free logic additionally handle problem empty set statements like
quine considered problem empty set unrealistic left lejewski unsatisfied
logic over course career quine published numerous technical expository papers formal logic reprinted selected logic papers ways paradox
quine confined logic classical bivalent first-order logic hence truth falsity under any nonempty universe discourse
hence following logic quine higher order logic set theory
referred higher order logic set theory disguise much principia mathematica included logic logic quine
formal systems involving intensional notions especially modality
quine especially hostile modal logic quantification battle largely lost saul kripke's relational semantics became canonical modal logics
quine three undergraduate texts formal logic elementary logic
while teaching introductory course 1940 quine discovered extant texts philosophy students justice quantification theory first-order predicate logic
quine book 6 weeks ad hoc solution teaching needs
methods logic
four editions book resulted advanced undergraduate course logic quine taught end world war ii until 1978 retirement
philosophy logic
concise witty undergraduate treatment number quinian themes such prevalence use-mention confusions dubiousness quantified modal logic non-logical character higher-order logic
mathematical logic based quine's graduate teaching during 1930 s 40 s
shows much principia mathematica took 1000 pages say 250 pages
proofs concise even cryptic
last chapter gödel's incompleteness theorem tarski's indefinability theorem along article quine 1946 became launching point raymond smullyan's later lucid exposition these related results
quine's work logic gradually became dated respects
techniques teach discuss include analytic tableaux recursive functions model theory
treatment metalogic left something desired
example mathematical logic does include any proofs soundness completeness
early career notation writings logic often idiosyncratic
later writings nearly employed now-dated notation principia mathematica
set against simplicity preferred method exposited methods logic determining satisfiability quantified formulas richness philosophical linguistic insights fine prose expressed them
most quine's original work formal logic 1960 onwards variants predicate functor logic several ways proposed doing logic without quantifiers
comprehensive treatment predicate functor logic history see quine 1976
introduction see chpt
methods logic
quine very warm possibility formal logic eventually applied outside philosophy mathematics
several papers sort boolean algebra employed electrical engineering edward j
mc cluskey devised quine–mc cluskey algorithm reducing boolean equations minimum covering sum prime implicants
set theory while contributions logic include elegant expositions number technical results set theory quine most innovative
maintained mathematics required set theory set theory quite distinct logic
flirted nelson goodman's nominalism while backed away failed find nominalist grounding mathematics
over course career quine proposed three variants axiomatic set theory each including axiom extensionality new foundations nf creates manipulates sets using single axiom schema set admissibility namely axiom schema stratified comprehension whereby individuals satisfying stratified formula compose set
stratified formula type theory allow ontology include types
however quine's set theory does feature types
metamathematics nf curious
nf allows many large sets now-canonical zfc set theory does allow even sets axiom choice does hold
since axiom choice holds finite sets failure axiom nf proves nf includes infinite sets
relative consistency nf open question
modification nf nfu due r
jensen admitting urelements entities members sets lack elements turns out consistent relative peano arithmetic thus vindicating intuition behind nf
nf nfu quinian set theories following
derivation foundational mathematics nf see rosser 1952 set theory mathematical logic nf augmented proper classes von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory except axiomatized much simpler way set theory set theory logic does away stratification almost entirely derived single axiom schema
quine derived foundations mathematics once again
book includes definitive exposition quine's theory virtual sets relations surveyed axiomatic set theory stood circa 1960
however fraenkel bar-hillel levy 1973 better job surveying set theory stood mid-century
three set theories admit universal class since free any hierarchy types no need distinct universal class each type level
quine's set theory background logic driven desire minimize posits each innovation pushed far pushed before further innovations introduced
quine there connective sheffer stroke quantifier universal quantifier
polyadic predicates reduced dyadic predicate interpretable set membership
rules proof limited modus ponens substitution
preferred conjunction either disjunction conditional because conjunction least semantic ambiguity

5 logical point view
quine's epistemology just challenged dominant analytic–synthetic distinction quine also took aim traditional normative epistemology
according quine traditional epistemology tried justify sciences effort exemplified rudolf carnap failed should replace traditional epistemology empirical study sensory inputs produce theoretical outputs
epistemology something like simply falls place chapter psychology hence natural science
studies natural phenomenon viz
physical human subject
human subject accorded certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns irradiation assorted frequencies instance — fullness time subject delivers output description three-dimensional external world history
relation meager input torrential output relation prompted study somewhat same reasons prompted epistemology namely order see how evidence relates theory ways one's theory nature transcends any available evidence
conspicuous difference old epistemology epistemological enterprise new psychological setting now make free use empirical psychology
