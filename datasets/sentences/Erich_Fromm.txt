while fromm maintained own clinical practice published series books
psychological theory beginning first seminal work 1941 escape freedom known britain fear freedom fromm's writings notable much their social political commentary their philosophical psychological underpinnings
indeed escape freedom viewed founding works political psychology
second important work man himself inquiry psychology ethics first published 1947 continued enriched ideas escape freedom
taken together these books outlined fromm's theory human character natural outgrowth fromm's theory human nature
fromm's most popular book art loving international bestseller first published 1956 recapitulated complemented theoretical principles human nature found escape freedom man himself—principles revisited many fromm's other major works
central fromm's world view interpretation talmud hasidism
began studying talmud young man under rabbi j
horowitz later under rabbi salman baruch rabinkow chabad hasid
while working towards doctorate sociology university heidelberg fromm studied tanya founder chabad rabbi shneur zalman liadi
fromm also studied under nehemia nobel ludwig krause while studying frankfurt
fromm's grandfather two great grandfathers father's side rabbis great uncle mother's side noted talmudic scholar
however fromm turned away orthodox judaism 1926 towards secular interpretations scriptural ideals
cornerstone fromm's humanistic philosophy interpretation biblical story adam eve's exile garden eden
drawing knowledge talmud fromm pointed out being able distinguish good evil generally considered virtue biblical scholars generally consider adam eve sinned disobeying god eating tree knowledge
however departing traditional religious orthodoxy fromm extolled virtues humans taking independent action using reason establish moral values rather adhering authoritarian moral values
beyond simple condemnation authoritarian value systems fromm used story adam eve allegorical explanation human biological evolution existential angst asserting adam eve ate tree knowledge became aware themselves being separate nature while still being part
why felt naked ashamed evolved human beings conscious themselves their own mortality their powerlessness before forces nature society no longer united universe their instinctive pre-human existence animals
according fromm awareness disunited human existence source guilt shame solution existential dichotomy found development one's uniquely human powers love reason
however fromm distinguished concept love unreflective popular notions well freudian paradoxical love see criticism marcuse below
fromm considered love interpersonal creative capacity rather emotion distinguished creative capacity considered various forms narcissistic neuroses sado-masochistic tendencies commonly held out proof true love
indeed fromm viewed experience falling love evidence one's failure understand true nature love believed common elements care responsibility respect knowledge
drawing knowledge torah fromm pointed story jonah wish save residents nineveh consequences their sin demonstrative belief qualities care responsibility generally absent most human relationships
fromm also asserted few people modern society respect autonomy their fellow human beings much less objective knowledge other people truly wanted needed
fromm believed freedom aspect human nature either embrace escape
observed embracing our freedom will healthy whereas escaping freedom through use escape mechanisms root psychological conflicts
fromm outlined three most common escape mechanisms automaton conformity authoritarianism destructiveness
automaton conformity changing one's ideal self conform perception society's preferred type personality losing one's true self process
automaton conformity displaces burden choice self society
authoritarianism giving control oneself another
submitting one's freedom someone else act removes freedom choice almost entirely
lastly destructiveness any process attempts eliminate others world whole escape freedom
fromm destruction world last almost desperate attempt save myself being crushed
word biophilia frequently used fromm description productive psychological orientation state being
example addendum book heart man genius good evil fromm part humanist credo believe man choosing progress find new unity through development human forces produced three orientations
these presented separately together biophilia love humanity nature independence freedom
erich fromm postulated eight basic needs relatedness relationships others care respect knowledge
transcendence being thrown world without their consent humans transcend their nature destroying creating people things
humans destroy through malignant aggression killing reasons other survival also create care their creations
rootedness rootedness need establish roots feel home again world
productively rootedness enables us grow beyond security our mother establish ties outside world
nonproductive strategy become fixated afraid move beyond security safety our mother mother substitute
sense identity drive sense identity expressed nonproductively conformity group productively individuality
frame orientation understanding world our place
excitation stimulation actively striving goal rather simply responding
unity sense oneness person natural human world outside
effectiveness need feel accomplished
fromm's thesis escape freedom epitomized following passage
individualized man referenced fromm man bereft primary ties belonging
nature family etc
also expressed freedom there possible productive solution relationship individualized man world active solidarity men spontaneous activity love work unite again world primary ties free independent individual
however economic social political conditions
offer basis realization individuality sense just mentioned while same time people lost those ties gave them security lag makes freedom unbearable burden
then becomes identical doubt kind life lacks meaning direction
powerful tendencies arise escape kind freedom submission kind relationship man world promises relief uncertainty even deprives individual freedom

five basic orientations book man himself fromm spoke orientation character
differentiates theory character freud focusing two ways individual relates world
freud analyzed character terms libido organization whereas fromm says process living relate world acquiring assimilating things—assimilation 2 reacting people—socialization
fromm asserted these two ways relating world instinctive individual's response peculiar circumstances her life also believed people never exclusively type orientation
these two ways relating life's circumstances lead basic character-orientations
lists four types nonproductive character orientation called receptive exploitative hoarding marketing positive character orientation called productive
receptive exploitative orientations basically how individual may relate other people socialization attributes character
hoarding orientation acquiring assimilating materials/valuables character trait
marketing orientation arises response human situation modern era
current needs market determine value
relativistic ethic
contrast productive orientation objective ethic
despite existential struggles humanity each human potential love reason productive work life
fromm writes paradox human existence man must simultaneously seek closeness independence oneness others same time preservation uniqueness particularity
answer paradox - moral problems man - productiveness

critique freud fromm examined life work sigmund freud length
identified discrepancy early later freudian theory namely prior world war freud described human drives tension desire repression after war's conclusion framed human drives struggle biologically universal life death eros thanatos instincts
fromm charged freud followers never acknowledging contradictions two theories
also criticized freud's dualistic thinking
according fromm freudian descriptions human consciousness struggles two poles narrow limiting
fromm also condemned misogynist unable think outside patriarchal milieu early 20 th century vienna
however fromm expressed great respect freud accomplishments spite these criticisms
fromm contended freud architects modern age alongside albert einstein karl marx emphasized considered marx both far historically important freud finer thinker
political ideas activities fromm's best known work escape freedom focuses human urge seek source authority control upon reaching freedom thought individual’s true desire
fromm’s critique modern political order capitalist system led seek insights medieval feudalism
escape freedom found favor lack individual freedom rigid structure obligations required members medieval society characterizes medieval contrast modern society lack individual freedom…but altogether person free modern sense neither alone isolated
having distinct unchangeable unquestionable place social world moment birth man rooted structuralized whole thus life meaning left no place no need doubt…there comparatively little competition
born certain economic position guaranteed livelihood determined tradition just carried economic obligations those higher social hierarchy

culmination fromm's social political philosophy book sane society published 1955 argued favor humanistic democratic socialism

involvement vietnam war
after supporting senator eugene mc carthy's losing bid democratic presidential nomination fromm less retreated american political scene although write paper 1974 entitled remarks policy détente hearing held u
senate committee foreign relations
criticism eros civilization herbert marcuse critical fromm beginning radical theorist later turned conformity
marcuse also noted fromm well close colleagues sullivan karen horney removed freud's libido theory other radical concepts thus reduced psychoanalysis set idealist ethics embrace status quo
fromm's response both sane society anatomy human destructiveness argues freud indeed deserves substantial credit recognizing central importance unconscious also tended reify own concepts depicted self passive outcome instinct social control minimal volition variability
fromm argues later scholars such marcuse accepted these concepts dogma whereas social psychology requires dynamic theoretical empirical approach
reference fromm's leftist political activism public intellectual noam chomsky liked fromm's attitudes thought work pretty superficial
