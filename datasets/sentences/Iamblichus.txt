our knowledge system indebted partly fragments writings preserved stobaeus others
notes successors especially proclus well five extant books sections great work pythagorean philosophy also reveal much iamblichus' system
besides these proclus seems ascribed authorship celebrated treatise theurgia egyptian mysteries
however differences book iamblichus' other works style points doctrine led question whether iamblichus actual author
still treatise certainly originated school systematic attempt give speculative justification polytheistic cult practices day marks turning-point history thought iamblichus stood
speculative theory neoplatonism received highest development plotinus
modifications introduced lamblichus detailed elaboration formal divisions systematic application pythagorean number-symbolism under influence oriental systems thoroughly mythical interpretation neoplatonism formerly regarded notional
unlike plotinus broke platonic tradition asserted undescended soul iamblichus re-affirmed soul's embodiment matter believing matter divine rest cosmos

iamblichus highly praised those followed thought
contemporaries iamblichus accredited miraculous powers

during revival interest philosophy 15 th 16 th centuries name iamblichus scarcely mentioned without epithet divine most divine
iamblichus' cosmology head system iamblichus placed transcendent incommunicable monad whose first principle intellect nous
immediately after absolute lamblichus introduced second superexistent stand 'the many' producer intellect soul psyche
initial dyad
first highest nous plotinus represented under three stages objective being subjective life realized intellect distinguished iamblichus spheres intelligible intellective latter sphere being domain thought former objects thought
these three entities psyche nous split intelligible intellective form triad
two worlds once separating uniting them scholars think there inserted lamblichus afterwards proclus third sphere partaking nature both
supposition depends merely conjectural emendation text
read however intellectual triad assigned third rank demiurge
demiurge platonic creator-god thus identified perfected nous intellectual triad being increased hebdomad
identification nous demiurge significant moment neoplatonic tradition adoption development within christian tradition
augustine follows plotinus identifying nous bears logos creative principle
whereas hellenes call principle demiurge augustine identifies activity content principle belonging three aspects divine trinity—the son word logos
iamblichus plotinus commonly assert nous produced nature mediation intellect here intelligible gods followed triad psychic gods
first these psychic gods incommunicable supramundane while other two seem mundane though rational
third class mundane gods there still greater wealth divinities various local position function rank
iamblichus gods angels demons heroes twelve heavenly gods whose number increased thirty-six three hundred sixty seventy-two other gods proceeding them twenty-one chiefs forty-two nature-gods besides guardian divinities particular individuals nations
realm divinities stretched original down material nature itself soul fact descended matter became embodied human beings
basically iamblichus greatly multiplied ranks being divine entities universe number each level relating various mathematical proportions
world thus peopled crowd superhuman beings influencing natural events possessing communicating knowledge future accessible prayers offerings
whole iamblichus's complex theory ruled mathematical formalism triad hebdomad etc
while first principle identified monad dyad triad symbolic meanings being also assigned other numbers
theorems mathematics says apply absolutely things things divine original matter
though subjects things number holds elsewhere numbers independent existences occupy middle place limited unlimited
another difficulty system account given nature
bound indissoluble chains necessity called fate distinguished divine things subject fate
yet being itself result higher powers becoming corporeal continual stream elevating influence flows them interfering necessary laws turning good ends imperfect evil
evil no satisfactory account given generated accidentally conflict finite infinite
