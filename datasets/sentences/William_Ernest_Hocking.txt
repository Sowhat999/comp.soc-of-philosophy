hocking believed nothing ultimately irrational declared there no unknowable
negative pragmatism perhaps hocking's most important contribution philosophy negative pragmatism means works pragmatically might might true does work must false
sahakian sahakian state
idea does work then cannot possibly true reason truth works
criterion truth definition
stipulates truth constant -- truth works
sahakian analysis indicates may think true might illusion -- appears working may may true
example say sun rising setting though seemingly true visually false because appearance due motion earth sun moving up down relation earth
illusion caused ancients falsely believe geocentric universe rather currently accepted heliocentric view
hocking's criterion corroborated mid-20 th century richard feynman physicist won nobel prize
feynman states anything described true
never proved right because tomorrow's experiment might succeed proving wrong you thought right
disagrees experiment wrong
finally sahakian sahakian note inadequacies limited application other criteria truth present denigrate negative pragmatism
find inadequacy any criterion invoke negative pragmatism
denote failure any criterion show how disagrees experiment feynman and/or does work hocking
means use negative pragmatism de facto criterion other criteria judged
