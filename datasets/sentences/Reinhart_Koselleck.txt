critique crisis dissertation 1959 book koselleck argues contemporary understandings politics become dangerously depoliticized enlightenment utopianism reaction against absolutism hobbesian state itself reaction against religious wars reformation period europe
koselleck closely follows carl schmitt's argument leviathan state theory thomas hobbes arguing absolutist state made morality matter strictly private individual judgement disallowing moral conscience any role political decision making
overcame religious civil war gave rise early modern centralized state clear narrow authoritarian conception politics monopolization legitimate violence guaranteeing obedience security order
consequently within absolutist state private realm grew power enabled degree civil liberalism afforded regime toward private life
private moral sphere nurtured enlightenment especially claims koselleck republic letters non-political bourgeois secret societies such illuminati freemasons consolidating itself around self-conception emergent bourgeois society during 18 th century
society constituted counter-veiling power upholding legitimacy critique against existing political authoritarianism eventually challenged state apolitical utopian way
process writes victor gourevitch foreword critique crisis existing political societies came judged standards take little no account constraints political men must inevitably take account standards political intents purposes therefore utopian
problem moralism utopianism modern ideologies purely speculative offer no viable alternatives prevailing institutions practices

koselleck argues politics better understood point view public servants politicians statesman embedded within political institutions immanently aware their constraints limitations rather supposedly disinterested perspective philosophers other social critics
aim re-politicize contemporary discussions politics infuse them sense conflict inevitable part public life unavoidable factor political decision making argument reminiscent carl schmitt koselleck's most important mentor
koselleck's portrayal enlightenment public sphere critique crisis often criticized reactionary anti-modernist
emphasis secrecy hypocrisy 18 th century german enlightenment preoccupation enlightenment source conflict crisis read overly pessimistic account origins modern world-views
sits stark contrast work jürgen habermas whose account 18 th century enlightenment holds up model democratic deliberative politics
moreover claim introduction critique crisis 20 th century gripped catastrophic world crisis criticized being guilty same sort secular eschatology warns against within text itself
others insist accusations against koselleck reactionary pessimism overstated rather attempting engender reflexive realistic use political social concepts
