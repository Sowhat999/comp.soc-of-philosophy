work condillac important both psychologist having established systematically france principles john locke
voltaire made english philosopher fashionable
condillac developed concept empirical sensationism demonstrated lucidity brevity moderation earnest striving after logical method
[citation needed] first book essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines keeps close english master
accepts reluctance locke's deduction our knowledge two sources sensation reflection
uses main principle explanation association ideas
next book traité des systèmes vigorous criticism those modern systems based upon abstract principles upon unsound hypotheses
polemic inspired throughout locke directed against innate ideas cartesians malebranche's faculty-psychology leibniz's monadism pre-established harmony above against conception substance set forth first part ethics baruch spinoza
far most important works traité des sensations condillac treats psychology own characteristic way
questioned locke's doctrine senses give us intuitive knowledge objects eye example naturally judges shapes sizes positions distances
believed necessary study senses separately distinguish precisely ideas owed each sense observe how senses trained how sense aids another
believed conclusion human faculty knowledge transformed sensation exclusion any other principle such reflection
author imagines statue organized inwardly like man animated soul never received idea no sense-impression ever penetrated
unlocks senses beginning smell sense contributes least human knowledge
first experience smell consciousness statue entirely occupied occupancy consciousness attention
statue's smell-experience will produce pleasure pain pleasure pain will thenceforward master-principle determining operations mind will raise degrees knowledge capable
next stage memory lingering impression smell experience upon attention memory nothing mode feeling
memory springs comparison statue experiences smell say rose while remembering carnation comparison nothing giving one's attention two things simultaneously
soon statue comparison judgment
comparisons judgments become habitual stored mind formed series thus arises powerful principle association ideas
comparison past present experiences respect their pleasure-giving quality arises desire desire determines operation our faculties stimulates memory imagination gives rise passions
passions also nothing sensation transformed
these indications will suffice show general course argument first section traité des sensations
thoroughly developed idea through subsequent chapters ideas man limited sense smell man limited sense hearing smell hearing combined taste itself taste combined smell hearing man limited sense sight
second section treatise condillac invests statue sense touch first informs existence external objects
very careful elaborate analysis distinguishes various elements our tactile experiences-the touching one's own body touching objects other one's own body experience movement exploration surfaces hands traces growth statue's perceptions extension distance shape
third section deals combination touch other senses
fourth section deals desires activities ideas isolated man enjoys possession senses ends observations wild boy found living among bears forests lithuania
conclusion whole work natural order things everything source sensation yet source equally abundant men men differ greatly degree vividness feel
finally says man nothing acquired innate faculties ideas swept away
modern theories evolution heredity differed
condillac's work politics history cours d'études considered less interest
logic extensively far less successful psychology
enlarges much iteration supremacy analytic method argues reasoning consists substitution proposition another identical lays down science same thing well-constructed language proposition langue des calculs tries prove example arithmetic
logic limited study sensations lack knowledge science other mathematics
rejects medieval apparatus syllogism precluded standpoint understanding active spiritual character thought nor interest natural science appreciation inductive reasoning form chief merit js mill
obvious enough condillac's anti-spiritual psychology explanation personality aggregate sensations leads straight atheism determinism
there however no reason question sincerity repudiates both these consequences
says upon religion harmony profession vindicated freedom will dissertation very little common traité des sensations appended
common reproach materialism should certainly made against
asserts substantive reality soul opening words essai whether rise heaven descend abyss never get outside ourselves--it our own thoughts perceive subjectivist principle forms starting-point berkeley
[citation needed] language condillac considered language vehicle senses emotions transformed higher mental faculties
believed structure language reflects structure thought compared ideas sounds harpsichord
theories major effect development linguistics
condillac promoted sensationalism theory says knowledge comes senses there no innate ideas
condillac promoted expressionist theory linguistic creation anticipates prime features later thoughts language german theorist johann gottfried herder 1744–1803
economics condillac's 'le commerce et le gouvernement' published 1776 same year adam smith's wealth nations attempted place economics coherent logical framework
friend physiocrat françois quesnay leader physiocrats
much condillac's work reflected mainstream physiocrats particularly analysis structure taxation proposals revival economy also proposed another line argument claiming producers work obtain utility
most physiocrats rejected utility idea ignored until 'rediscovery' stanley jevons carl menger 1871
theory vrai prix [true price] condillac proposed theory human history divided two phases progress decline
progress marked rational development use resources decline precipitated bad behavior upper classes then trickles down workers encouraging excess luxury false prices harm masses
condillac saw remedy vrai prix true price created unimpeded interaction supply demand achieved complete deregulation
people taught work toward their best interest open market through reshaping their perceptions
advocating free market economy contrast prevailing contemporary policy state control france condillac influenced classical liberal economics history condillac's histoire ancienne histoire moderne 1758–1767 demonstrated how experience observation past aided man
history mere retelling past source information inspiration well
reason critical thinking improve man's lot destroy superstition fanaticism
history thus served moral political philosophical textbook taught man live better
thus two histories present basic program enlightenment crystallized form
legacy fitting disciple locke condillac's ideas most importance their effect upon english thought
matters connected association ideas supremacy pleasure pain general explanation mental contents sensations transformed sensations influence traced upon mills upon bain herbert spencer
apart any definite propositions condillac notable work direction making psychology science great step desultory genial observation locke rigorous analysis condillac short-sighted defective analysis may seem us light fuller knowledge
method however imaginative reconstruction no means suited english ways thinking
spite protests against abstraction hypothesis synthesis allegory statue highest degree abstract hypothetical synthetic
james mill stood study concrete realities put condillac hands youthful son warning here example avoid method psychology
modern historian compared condillac scottish enlightenment philosopher pre-evolutionary thinker lord monboddo similar fascination abstraction ideas
