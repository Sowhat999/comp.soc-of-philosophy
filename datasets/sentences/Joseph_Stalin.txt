calculating number victims photo 1943 exhumation mass grave polish officers killed nkvd katyń forest 1940
before dissolution soviet union researchers attempted count number people killed under stalin's regime produced estimates ranging 3 60 million
after soviet union dissolved evidence soviet archives also became available containing official records 799455 executions 1921–1953 around
7 million deaths gulag 390000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement total 2
9 million officially recorded victims these categories
official soviet archival records contain comprehensive figures categories victims such those ethnic deportations german population transfers aftermath world war ii
weitz 1948 according nicolas werth mortality rate 600000 people deported caucasus 1943 1944 reached 25%
other notable exclusions nkvd data repression deaths include katyn massacre other killings newly occupied areas mass shootings red army personnel deserters so-called deserters 1941
soviets executed 158000 soldiers desertion during war blocking detachments nkvd shot thousands
also official statistics gulag mortality exclude deaths prisoners taking place shortly after their release resulted harsh treatment camps
historians also believe official archival figures categories recorded soviet authorities unreliable incomplete
addition failures regarding comprehensive recordings additional example robert gellately simon sebag montefiore argue many suspects beaten tortured death while investigative custody likely counted amongst executed
historians working after soviet union's dissolution estimated victim totals ranging approximately 4 million nearly 10 million including those died famines
russian writer vadim erlikman example makes following estimates executions
5 million gulags 5 million deportations
7 million out 7
5 million deported pows german civilians million total 9 million victims repression
also included deaths 6 million people 1932–1933 famine among victims stalin's repression
categorization controversial however historians differ whether famine deliberate part campaign repression against kulaks others simply unintended consequence struggle over forced collectivization
accordingly famine victims included minimum around 10 million deaths—6 million famine 4 million other causes—are attributable regime number recent historians suggesting likely total around 20 million citing much higher victim totals executions gulag camps deportations other causes
adding 6–8 million famine victims erlikman's estimates above example yield total 15 17 million victims
researcher robert conquest meanwhile revised original estimate up 30 million victims down 20 million
most recent edition great terror 2007 conquest states while exact numbers may never known complete certainty least 15 million people either executed worked death camps
rj rummel maintains earlier higher victim total estimates correct although includes those killed soviet government other eastern european countries well
