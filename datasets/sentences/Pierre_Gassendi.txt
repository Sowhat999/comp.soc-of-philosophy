henri louis habert de montmor published gassendi's collected works most importantly syntagma philosophicum opera
1658 6 vols
nicolaus averanius published another edition also 6 folio volumes 1727
first two comprise entirely syntagma philosophicum third contains critical writings epicurus aristotle descartes robert fludd herbert cherbury occasional pieces certain problems physics fourth institutio astronomica commentarii de rebus celestibus fifth commentary tenth book diogenes laërtius biographies epicurus nicolas-claude fabri de peiresc tycho brahe nicolaus copernicus georg von peuerbach regiomontanus tracts value ancient money roman calendar theory music appended large prolix piece entitled notitia ecclesiae diniensis sixth volume contains correspondence
lives especially those copernicus tycho peiresc received much praise
philosophical writing exercitationes excited much attention though contain little nothing beyond others already advanced against aristotle
first book expounds clearly much vigour evil effects blind acceptance aristotelian dicta physical philosophical study occurs many anti-aristotelian works period objections show usual ignorance aristotle's own writings[citation needed]
second book contains review aristotle's dialectic logic throughout reflects ramism tone method
objections descartes became famous through descartes's statement appendix objections meditations
animadversiones epicurus book animadversiones published 1649 contains translation diogenes laertius book x epicurus appeared commentary form syntagma philosophiae epicuri
labors epicurus historical importance criticized holding doctrines arguably irreconcilable strong expressions empiricism
book maintains maxim there nothing intellect senses nihil est intellectu quod non prius fuerit sensu contends imaginative faculty phantasia counterpart sense because involves material images therefore intrinsically material essentially same both men brutes
however also admits classic qualifier humanity intellect affirms immaterial immortal comes understanding notions truths no effort sensation imagination attained op
illustrates capacity form general notions conception universality ib
384 says brutes never able partake though utilize phantasia truly men notion god whom says may imagine corporeal understand incorporeal lastly reflex mind makes phenomena operations within objects attention
english epicurean walter charleton produced english free adaptation book physiologia epicuro-gassendo-charletonia 1654
syntagma philosophicum syntagma philosophicum sub-divides according usual fashion epicureans logic gassendi epicurus truly canonic physics ethics
logic contains sketch history science de origine et varietate logicae divided theory right apprehension bene imaginari theory right judgment bene proponere theory right inference bene colligere theory right method bene ordinare
first part contains specially empirical positions gassendi afterwards neglects leaves out account
senses sole source knowledge supposedly yield us immediate cognition individual things phantasy gassendi takes material nature reproduces these ideas understanding compares these ideas each particular frames general ideas
nevertheless admits senses yield knowledge—not things—but qualities arrive idea thing substance inductive reasoning
holds true method research analytic rising lower higher notions yet sees admits inductive reasoning conceived francis bacon rests general proposition itself proved induction
whole doctrine judgment syllogism method mixes aristotelian ramist notions
second part syntagma physics appears most glaring contradiction gassendi's fundamental principles
while approving epicurean physics rejects epicurean negation god particular providence
states various proofs existence immaterial infinite supreme being asserts being author visible universe strongly defends doctrine foreknowledge particular providence god
same time holds opposition epicureanism doctrine immaterial rational soul endowed immortality capable free determination
friedrich albert lange claimed portion gassendi's system contains nothing own opinions introduced solely motives self-defence
positive exposition atomism much attractive hypothesis calor vitalis vital heat species anima mundi world-soul introduces physical explanation physical phenomena does seem throw much light special problems invokes solve
nor theory weight essential atoms being due inner force impelling them motion any way reconcilable general doctrine mechanical causes
third part ethics over above discussion freedom whole indefinite there little beyond milder statement epicurean moral code
final end life happiness happiness harmony soul body tranquillitas animi et indolentia corporis
probably gassendi thinks perfect happiness attainable life may life come
views according gabriel daniel gassendi little pyrrhonian matters science no bad thing
against magical animism robert fludd judicial astrology
became dissatisfied peripatetic system orthodox approach natural philosophy based writings aristotle
gassendi shared empirical tendencies age
contributed objections against aristotelian philosophy waited publish own thoughts
there remains controversy extent gassendi subscribed so-called libertinage érudit learned free-thinking characterised tétrade parisian circle belonged along gabriel naudé two others élie diodati françois de mothe le vayer
gassendi least belonged fideist wing sceptics arguing absence certain knowledge implied room faith
dispute descartes apparently hold evidence senses remains convincing evidence yet maintains natural mathematical training evidence reason absolutely satisfactory
