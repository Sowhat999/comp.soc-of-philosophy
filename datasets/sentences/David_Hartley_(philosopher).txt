two main theories doctrine vibrations doctrine associations
physical theory tells us drawn certain speculations nervous action isaac newton published principia
psychological theory suggested dissertation concerning fundamental principles virtue morality written clergyman named john gay 1699—1745 prefixed bishop law translation archbishop king's latin work origin evil chief object being show sympathy conscience developments means association selfish feelings
work also contained thoughts christian apologetics theology published under title truth christian religion

hartley's theories outlines hartley's theory follows
like john locke asserted prior sensation human mind blank slate
growth simple sensations those states consciousness appear most remote sensation come being
law growth hartley took account law contiguity synchronous successive
law sought explain phenomena memory others similarly explained before also phenomena emotion reasoning voluntary involuntary action see association ideas
friend associate chief advocates joseph priestley 1733–1804 discoverer oxygen
priestley foremost scientists age
doctrine vibrations hartley's physical theory gave birth modern study intimate connection physiological psychical facts
believed sensation result vibration minute particles medullary substance nerves account postulated newton subtle elastic ether rare interstices solid bodies their close neighbourhood denser recedes them
pleasure result moderate vibrations pain vibrations violent break continuity nerves
these vibrations leave behind them brain tendency fainter vibrations vibratiuncles similar kind correspond ideas sensation
accounts memory
doctrine associations course reminiscence thoughts generally immediately dependent upon external sensation accounted idea there vibrations brain account heat pulsation arteries
nature these vibrations determined each man's past experience circumstances moment causes another tendency prevail over rest
sensations often associated together become each associated ideas corresponding others ideas corresponding associated sensations become associated together sometimes intimately form appears new simple idea without careful analysis resolvable component parts
free will starting detailed account phenomena senses hartley tried show how above laws emotions analyses considerable skill may explained
locke's phrase association ideas employed throughout idea being taken including every mental state sensation
emphatically asserts existence pure disinterested sentiment while declaring growth self-regarding feelings
voluntary action explained result firm connexion motion sensation idea physical side ideal motory vibration
therefore freewill controversy hartley took place determinist
reluctance speculations nearly complete came conclusion subject accordance theory
