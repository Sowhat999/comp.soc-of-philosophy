my esteem biblical witness my approach bible should enough disclose my skepticism current efforts construct political theology according ideological model
refer specific example attempts articulate pseudo-biblical rationale classical marxism lately become prominent oddly enough simultaneously both post-industrial societies north america europe still pre-industrialized regions asia latin america africa
[b]iblical politics never implies particular elaborated political theology whether echoing status quo aspires overthrow displace status quo
gospel ideology categorically gospel cannot ideologized
biblical politics posture tension opposition prevalent system any prospective incipient status quo ideologies either regime revolution
biblical politics alienated politics age
11â€“13 sense while stringfellow may well side side those resisting whatever type level oppression further resist resistance being turned any sort closed ideological system separable gospel message itself
