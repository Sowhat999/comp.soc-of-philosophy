frederick established prussia fifth smallest european great power using resources frugal father cultivated
battle hohenfriedberg attack prussian infantry carl röchling
upon succeeding throne 31 may 1740 upon death father desiring prosperous austrian province silesia frederick declined endorse pragmatic sanction 1713 legal mechanism ensure inheritance habsburg domains maria theresa austria
thus upon death emperor charles vi holy roman empire 29 october 1740 frederick disputed succession charles vi's 23-year-old daughter maria theresa new empress holy roman empire particular province silesia
accordingly war austrian succession began 16 december 1740 frederick invaded quickly occupied silesia
frederick worried move occupy silesia augustus iii king poland elector saxony seek connect own disparate lands through silesia
therefore prussian king struck pre-emptively quickly occupied silesia using justification obscure treaty 1537 hohenzollern piast dynasty brieg brzeg
frederick occupied silesia except three fortresses glogau brieg breslau just seven weeks despite poor roads bad weather
fortress ohlau fell frederick almost immediately became winter quarters frederick's army
late march 1741 frederick set out campaign again forced fall back sudden surprise attack austrians
first real battle frederick faced silesia battle mollwitz 10 april 1741
though frederick actually served under prince eugene savoy first time command army
believing army defeated austrians frederick sought avoid capture galloped away leaving field marshal kurt schwerin command army

peace terms treaty breslau austrians prussians negotiated june 1742 gave prussia silesia glatz county austrians retaining portion upper silesia called austrian czech silesia
prussian possession silesia gave kingdom control over navigable oder river
1744 frederick also gained territory east frisia located north sea coast germany after its' last ruler died without issue

accordingly quickly made another alliance french preemptively invaded bohemia august 1744
late august 1744 frederick's columns crossed bohemian frontier
frederick marched straight prague laid siege city
thus second silesian war 1744–1745 began

frederick narrowly avoids capture cossacks kunersdorf 1759 sudden death empress elizabeth russia january 1762 led succession her germanized nephew duke holstein-gottorp pro-prussian peter iii
miracle house brandenburg led collapse anti-prussian coalition
peter iii's first diplomatic endeavors seek prussian title frederick frederick naturally obliged
peter iii enamored frederick offered full use russian corps remainder war also frederick rather general prussian army tsar russia
significantly russia's about-face once enemy prussia patron rattled leadership sweden seeing writing wall hastily made peace frederick well
threat eastern borders over france occupied struggle britain frederick able win back territories austrians including silesia finally brought them peace table
although frederick gain lose any territory ensuing treaty hubertusburg ability retain silesia during silesian wars made prussia popular throughout german-speaking territories
year following treaty hubertusberg catherine great peter iii's widow concluded eight-year alliance prussia
frederick's ultimate success seven years' war came heavy price
although prussia remained financially stable war's conclusion unlike most other major belligerents its' population devastated various invasions austria russia sweden
many frederick's closest friends including sister wilhelmine best officer corps died during war
war bavarian succession late life frederick also involved prussia low-scale war bavarian succession 1778 stifled austrian attempts exchange austrian netherlands bavaria
their part austrians tried pressure french participate war bavarian succession since there guarantees under consideration related peace westphalia clauses linked bourbon dynasty france holy roman empire
unfortunately emperor joseph ii french unable provide sufficient manpower resources endeavor since already struggling north american continent against british aiding american cause independence process
frederick ended up ultimate beneficiary french british struggle across atlantic
emperor joseph ii tried scheme again 1784 frederick created fürstenbund allowing himself seen defender german liberties contrast earlier role attacking imperial habsburgs
process checking joseph ii's attempts acquire bavaria frederick enlisted two very important players electors hanover saxony along several other second rate german princes
perhaps even significant frederick benefited defection senior prelate german church archbishop mainz also arch-chancellor holy roman empire further strengthened frederick's standing amid german states
frederick before battle torgau 1760 military theorist contrary father feared frederick proved himself very courageous battle exception first battlefield experience mollwitz
frequently led military forces personally six horses shot under during battle
often admired greatest tactical geniuses time especially usage oblique order battle attack focused flank opposing line allowing local advantage perhaps overall weaker force
even important operational successes especially preventing unification numerically superior opposing armies being right place right time keep enemy armies out prussian core territory
example place frederick holds history ruler seen napoleon bonaparte saw prussian king greatest tactical genius time after napoleon's victory fourth coalition 1807 visited frederick's tomb potsdam remarked officers gentlemen man still alive here
napoleon frequently pored through frederick's campaign narratives statuette placed personal cabinet
frederick napoleon perhaps most admiringly quoted military leaders clausewitz' war
frederick's use oblique order clausewitz praised particularly quick skillful movement troops
frederick great's most notable decisive military victories battlefield battles hohenfriedberg fought during war austrian succession june 1745 battle rossbach frederick defeated combined franco-austrian army 41000 mere 21000 soldiers 10000 dead franco-austrian side 550 casualties prussia battle leuthen follow up victory rossbach pitting frederick's 36000 troops against charles lorraine's austrian force 80000—frederick's masterful strategy tactics leuthen inflicted 7000 casualties upon austrians yielded 20000 prisoners
frederick great believed creating alliances necessary prussia comparable resources nations like france austria
after seven years' war prussian military acquired formidable reputation across europe
esteemed their efficiency success battle prussian army frederick became model emulated other european powers most notably russia france latter quickly applied lessons frederick's military tactics under direction napoleon bonaparte upon their erstwhile european neighbors
joseph ii austria frederick influential military theorist whose analysis emerged extensive personal battlefield experience covered issues strategy tactics mobility logistics
austrian co-ruler emperor joseph ii king prussia speaks problems connected art war studied intensively read every conceivable book then everything taut solid uncommonly instructive
there no circumlocutions gives factual historical proof assertions makes well versed history
historian robert m
citino describes frederick's strategic approach war
usually saw path victory fixing enemy army place maneuvering near even around give himself favorable position attack then smashing overwhelming blow unexpected direction
most aggressive field commander century perhaps time constantly pushed limits possible
historian dennis showalter argues king also consistently willing any contemporaries seek decision through offensive operations
foresight ranked among most important attributes fighting enemy according prussian monarch discriminating commander must see everything before takes place nothing will new
thus flexibility often paramount military success
donning both skin fox lion battle frederick once remarked reveals intellectual dexterity applied art warfare
much structure modern german general staff owed existence extensive structure frederick along accompanying power autonomy given commanders field
according citino later generations prussian-german staff officers looked back age frederick saw commander repeatedly even joyfully risked everything single day's battle - army kingdom often very life
far frederick concerned there two major battlefield considerations - speed march speed fire
confident performance men selected command compared those enemy frederick once quipped general considered audacious another country ordinary [prussia] [our general] able dare undertake anything possible men execute
even later military reputation prussia under bismarck moltke rested weight mid-eighteenth century military developments territorial expansion frederick great
despite dazzling success military commander frederick no fan protracted warfare once our wars should short quickly fought… long war destroys … our [army’s] discipline depopulates country exhausts our resources
martial adeptness thoroughness discipline often witnessed battlefield correspondingly reflected domestic front frederick
lieu military predilections frederick administered kingdom justly ranks among most enlightened monarchs era notwithstanding fact many ways frederick great represented embodiment art war
consequently frederick continues held high regard military theorist world over
first partition poland main article first partition poland polish-lithuanian commonwealth after first partition 1772 frederick despised polish people since youth numerous statements known expressed anti-polish prejudice calling polish society stupid stating these people surnames ending -ski deserve contempt passionately hated everything associated poland while justifying hatred ideas enlightenment
described poles slovenly polish trash
frederick undertook conquest polish territory enlightened civilizing mission particularly given negative perceptions poland traditions ruling elite merely provided convenient path sanguine ameliorism enlightenment heightened assurance distinctive merits 'prussian way'
prepared ground partition poland-lithuania 1752 latest hoping gain territorial bridge pomerania brandenburg east prussian provinces
frederick himself partly responsible weakness polish government having inflated currency polish coin dies obtained during conquest saxony 1756
profits exceeded twice peacetime national budget prussia
opposed attempts political reform poland troops bombarded customs ports vistula thwarting polish efforts create modern fiscal system
early 1731 frederick suggested country well-served annexing polish prussia order join separated territories kingdom prussia
lewitter says conflict over rights religious dissenters [in poland] led civil war foreign intervention
out 12 million people poland 200000 protestants 600000 eastern orthodox
protestant dissidents still free practice their religion although their schools shut down
dissidents own property poland increasingly reduced their civic rights after period considerable religious political freedoms
allowed serve army vote elections barred public offices polish parliament sejm during 1760 s their importance became out proportion compared their numbers
frederick exploited conflict means keep poland weak divided
according scott frederick eager exploit poland economically part wider aim increasing prussia's wealth
scott views continuation previous violations polish territory 1759 1761 raids within greater poland until 1765
after acquiring dies currency poland struck prussia issued debased polish coins drove money out poland hohenzollern territory estimated[by whom?] gained frederick 25 million thalers profit while causing considerable monetary problems poland
empress catherine ii russia staunchly opposed prussia
same time frederick opposed russia whose troops allowed freely cross polish-lithuanian commonwealth during seven years' war 1756-1763
despite their personal hostility frederick catherine signed defensive alliance 1764 guaranteed prussian control silesia return prussian support russia against austria ottoman empire
catherine's candidate polish throne stanisław august poniatowski then elected king poland september year she controlled polish politics
king frederick ii anna dorothea therbusch 1772
frederick became concerned however after russia gained significant influence over poland repnin sejm 1767 position also threatened austria ottoman turks
ensuing russo-turkish war 1768–1774 frederick supported catherine subsidy 300000 rubles reluctance want russia become even stronger through acquisitions ottoman territory
prussian king achieved rapprochement emperor joseph austrian chancellor kaunitz
after russia occupied danubian principalities 1769/1770 frederick's representative saint petersburg brother prince henry convinced frederick maria theresa balance power maintained tripartite division polish-lithuanian commonwealth instead russia taking land ottomans
agreed first partition poland 1772 took place without war
frederick claimed most polish province royal prussia
prussia annexed 20000 square miles 52000 km2 600000 inhabitants least partitioning powers
however prussia's polish territory also best-developed economically
newly created province west prussia connected east prussia farther pomerania granted prussia control mouth vistula river
although maria theresa reluctantly agreed partition frederick commented she cries she takes
frederick invited german immigrants province also hoping displace poles
frederick himself tried further propaganda justifying partition portraying acquired provinces underdeveloped improved prussian rule
according karin friedrich these claims accepted long time german historiography sometimes still reflected modern works
[verification needed]
frederick however justify conquests ethnic basis unlike later nationalist 19 th-century german historians
dismissive contemporary german culture frederick instead pursuing imperialist policy acting security interests state
frederick ii settled 300000 colonists territories conquered enforced germanization
after first partition frederick engaged plunder polish property confiscating polish estates monasteries support german colonization 1786 ordered forced buy-outs polish holdings
new strict tax system bureaucracy particularly disliked among polish population compulsory military service army didn't exist previously poland
frederick abolished gentry's freedom taxation restricted power
royal estates formerly belonging polish crown redistributed german landowners reinforcing germanization
both protestant roman catholic teachers mostly jesuits taught west prussia teachers administrators encouraged able speak both german polish
[verification needed] economic exploitation poland especially prussia austria followed territorial seizures
frederick looked upon many new polish citizens scorn carefully concealed scorn actually dealing them
frederick's long-term goal remove polish people territories both peasants nobility expelling nobles through oppressive tax system through other measures[citation needed] eradicating polish national character rural population mixing them germans invited their thousands promises free land such means frederick boasted gradually
get rid poles

conquest silesia gave prussia's fledgling industries access raw materials fertile agricultural lands
protected industries high tariffs minimal restrictions domestic trade
help french experts organized system indirect taxation provided state revenue direct taxation
frederick great commissioned johann ernst gotzkowsky promote trade and—to take competition france—put silk factory soon 1500 people found employment
frederick great followed recommendations field toll levies import restrictions
1763 gotzkowsky went broke during financial crisis started amsterdam frederick took over porcelain factory known kpm refused buy paintings
frederick great during seven years' war painting richard knötel
frederick's greatest achievements included control grain prices whereby government storehouses enable civilian population survive needy regions harvest poor
during reign frederick effects seven years' war gaining silesia greatly changed economy
circulation depreciated money kept prices high
revalue thaler mint edict may 1763 proposed
stabilized rates depreciated coins accepted provided payments taxes currency prewar value
replaced northern germany reichsthaler worth one-fourth conventionsthaler
prussia used thaler containing one-fourteenth cologne mark silver
many other rulers soon followed steps frederick reforming their own currencies—this resulted shortage ready money thus lowering prices
1781 frederick decided make coffee royal monopoly disabled soldiers employed spy citizens sniffing search illegally roasted coffee much annoyance general population frederick gave state modern bureaucracy whose mainstay until 1760 able war finance minister adam ludwig von blumenthal succeeded 1764 nephew joachim ran ministry end reign beyond
prussia's education system seen best europe

made possible men noble stock become judges senior bureaucrats
langer finds prussian justice became most prompt efficient europe
frederick began titling himself king prussia after acquisition royal prussia west prussia 1772 phrasing king prussia used prior beginning coronation frederick königsberg 1701
religious policies while frederick tolerated faiths realm protestantism became favored religion catholics chosen higher state positions
fredrick known tolerant jews catholics many neighboring german states although considered most jews serfs less human
frederick retained jesuits teachers silesia warmia netze district after their suppression pope clement
just like catherine ii frederick recognized educational skills jesuits asset nation
interested attracting diversity skills country whether jesuit teachers huguenot citizens jewish merchants bankers best known rothschilds frankfurt eventually attained status court bankers hesse-kassel 1795 after frederick's passing
nonetheless frederick wanted development throughout country specifically areas judged needing particular kind development
thus accepted countless protestant weavers bohemia fleeing devoutly catholic rule maria theresa
frederick granted weavers freedom taxes military service
example frederick's practical-minded fully unprejudiced tolerance frederick testament politique too many jews towns
needed polish border because these areas hebrews alone perform trade
soon you get away frontier jews become disadvantage form cliques deal contraband get up manner rascally tricks detrimental christian burghers merchants
never persecuted anyone any other sect think however prudent pay attention their numbers increase
jews polish border therefore encouraged perform trade received protection support king any other prussian citizen
success integrating jews those areas society frederick encouraged them seen role played gerson von bleichröder financing bismarck's efforts reunite germany
territories conquered poland frederick persecuted polish roman catholic churches confiscating goods property exercising strict control churches interfering church administration south garden facade corps de logis sanssouci frederick made wasteland arable prussia looked new colonists settle land

while using german working language army administration frederick read literary works french also generally used language closest relatives friends
though good command language writing style flawed troubles orthography rely french proofreaders
frederick disliked german language literature explaining german authors pile parenthesis upon parenthesis often you find end entire page verb depends meaning whole sentence
discarded many baroque era authors uncreative pedants especially despised german theatre
also frederick ii mostly indifferent revival german culture later part reign unimpressed authors sturm und drang movement remained essentially classical taste
main inspiration ancient philosophers poets well french authors 17 th century
should however noted interest foreign cultures no means exception germany time
habsburg court vienna open influences italy spain france
many german rulers sought emulate success louis france adopted french tastes manners though often adapted german cultural context
case frederick ii might also reaction austerity familial environnement grew up father deep aversion france interested cultural development state
other hand while still considering german culture time inferior france italy actually take interest development
thought partly hindered great wars 17 th century thirty years' war ottoman wars invasions louis time effort equal even surpass rivals
view require complete codification german language help official academies emergence talented classical german authors extensive patronage arts germanic rulers
however expect see happen lifetime
love french culture without limits either
frederick ii appreciative luxury extravagance french royal court ridiculed german princes indulge those pleasures
own court remained quite simple small restricted limited circle friends
also frederick great dismissive radical philosophy later french thinkers such rousseau grew believe french cultural golden age drawing close
spite lack taste german frederick sponsor königliche deutsche gesellschaft whose aim promote develop german language
allowed association qualified royal gave right seat castle königsberg
however does seem taken much interest work society
frederick also promoted use german instead latin field law though mainly practical reasons
moreover under reign berlin became important center german enlightenment
king's criticism led many german writers attempt impress frederick their writings german language thus prove worthiness
many statesmen including baron vom und zum stein also inspired frederick's statesmanship
johann wolfgang von goethe gave opinion frederick during visit strasbourg strassburg writing well much say favour constitution reich admitted consisted entirely lawful misuses rose therefore higher over present french constitution operating maze unlawful misuses whose government displays energies wrong places therefore face challenge thorough change state affairs widely prophesied
