throughout books political theological themes anarchism pacifism catholicism reappear central influences self-proclaimed 'marginal' approach question technology
work compared marshall mc luhan jean baudrillard gilles deleuze félix guattari jean-françois lyotard jacques ellul others
virilio also urbanist
after having longtime resident city paris now lives rochelle
virilio's predictions 'logistics perception' - use images information war - war cinema 1984 accurate during gulf war invited discuss ideas french military officers
while baudrillard infamously argued gulf war take place virilio argued 'world war miniature'
integral accident virilio believes technology cannot exist without potential accidents
example virilio argues invention locomotive also contained invention derailment
sees accident rather negative growth social positivism scientific progress
believes growth technology namely television separates us directly events real space real time
suggests lose wisdom sight our immediate horizon resort indirect horizon our dissimulated environment
angle accident mentally pictured sort fractal meteorite whose impact prepared propitious darkness landscape events concealing future collisions
aristotle claimed there no science accident virilio disagrees pointing growing credibility simulators designed escape accident— argues industry born unholy marriage post-ww2 science military-industrial complex
hurricane katrina disastrous events followed virilio sees good example integral accident concept brought eyes world upon single nexus time place
article katrina ah oui ce méchant vent vent qui siffle siffle
tout le monde regarde c'est sur toutes les chaînes c'est l'émission dont le monde parle

roughly translated oh yeah evil wind wind blows blows
whole world watching it's every station it's program world talking
it's soggy down there
dromology ‘dromos’ greek noun road virilio takes mean activity race virilio 197747
meaning mind coins term 'dromology' defined science logic speed“
dromology important considering structuring society relation warfare modern media
notes speed something happens may change essential nature moves speed quickly comes dominate slower
'whoever controls territory possesses
possession territory primarily laws contracts first foremost matter movement circulation

virilio talks lot creation cnn concept newshound
newshound will capture images will then sent cnn may then broadcast public

logistics perception relates also televising military maneuvers images conflict watched people home also military personnel involved conflict
'field battle' also exists 'field perception'
war movement virilio transition feudalism capitalism driven primarily politics wealth production techniques mechanics war
virilio argues traditional feudal fortified city disappeared because increasing sophistication weapons possibilities warfare
virilio concept siege warfare became rather war movement
speed politics argues 'history progresses speed weapons systems'
criticism virilio many cultural theorists other 'postmodernists' criticized sokal bricmont 1997 1998 repeated sokal 2008
chapter 10 sokal bricmont 1998 deals exclusively virilio's works
their criticism consists series quotes often long virilio's works then explanations how vilirio allegedly confuses things writes meaningless prose
begin their chapter broad summary writings paul virilio revolve principally around themes technology communication speed
contain plethora references physics particularly theory relativity
though virilio’s sentences slightly meaningful those deleuze-guattari presented “science” mixture monumental confusions wild fantasies
furthermore analogies physics social questions most arbitrary imaginable does simply become intoxicated own words
confess our sympathy many virilio’s political social views cause alas helped pseudo-physics
169 criticism passage often reads something like here virilio mixes up velocity vitesse acceleration two basic concepts kinematics description motion introduced carefully distinguished beginning every introductory physics course
perhaps confusion isn’t worth stressing purported specialist philosophy speed nonetheless bit surprising
170 end their chapter long quote followed comment paragraph — french original single 193-word sentence whose “poetry” unfortunately fully captured translation — most perfect example diarrhea pen ever encountered
far see means precisely nothing
175 quotes 'the first deterrence nuclear deterrence presently being superseded second deterrence type deterrence based call 'the information bomb' associated new weaponry information communications technologies
thus very near future stress important point will no longer war continuation politics other means will dubbed 'the integral accident' continuation politics other means
'the speed light does merely transform world
becomes world
globalisation speed light
'war my university
everything proceeded there
'the invention ship also invention shipwreck
