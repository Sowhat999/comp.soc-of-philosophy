philosophy external video george soros lecture series introduction 256 general theory reflexivity 5200 financial markets 4359 capitalism vs
open society 4738 open society foundations reflexivity financial markets economic theory soros' writings focus heavily concept reflexivity biases individuals enter market transactions potentially changing fundamentals economy
soros argues different principles apply markets depending whether near equilibrium far equilibrium state
argues markets rising falling rapidly typically marked disequilibrium rather equilibrium conventional economic theory market 'efficient market hypothesis' does apply these situations
soros popularized concepts dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium near-equilibrium conditions
stated own financial success attributable edge accorded understanding action reflexive effect
reflexivity based three main ideas reflexivity best observed under special conditions investor bias grows spreads throughout investment arena
examples factors may give rise bias include equity leveraging trend-following habits speculators
reflexivity appears intermittently since most likely revealed under certain conditions
character equilibrium process best considered terms probabilities
investors' observation participation capital markets may times influence valuations fundamental conditions outcomes
recent example reflexivity modern financial markets debt equity housing markets
lenders began make money available people 1990 s buy houses
people bought houses larger amount money thus increasing prices these houses
lenders looked their balance sheets showed made loans their equity backing loans value houses gone up because money chasing same amount housing relatively
thus lent out money because their balance sheets looked good prices rose higher still
further amplified public policy
us home loans guaranteed federal government
many national governments saw home ownership positive outcome introduced grants first-time home buyers other financial subsidies such exemption primary residence capital gains taxation
these further encouraged house purchases leading further price rises further relaxation lending standards
concept reflexivity attempts explain why markets moving equilibrium state another tend overshoot undershoot
soros' theories originally dismissed economists received attention after 2008 crash including becoming focus issue journal economic methodology
notion reflexivity provides explanation theories complexity economics developed santa fe institute although soros publicised views time discipline originally developed there 1980 s
reflexivity politics although primary manifestation reflexive process soros discusses effects financial markets also explored effects politics
stated whereas greatest threats open society past communism fascism discussed open society enemies mentor karl popper largest current threat market fundamentalism
suggested contemporary domination world politics world trade united states reflexive phenomenon insofar success military financial coercion feeds back encourage increasingly intense applications same policies point will eventually become unsustainable
view problems free market system soros argues current system financial speculation undermines healthy economic development many underdeveloped countries
blames many world's problems failures inherent characterizes market fundamentalism
soros claims draw distinction being participant market working change rules market participants must follow
