ayer's views representation two broad types ethical emotivism
analytic philosopher stevenson suggested 1937 essay emotive meaning ethical terms any ethical theory should explain three things intelligent disagreement occur over moral questions moral terms like good magnetic encouraging action scientific method insufficient verifying moral claims
stevenson's own theory fully developed 1944 book ethics language
agrees ayer ethical sentences express speaker's feelings adds also imperative component intended change listener's feelings component greater importance
ayer spoke values fundamental psychological inclinations stevenson speaks attitudes ayer spoke disagreement fact rational disputes over application certain values particular case stevenson speaks differences belief concepts same
terminology aside stevenson interprets ethical statements according two patterns analysis
first pattern analysis under first pattern analysis ethical statement two parts declaration speaker's attitude imperative mirror 'this good' means approve well
first half sentence proposition imperative half stevenson's translation ethical sentence remains noncognitive
imperatives cannot proved still supported listener understands wholly arbitrary close door may ask why? receive such reason too drafty noise distracting
… these reasons cannot called proofs any dangerously extended sense nor demonstratively inductively related imperative manifestly support imperative
back up establish base concrete references fact
purpose these supports make listener understand consequences action being commanded
once understand command's consequences determine whether obedience command will desirable results
imperative used alter hearer's attitudes actions
… supporting reason then describes situation imperative seeks alter new situation imperative seeks bring these facts disclose new situation will satisfy preponderance hearer's desires will hesitate obey no longer
generally reasons support imperatives altering such beliefs may turn alter unwillingness obey
second pattern analysis stevenson's second pattern analysis used statements types actions specific actions
under pattern 'this good' meaning 'this qualities relations x z … except 'good' well laudatory meaning permits express speaker's approval tends evoke approval hearer
second-pattern analysis rather judge action directly speaker evaluating according general principle
instance someone says murder wrong might mean murder decreases happiness overall second-pattern statement leads first-pattern disapprove anything decreases happiness overall
methods argumentation stevenson moral disagreements may arise different fundamental attitudes different moral beliefs specific cases both
methods moral argumentation proposed divided three groups known logical rational psychological nonrational psychological forms argumentation
logical methods involve efforts show inconsistencies person's fundamental attitudes their particular moral beliefs
example someone says edward good person previously edward thief no thieves good people guilty inconsistency until she retracts her statements
similarly person says lying wrong might consider lies situations morally permissible examples these situations given view shown logically inconsistent
rational psychological methods examine facts relate fundamental attitudes particular moral beliefs goal show someone inconsistent logical methods wrong facts connect their attitudes their beliefs
modify former example consider person holds thieves bad people
she sees edward pocket wallet found public place she may conclude thief there no inconsistency her attitude thieves bad people her belief edward bad person because thief
however may edward recognized wallet belonging friend whom promptly returned
such revelation likely change observer's belief edward even attempt reveal such facts count rational psychological form moral argumentation
non-rational psychological methods revolve around language psychological influence no necessarily logical connection listener's attitudes
stevenson called primary such method 'persuasive' somewhat broadened sense [persuasion] depends sheer direct emotional impact words—on emotive meaning rhetorical cadence apt metaphor stentorian stimulating pleading tones voice dramatic gestures care establishing rapport hearer audience
… redirection hearer's attitudes sought mediating step altering beliefs exhortation whether obvious subtle crude refined
persuasion may involve use particular emotion-laden words like democracy dictator hypothetical questions like everyone thought way you do? how you feel you their shoes? bibliography ethics language 1944 facts values 1963 see also american philosophy emotivism list american philosophers references charles leslie stevenson stanford encyclopedia philosophy soames scott 2006 analytic philosophy america pdf misak cheryl oxford handbook american philosophy oxford university press published 2007 retrieved 2007-04-22
