philosophy blanshard rationalist espoused defended strong conception reason during century reason came under philosophical attack
generally regarded last great absolute idealists strongly influenced british idealism especially f
bradley bernard bosanquet nevertheless departed absolute idealism respects
blanshard distinguished epistemological idealism position objects direct experience exist consciousness ontological idealism position world itself mental made mind-stuff
accepted epistemological idealism unlike berkeley hegel royce bosanquet prepared take extra step ontological idealism
allowed material world atomic particles thought composed may exist independently mind
sense accept basic dictum berkeleian ontological idealism esse est percipi perceived
strongly critical positivism logical atomism pragmatism most varieties empiricism held universe consists absolute form single all-encompassing intelligible system each element necessary place
moreover absolute—the universe whole—he held true particular elements within being ultimately resoluble specific universals properties relations combinations thereof might given identically context
regarded metaphysical monism essentially form spinozism
also strongly critical reductionist accounts mind e
behaviorism maintained contrary mind reality fact most certain
thought held activity mind aims truth ultimate object thought full understanding absolute
such understanding comes view through grasp necessity understand explain something see necessitated within system part
blanshard's view absolute thus merely consistent
noncontradictory positively coherent shot through relations necessity indeed operating purely deterministically
blanshard held law causality properly understood logical law believed effects logically determine their causes well vice versa
strictly speaking admitted cannot prove there no atomic facts bare conjunctions sheer surds nature take our working hypothesis relations necessity found until unless hypothesis meets absolute defeat justified adopting least provisionally
early work nature thought defended coherence theory truth
later years however came think relation thought object sui generis might described equally inadequately either correspondence coherence any rate admitted coherence thought ideal object differs coherence may obtain among thoughts
also backed away early less bradleian claim ultimate aim thought identification object
defended strong doctrine internal relations
maintained longtime friend philosophical colleague
ewing doctrine caught far better accurately described terms relevance rather internality
doctrine point no relation entirely irrelevant natures terms relates such relevance therefore internality being matter degree
blanshard's most important exchanges topic philosopher ernest nagel attacked doctrine internal relations — indeed blanshard's entire conception reason — essay sovereign reason
blanshard's fullest published reply appears book reason analysis
sympathetic theism skeptical traditional religious theological dogma regard absolute having characteristics personal god nevertheless maintained proper subject rational religious inquiry even devotion
defining religion dedication one's whole person whatever regards true important took own religion service reason very full all-encompassing metaphysical sense defending called rational temper human ideal though exceedingly difficult achieve practice
admiration temper extended philosophical loyalties across party lines especially philosopher regarded exemplifying temper greatest degree henry sidgwick
also spoke highly bertrand russell
theologically blanshard raised methodist tended toward theological liberalism early age tendency became pronounced grew older
beginning during time swarthmore maintained lifelong connection religious society friends despite personal disagreements quakerism's generally accepted tenets notably pacifism
ethics broadly utilitarian however preferred term teleological since term utilitarian suggested goods instrumental believed e
