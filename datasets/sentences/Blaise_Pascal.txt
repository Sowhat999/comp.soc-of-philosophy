lost mother antoinette begon age three
father étienne pascal 1588–1651 also interest science mathematics local judge member noblesse de robe
pascal two sisters younger jacqueline elder gilberte
1631 five years after death wife étienne pascal moved children paris
newly arrived family soon hired louise delfault maid eventually became instrumental member family
étienne never remarried decided alone educate children showed extraordinary intellectual ability particularly son blaise
young pascal showed amazing aptitude mathematics science
particularly interest pascal work desargues conic sections
following desargues' thinking 16-year-old pascal produced means proof short treatise called mystic hexagram essai pour les coniques essay conics sent it—his first serious work mathematics—to père mersenne paris known still today pascal's theorem
states hexagon inscribed circle conic then three intersection points opposite sides lie line called pascal line
pascal's work precocious descartes convinced pascal's father written
assured mersenne indeed product son father descartes dismissed sniff find strange offered demonstrations conics appropriate those ancients adding other matters related subject proposed scarcely occur 16-year-old child
france time offices positions be—and were—bought sold
1631 étienne sold position second president cour des aides 65665 livres
money invested government bond provided lavish then certainly comfortable income allowed pascal family move enjoy paris
1638 richelieu desperate money carry thirty years' war defaulted government's bonds
suddenly étienne pascal's worth dropped nearly 66000 livres less 7300
early pascaline display musée des arts et métiers paris like many others étienne eventually forced flee paris because opposition fiscal policies cardinal richelieu leaving three children care neighbor madame sainctot great beauty infamous past kept most glittering intellectual salons france
jacqueline performed well children's play richelieu attendance étienne pardoned
time étienne back good graces cardinal 1639 appointed king's commissioner taxes city rouen—a city whose tax records thanks uprisings utter chaos
1642 effort ease father's endless exhausting calculations recalculations taxes owed paid work young pascal recruited pascal yet 19 constructed mechanical calculator capable addition subtraction called pascal's calculator pascaline
eight pascalines known survived four held musée des arts et métiers paris zwinger museum dresden germany exhibit two original mechanical calculators
though these machines pioneering forerunners further 400 years development mechanical methods calculation sense later field computer engineering calculator failed great commercial success
partly because still quite cumbersome use practice probably primarily because extraordinarily expensive pascaline became little toy status symbol very rich both france elsewhere europe
pascal continued make improvements design through next decade refers 50 machines built design
contributions mathematics pascal's triangle
each number sum two directly above
triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties addition showing binomial coefficients
pascal continued influence mathematics throughout life
traité du triangle arithmétique treatise arithmetical triangle 1653 described convenient tabular presentation binomial coefficients now called pascal's triangle
triangle also represented 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 6 10 15 3 4 10 20 4 5 15 5 6 6 defines numbers triangle recursion call number m + th row n + th column tmn

pascal concludes proof 1654 proved pascal's identity relating sums p-th powers first n positive integers p = 0 2 … k
1654 prompted friend chevalier de méré corresponded pierre de fermat subject gambling problems collaboration born mathematical theory probabilities
specific problem two players want finish game early given current circumstances game want divide stakes fairly based chance each winning game point
discussion notion expected value introduced
pascal later pensées used probabilistic argument pascal's wager justify belief god virtuous life
work done fermat pascal calculus probabilities laid important groundwork leibniz' formulation calculus
after religious experience 1654 pascal mostly gave up work mathematics
philosophy mathematics pascal's major contribution philosophy mathematics came de l'esprit géométrique geometrical spirit originally written preface geometry textbook famous petites-ecoles de port-royal little schools port-royal
work unpublished until over century after death
here pascal looked issue discovering truths arguing ideal such method found propositions already established truths
same time however claimed impossible because such established truths require other truths back them up—first principles therefore cannot reached
based pascal argued procedure used geometry perfect possible certain principles assumed other propositions developed them
nevertheless there no way know assumed principles true
pascal also used de l'esprit géométrique develop theory definition
distinguished definitions conventional labels defined writer definitions within language understood everyone because naturally designate their referent
second type characteristic philosophy essentialism
pascal claimed definitions first type important science mathematics arguing those fields should adopt philosophy formalism formulated descartes
de l'art de persuader art persuasion pascal looked deeper geometry's axiomatic method specifically question how people come convinced axioms upon later conclusions based
pascal agreed montaigne achieving certainty these axioms conclusions through human methods impossible
asserted these principles grasped through intuition fact underscored necessity submission god searching out truths
contributions physical sciences portrait pascal illustration apocryphal pascal's barrel experiment pascal's work fields study hydrodynamics hydrostatics centered principles hydraulic fluids
inventions include hydraulic press using hydraulic pressure multiply force syringe
proved hydrostatic pressure depends weight fluid elevation difference
demonstrated principle attaching thin tube barrel full water filling tube water up level third floor building
caused barrel leak became known pascal's barrel experiment
1646 pascal learned evangelista torricelli's experimentation barometers
having replicated experiment involved placing tube filled mercury upside down bowl mercury pascal questioned force kept mercury tube filled space above mercury tube
time most scientists contended rather vacuum invisible matter present
based aristotelian notion creation thing substance whether visible invisible substance forever motion
furthermore everything motion must moved something aristotle declared
therefore aristotelian trained scientists pascal's time vacuum impossibility
how so? proof pointed out light passed through so-called vacuum glass tube
aristotle how everything moved must moved something
therefore since there invisible something move light through glass tube there no vacuum tube
glass tube anywhere else
vacuums absence any everything simply impossibility
following experimentation vein 1647 pascal produced experiences nouvelles touchant le vide new experiments vacuum detailed basic rules describing degree various liquids supported air pressure
also provided reasons why indeed vacuum above column liquid barometer tube
19 september 1648 after many months pascal's friendly insistent prodding florin périer husband pascal's elder sister gilberte finally able carry out fact-finding mission vital pascal's theory
account written périer reads weather chancy last saturday
[but] around five o'clock morning
puy-de-dôme visible
decided give try
several important people city clermont asked me let them know make ascent
delighted them me great work
eight o'clock met gardens minim fathers lowest elevation town
first poured 16 pounds quicksilver
then took several glass tubes
each four feet long hermetically sealed end opened other
then placed them vessel [of quicksilver]
found quick silver stood 3½ lines above quicksilver vessel
repeated experiment two times while standing same spot
[they] produced same result each time
attached tubes vessel marked height quicksilver
asked father chastin minim brothers
watch any changes should occur through day
taking other tube portion quick silver
walked top puy-de-dôme 500 fathoms higher monastery upon experiment
found quicksilver reached height 23 2 lines
repeated experiment five times care
each different points summit
found same height quicksilver
each case
pascal replicated experiment paris carrying barometer up top bell tower church saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie height fifty meters
mercury dropped two lines
face criticism invisible matter must exist pascal's empty space pascal reply estienne noel gave 17 th century's major statements scientific method striking anticipation idea popularised karl popper scientific theories characterised their falsifiability order show hypothesis evident does suffice phenomena follow instead leads something contrary single phenomena suffices establish falsity
insistence existence vacuum also led conflict other prominent scientists including descartes
