first manifested mathematical abilities while secondary school warsaw's szkoła mazowiecka
nevertheless entered university warsaw 1918 intending study biology
after poland regained independence 1918 warsaw university came under leadership jan łukasiewicz stanisław leśniewski wacław sierpiński quickly became world-leading research institution logic foundational mathematics philosophy mathematics
leśniewski recognized tarski's potential mathematician encouraged abandon biology
henceforth tarski attended courses taught łukasiewicz sierpiński stefan mazurkiewicz tadeusz kotarbiński became person ever complete doctorate under leśniewski's supervision
tarski leśniewski soon grew cool each other
however later life tarski reserved warmest praise kotarbiński mutual
1923 alfred teitelbaum brother wacław changed their surname tarski
years later alfred met another alfred tarski northern california
tarski brothers also converted roman catholicism poland's dominant religion
alfred even though avowed agnostic
tarski polish nationalist saw himself pole wished fully accepted such — later america spoke polish home
after becoming youngest person ever complete doctorate warsaw university tarski taught logic polish pedagogical institute mathematics logic university served łukasiewicz's assistant
because these positions poorly paid tarski also taught mathematics warsaw secondary school before world war ii uncommon european intellectuals research caliber teach high school
hence 1923 departure united states 1939 tarski several textbooks many papers number them ground-breaking also while supporting himself primarily teaching high-school mathematics
1929 tarski married fellow teacher maria witkowska pole catholic background
she worked courier army polish-soviet war
two children son jan became physicist daughter ina married mathematician andrzej ehrenfeucht
tarski applied chair philosophy lwów university bertrand russell's recommendation awarded leon chwistek
1930 tarski visited university vienna lectured karl menger's colloquium met kurt gödel
thanks fellowship able return vienna during first half 1935 work menger's research group
vienna traveled paris present ideas truth first meeting unity science movement outgrowth vienna circle
1937 tarski applied chair poznań university chair abolished
tarski's ties unity science movement likely saved life because resulted being invited address unity science congress held september 1939 harvard university
thus left poland august 1939 last ship sail poland united states before german soviet invasion poland outbreak world war ii
tarski left reluctantly because leśniewski died few months before creating vacancy tarski hoped fill
oblivious nazi threat left wife children warsaw
see them again until 1946
during war nearly extended family died hands german occupying authorities
once united states tarski held number temporary teaching research positions harvard university 1939 city college new york 1940 thanks guggenheim fellowship institute advanced study princeton 1942 again met gödel
1942 tarski joined mathematics department university california berkeley spent rest career
tarski became american citizen 1945
although emeritus 1968 taught until 1973 supervised ph
candidates until death
berkeley tarski acquired reputation awesome demanding teacher fact noted many observers seminars berkeley quickly became famous world mathematical logic
students many whom became distinguished mathematicians noted awesome energy coax cajole their best work out them demanding highest standards clarity precision
tarski extroverted quick-witted strong-willed energetic sharp-tongued
preferred research collaborative — sometimes working night colleague — very fastidious priority
charismatic leader teacher known brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style tarski intimidatingly high standards students same time very encouraging particularly women — contrast general trend
students frightened away circle disciples remained many whom became world-renowned leaders field

tarski presided over association symbolic logic 1944–46 international union history philosophy science 1956–57
also honorary editor algebra universalis
mathematician tarski's mathematical interests exceptionally broad
collected papers run 2500 pages most them mathematics logic
concise survey tarski's mathematical logical accomplishments former student solomon feferman see interludes i–vi feferman feferman
tarski's first paper published 19 years old set theory subject returned throughout life
1924 stefan banach proved accepts axiom choice ball cut finite number pieces then reassembled ball larger size alternatively reassembled two balls whose sizes each equal original
result now called banach–tarski paradox
decision method elementary algebra geometry tarski showed method quantifier elimination first-order theory real numbers under addition multiplication decidable
while result appeared 1948 dates back 1930 mentioned tarski 1931
very curious result because alonzo church proved 1936 peano arithmetic theory natural numbers decidable
peano arithmetic also incomplete gödel's incompleteness theorem
1953 undecidable theories tarski et al
showed many mathematical systems including lattice theory abstract projective geometry closure algebras undecidable
theory abelian groups decidable non-abelian groups
1920 s 30 s tarski often taught high school geometry
using ideas mario pieri 1926 tarski devised original axiomatization plane euclidean geometry considerably concise hilbert's
tarski's axioms form first-order theory devoid set theory whose individuals points having two primitive relations
1930 proved theory decidable because mapped another theory already proved decidable namely first-order theory real numbers
1929 showed much euclidean solid geometry recast first-order theory whose individuals spheres primitive notion single primitive binary relation contained two axioms among other things imply containment partially orders spheres
relaxing requirement individuals spheres yields formalization mereology far easier exposit lesniewski's variant
near end life tarski very long letter published tarski givant 1999 summarizing work geometry
cardinal algebras studied algebras whose models include arithmetic cardinal numbers
ordinal algebras sets out algebra additive theory order types
cardinal ordinal addition commutes
1941 tarski published important paper binary relations began work relation algebra metamathematics occupied tarski students much balance life
while exploration closely related work roger lyndon uncovered important limitations relation algebra tarski also showed tarski givant 1987 relation algebra express most axiomatic set theory peano arithmetic
introduction relation algebra see maddux 2006
late 1940 s tarski students devised cylindric algebras first-order logic two-element boolean algebra classical sentential logic
work culminated two monographs tarski henkin monk 1971 1985
logician tarski's student vaught ranked tarski four greatest logicians time — along aristotle gottlob frege kurt gödel
however tarski often expressed great admiration charles sanders peirce particularly pioneering work logic relations
tarski produced axioms logical consequence worked deductive systems algebra logic theory definability
semantic methods culminated model theory number berkeley students developed 1950 s 60 s radically transformed hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics
[tarski's] view metamathematics became similar any mathematical discipline
concepts results mathematized actually integrated mathematics
tarski destroyed borderline metamathematics mathematics
objected restricting role metamathematics foundations mathematics
tarski's 1936 article concept logical consequence argued conclusion argument will follow logically premises every model premises model conclusion
1937 published paper presenting clearly views nature purpose deductive method role logic scientific studies
high school undergraduate teaching logic axiomatics culminated classic short text published first polish then german translation finally 1941 english translation introduction logic methodology deductive sciences
tarski's 1969 truth proof considered both gödel's incompleteness theorems tarski's undefinability theorem mulled over their consequences axiomatic method mathematics
truth formalized languages 1933 tarski published very long paper polish titled pojęcie prawdy w językach nauk dedukcyjnych setting out mathematical definition truth formal languages
1935 german translation titled wahrheitsbegriff den formalisierten sprachen concept truth formalized languages sometimes shortened wahrheitsbegriff

brief discussion content see convention t also t-schema
recent philosophical debate examines extent tarski's theory truth formalized languages seen correspondence theory truth
debate centers how read tarski's condition material adequacy truth definition
condition requires truth theory following theorems sentences p language truth being defined p true p
p proposition expressed p debate amounts whether read sentences form such snow white true snow white expressing merely deflationary theory truth embodying truth substantial property see kirkham 1992
important realize tarski's theory truth formalized languages examples natural language illustrations use tarski's theory truth
logical consequence 1936 tarski published polish german versions lecture given preceding year international congress scientific philosophy paris
new english translation paper tarski 2002 highlights many differences german polish versions paper corrects number mistranslations tarski 1983
publication set out modern model-theoretic definition semantic logical consequence least basis
whether tarski's notion entirely modern turns whether intended admit models varying domains particular models domains different cardinalities
question matter debate current philosophical literature
john etchemendy stimulated much recent discussion tarski's treatment varying domains
tarski ends pointing out definition logical consequence depends upon division terms logical extra-logical expresses skepticism any such objective division will forthcoming
logical notions? thus viewed continuing concept logical consequence
work logical notions another theory tarski's attracting attention recent philosophical literature outlined logical notions? tarski 1986
published version talk gave originally 1966 london later 1973 buffalo edited without direct involvement john corcoran
became most cited paper journal history philosophy logic
talk tarski proposed demarcation logical operations calls notions non-logical
suggested criteria derived erlangen programme german 19 th century mathematician felix klein
mautner 1946 possibly article portuguese mathematician sebastiao e silva anticipated tarski applying erlangen program logic
program classified various types geometry euclidean geometry affine geometry topology etc
type one-one transformation space onto itself left objects geometrical theory invariant
one-to-one transformation functional map space onto itself every point space associated mapped other point space
rotate 30 degrees magnify factor 2 intuitive descriptions simple uniform one-one transformations
continuous transformations give rise objects topology similarity transformations those euclidean geometry
range permissible transformations becomes broader range objects able distinguish preserved application transformations becomes narrower
similarity transformations fairly narrow preserve relative distance points thus allow us distinguish relatively many things e
equilateral triangles non-equilateral triangles
continuous transformations intuitively thought transformations allow non-uniform stretching compression bending twisting no ripping glueing allow us distinguish polygon annulus ring hole centre allow us distinguish two polygons each other
tarski's proposal demarcate logical notions considering possible one-to-one transformations automorphisms domain onto itself
domain meant universe discourse model semantic theory logic
identifies truth value true domain set truth-value false empty set then following operations counted logical under proposal truth-functions truth-functions admitted proposal
includes limited n-ary truth-functions finite n
also admits truth-functions any infinite number places
individuals no individuals provided domain least two members
predicates one-place total null predicates former having members domain extension latter having no members domain extension two-place total null predicates former having set ordered pairs domain members extension latter empty set extension two-place identity predicate set order-pairs <aa> extension member domain two-place diversity predicate set order pairs <ab> distinct members domain n-ary predicates general predicates definable identity predicate together conjunction disjunction negation up any ordinality finite infinite quantifiers tarski explicitly discusses monadic quantifiers points out such numerical quantifiers admitted under proposal
these include standard universal existential quantifiers well numerical quantifiers such exactly four finitely many uncountably many four 9 million example
while tarski does enter issue also clear polyadic quantifiers admitted under proposal
these quantifiers like given two predicates fx gy morex says things f g
set-theoretic relations relations such inclusion intersection union applied subsets domain logical present sense
set membership tarski ended lecture discussion whether set membership relation counted logical sense
given reduction most mathematics set theory effect question whether most mathematics part logic
pointed out set membership logical set theory developed along lines type theory extralogical set theory set out axiomatically canonical zermelo–fraenkel set theory
logical notions higher order while tarski confined discussion operations first-order logic there nothing proposal necessarily restricts first-order logic
tarski likely restricted attention first-order notions talk given non-technical audience
higher-order quantifiers predicates admitted well
ways present proposal obverse lindenbaum tarski 1936 proved logical operations russell whitehead's principia mathematica invariant under one-to-one transformations domain onto itself
present proposal also employed tarski givant 1987
solomon feferman vann mc gee further discussed tarski's proposal work published after death
feferman 1999 raises problems proposal suggests cure replacing tarski's preservation automorphisms preservation arbitrary homomorphisms
essence suggestion circumvents difficulty tarski's proposal dealing sameness logical operation across distinct domains given cardinality across domains distinct cardinalities
feferman's proposal results radical restriction logical terms compared tarski's original proposal
particular ends up counting logical those operators standard first-order logic without identity
mc gee 1996 provides precise account operations logical sense tarski's proposal terms expressibility language extends first-order logic allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions disjunctions quantification over arbitrarily many variables
arbitrarily includes countable infinity
