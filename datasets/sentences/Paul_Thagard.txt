coherence thagard proposed many cognitive functions including perception analogy explanation decision-making planning etc
understood form maximum coherence computation
thagard together karsten verbeurgt put forth particular formalization concept coherence constraint satisfaction problem
model posits coherence operates over set representational elements e
propositions images etc
either fit together cohere resist fitting together incohere
two elements p q cohere connected positive constraint two elements incohere connected negative constraint
furthermore constraints weighted
each constraint there positive weight
according thagard coherence maximization involves partitioning elements accepted rejected elements such way maximum number maximum weight constraints satisfied
here positive constraint satisfied either both accepted both rejected
negative constraint satisfied element acceptedsay other rejected
philosophy science there decrease interest demarcation problem recent years
part problem many suspect intractable problem since many previous attempts come up short
example many obvious examples pseudoscience shown falsifiable verifiable revisable
therefore many previously proposed demarcation criteria judged particularly reliable
thagard proposed another set principles try overcome these difficulties
according thagard's method theory scientific less progressive alternative theories over long period time faces many unsolved problems community practitioners makes little attempt develop theory towards solutions problems shows no concern attempts evaluate theory relation others selective considering confirmations disconfirmations
