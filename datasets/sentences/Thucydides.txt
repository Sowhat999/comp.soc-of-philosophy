evidence classical period thucydides identifies himself athenian telling us father's name olorus athenian deme halimous
survived plague athens killed pericles many other athenians
also records owned gold mines scapte hyle literally dug woodland coastal area thrace opposite island thasos
ruins amphipolis envisaged e
cousinéry 1831 bridge over strymon city fortifications acropolis because influence thracian region thucydides sent strategos general thasos 424 bc
during winter 424–423 bc spartan general brasidas attacked amphipolis half-day's sail west thasos thracian coast instigating battle amphipolis
eucles athenian commander amphipolis sent thucydides help
brasidas aware thucydides's presence thasos influence people amphipolis afraid help arriving sea acted quickly offer moderate terms amphipolitans their surrender accepted
thus thucydides arrived amphipolis already under spartan control
amphipolis considerable strategic importance news fall caused great consternation athens
blamed thucydides although claimed fault simply unable reach time
because failure save amphipolis sent exile lived through whole being age comprehend events giving my attention them order know exact truth them
also my fate exile my country twenty years after my command amphipolis being present both parties especially peloponnesians reason my exile leisure observe affairs somewhat particularly
using status exile athens travel freely among peloponnesian allies able view war perspective both sides
during exile athens thucydides most famous work history peloponnesian war
because exile during time free speak mind
also conducted important research history during time having claimed pursued project thought greatest wars waged among greeks terms scale
thucydides own life few other facts available reliable contemporary sources
herodotus name όloros thucydides's father's name connected thrace thracian royalty
thucydides probably connected through family athenian statesman general miltiades son cimon leaders old aristocracy supplanted radical democrats
cimon's maternal grandfather's name also olorus making connection exceedingly likely
another thucydides lived before historian also linked thrace making family connection them very likely well
finally herodotus confirms connection thucydides's family mines scapté hýlē
combining fragmentary evidence available seems family owned large estate thrace even contained gold mines allowed family considerable lasting affluence
security continued prosperity wealthy estate must necessitated formal ties local kings chieftains explains adoption distinctly thracian royal name όloros family
once exiled thucydides took permanent residence estate given ample income gold mines able dedicate himself full-time history writing research including many fact-finding trips
essence well-connected gentleman considerable resources then retired political military spheres decided fund own historical project
later sources remaining evidence thucydides's life comes rather less reliable later ancient sources
according pausanias someone named oenobius able get law passed allowing thucydides return athens presumably sometime shortly after city's surrender end war 404 bc
pausanias goes say thucydides murdered way back athens
many doubt account seeing evidence suggest lived late 397 bc
plutarch claims remains returned athens placed cimon's family vault
abrupt end thucydides's narrative breaks off middle year 411 bc traditionally interpreted indicating died while writing book although other explanations put forward
bust pericles inferences thucydides's character drawn due caution book
sardonic sense humour evident throughout during description athenian plague remarks old athenians seemed remember rhyme dorian war come great death
claimed rhyme actually [death by] famine starvation limos greek λιμός remembered [death by] pestilence loimos greek λοιμός due current plague
thucydides then remarks should another dorian war come time attended great dearth rhyme will remembered dearth any mention death forgotten
thucydides admired pericles approving power over people showing marked distaste demagogues followed
approve democratic mob nor radical democracy pericles ushered considered democracy acceptable guided good leader
thucydides's presentation events generally even-handed example does minimize negative effect own failure amphipolis
occasionally however strong passions break through scathing appraisals demagogues cleon hyperbolus
cleon sometimes connected thucydides's exile
thucydides clearly moved suffering inherent war concerned excesses human nature prone such circumstances evident analysis atrocities committed during civil conflict corcyra includes phrase war violent teacher greek πόλεμος βίαιος διδάσκαλος

history peloponnesian war continued modified well beyond end war 404 exemplified reference book
13 conclusion peloponnesian war 404 bce seven years after last events main text thucydides' history
thucydides generally regarded first true historians
like predecessor herodotus known father history thucydides places high value eyewitness testimony writes events himself probably took part
also assiduously consulted written documents interviewed participants events recorded
unlike herodotus whose stories often teach foolish arrogance invites wrath gods thucydides does acknowledge divine intervention human affairs
thucydides exerted wide historiographical influence subsequent hellenistic roman historians though exact description style relation many successive historians remains unclear
readers antiquity often placed continuation stylistic legacy history writings thucydides' putative intellectual successor xenophon
such readings often described xenophon's treatises attempts finish thucydides' history
many these interpretations however garnered significant scepticism among modern scholars such dillery spurn view interpreting xenophon qua thucydides arguing latter's modern history defined constructed based literary historical themes antithetical former's account hellenica diverges hellenic historiographical tradition absence preface introduction text associated lack overarching concept unifying history
noteworthy difference thucydides's method writing history modern historians thucydides's inclusion lengthy formal speeches himself states literary reconstructions rather actual quotations — perhaps believed ought
arguably done gist otherwise known — whereas today there plethora documentation — written records archives recording technology historians consult
therefore thucydides's method served rescue mostly oral sources oblivion
know how these historical figures actually spoke
thucydides's recreation uses heroic stylistic register
celebrated example pericles' funeral oration heaps honour dead includes defence democracy whole earth sepulchre famous men honoured columns inscriptions their own land foreign nations memorials graven stone hearts minds men
243 stylistically placement passage also serves heighten contrast description plague athens immediately following graphically emphasizes horror human mortality thereby conveying powerful sense verisimilitude though many lay unburied birds beasts touch them died after tasting them [
bodies dying men lay upon another half-dead creatures reeled streets gathered round fountains their longing water
sacred places also quartered themselves full corpses persons died there just disaster passed bounds men knowing become them became equally contemptuous gods' property gods' dues
burial rites before use entirely upset buried bodies best
many want proper appliances through many their friends having died already recourse most shameless sepultures sometimes getting start those raised pile threw their own dead body upon stranger's pyre ignited sometimes tossed corpse carrying top another burning went off
252 thucydides omits discussion arts literature social milieu events book take place himself grew up
saw himself recording event period went considerable lengths exclude deemed frivolous extraneous
philosophical outlook influences paul shorey thematizes thucydides' outlook calling cynic devoid moral sensibility
addition notes thucydides conceived man's nature strictly determined physical social environments alongside basic desires
thucydides' work indicates influence teachings sophists contributes substantially thinking character history possible evidence includes skeptical ideas concerning justice morality
there also elements within history - such views nature revolving around factual empirical non-anthropomorphic - permit stipulation awareness subscription views philosophers like anaxagores democritus
there also evidence knowledge concerning corpus hippocratic medical writings
thucydides especially interested relationship human intelligence judgment fortune necessity history life too irrational incalculable predict
critical interpretation bust thucydides residing royal ontario museum toronto scholars traditionally view thucydides recognizing teaching lesson democracies need leadership leadership dangerous democracy
leo strauss city man locates problem nature athenian democracy itself argued thucydides deeply ambivalent view hand thucydides's own wisdom made possible periclean democracy effect liberating individual daring enterprise questioning spirit same liberation permitting growth limitless political ambition led imperialism eventually civic strife
canadian historian charles norris cochrane 1889–1945 thucydides's fastidious devotion observable phenomena focus cause effect strict exclusion other factors anticipates twentieth century scientific positivism
cochrane son physician speculated thucydides generally especially describing plague athens influenced methods thinking early medical writers such hippocrates kos
after world war ii classical scholar jacqueline de romilly pointed out problem athenian imperialism thucydides's central preoccupations situated history context greek thinking international politics
since appearance her study other scholars further examined thucydides's treatment realpolitik
recently scholars questioned perception thucydides simply father realpolitik
instead brought fore literary qualities history see belonging narrative tradition homer hesiod concerned concepts justice suffering found plato aristotle problematized aeschylus sophocles
richard ned lebow terms thucydides last tragedians stating thucydides drew heavily epic poetry tragedy construct history surprisingly also constructed narrative
view blind immoderate behaviour athenians indeed other actors though perhaps intrinsic human nature ultimately leads their downfall
thus history serve warning future leaders prudent putting them notice someone scrutinizing their actions historian's objectivity rather chronicler's flattery
finally question recently raised whether thucydides greatly fundamentally concerned matter religion
contrary herodotus portrays gods active agents human affairs thucydides attributes existence divine entirely needs political life
gods seen existing minds men
religion such reveals itself history simply type social behaviour among others permeates whole social existence permitting emergence justice
thucydides versus herodotus herodotus thucydides thucydides immediate predecessor herodotus both exerted significant influence western historiography
thucydides does mention counterpart name famous introductory statement thought refer hear history rehearsed there inserted no fables shall perhaps delightful
desires look truth things done according condition humanity may done again least their like shall find enough herein make think profitable
compiled rather everlasting possession rehearsed prize
122 herodotus records histories events persian wars also geographical ethnographical information well fables related during extensive travels
typically passes no definitive judgment heard
case conflicting unlikely accounts presents both sides says believes then invites readers decide themselves
work herodotus reported recited festivals prizes awarded example during games olympia
herodotus views history source moral lessons conflicts wars misfortunes flowing initial acts injustice perpetuated through cycles revenge
contrast thucydides claims confine himself factual reports contemporary political military events based unambiguous first-hand eye-witness accounts although unlike herodotus does reveal sources
thucydides views life exclusively political life history terms political history
conventional moral considerations play no role analysis political events while geographic ethnographic aspects omitted best secondary importance
subsequent greek historians — such ctesias diodorus strabo polybius plutarch — held up thucydides's writings model truthful history
lucian refers thucydides having given greek historians their law requiring them say done ὡς ἐπράχθη
greek historians fourth century bc accepted history political contemporary history proper domain historian
cicero calls herodotus father history yet greek writer plutarch moralia ethics denigrated herodotus notably calling philobarbaros barbarian lover' detriment greeks
