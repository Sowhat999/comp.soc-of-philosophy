1969 while serving chairman academic freedom committee academic senate university california supported university dispute students over people's park
campus war sympathetic look university agony 1971 searle investigates causes behind campus protests era
declares attacked both house un-american activities committee
several radical polemicists
stylistically attacks interestingly similar
both rely heavily insinuation innuendo both display hatred might almost say terror close analysis dissection argument
asserts my wife threatened other members administration assassinated violently attacked
shortly after 9/11 searle article claiming 9/11 particular event long-term struggle against forces intractably opposed united states signalled support aggressive neoconservative interventionist foreign policy
called realization us more-or-less permanent state war these forces
moreover probable course action deny terrorists use foreign territory stage their attacks
finally alluded long-term nature conflict blamed attacks lack american resolve deal forcefully america's enemies over past several decades
philosophy speech acts searle's early work great deal establish reputation speech acts

strawson john rawls william p
alston maintained sentence meaning consists sets regulative rules requiring speaker perform illocutionary act indicated sentence such acts involve utterance sentence indicates performs act means says c addresses audience vicinity
1969 book speech acts searle sets out combine these elements give account illocutionary acts
there provides analysis considers prototypical illocutionary act promising offers sets semantical rules intended represent linguistic meaning devices indicating further illocutionary act types
among concepts presented book distinction illocutionary force propositional content utterance
searle does precisely define former such rather introduces several possible illocutionary forces example
according searle sentences
sam smokes habitually
does sam smoke habitually? sam smoke habitually! sam smoked habitually!
each indicate same propositional content sam smoking habitually differ illocutionary force indicated respectively statement question command expression desire
according later account searle presents intentionality 1983 differs important ways suggested speech acts illocutionary acts characterised their having conditions satisfaction idea adopted strawson's 1971 paper meaning truth direction fit idea adopted elizabeth anscombe
example statement john bought two candy bars satisfied true
john buy two candy bars
contrast command john buy two candy bars! satisfied john carries out action purchasing two candy bars
searle refers first having word-to-world direction fit since words supposed change accurately represent world second having world-to-word direction fit since world supposed change match words
there also double direction fit relationship goes both ways null zero direction fit goes neither way because propositional content presupposed i'm sorry ate john's candy bars
foundations illocutionary logic 1985 daniel vanderveken searle prominently uses notion illocutionary point
searle's speech-act theory challenged several thinkers variety ways
collections articles referring searle's account found burkhardt 1990 lepore / van gulick
searle–derrida debate see also limited inc early 1970 s searle brief exchange jacques derrida regarding speech-act theory
exchange characterized degree mutual hostility philosophers each whom accused other having misunderstood basic points
[citation needed] searle particularly hostile derrida's deconstructionist framework much later refused let response derrida printed along derrida's papers 1988 collection limited inc
searle consider derrida's approach legitimate philosophy even intelligible writing argued want legitimize deconstructionist point view dedicating any attention
consequently critics considered exchange series elaborate misunderstandings rather debate while others seen either derrida searle gaining upper hand
level hostility seen searle's statement mistake regard derrida's discussion austin confrontation two prominent philosophical traditions derrida replied sentence sentence reply subscribe
commentators frequently interpreted exchange prominent example confrontation analytical continental philosophy
debate began 1972 paper signature event context derrida analyzed j
austin's theory illocutionary act
while sympathetic austin's departure purely denotational account language includes force derrida sceptical framework normativity employed austin
argued austin missed fact any speech event framed structure absence words left unsaid due contextual constraints iterability constraints given past
derrida argued focus intentionality speech-act theory misguided because intentionality restricted already established possible intention
also took issue way austin excluded study fiction non-serious parasitic speech wondering whether exclusion because austin considered these speech genres governed different structures meaning simply due lack interest
brief reply derrida reiterating differences reply derrida searle argued derrida's critique unwarranted because assumed austin's theory attempted give full account language meaning aim much narrower
searle considered omission parasitic discourse forms justified narrow scope austin's inquiry
searle agreed derrida's proposal intentionality presupposes iterability apply same concept intentionality used derrida being unable unwilling engage continental conceptual apparatus
turn caused derrida criticize searle being sufficiently familiar phenomenological perspectives intentionality
searle also argued derrida's disagreement austin turned having misunderstood austin's type–token distinction failure understand austin's concept failure relation performativity
critics suggested searle being grounded analytical tradition unable engage derrida's continental phenomenological tradition fault unsuccessful nature exchange
derrida response searle c
limited inc ridiculed searle's positions
claiming clear sender searle's message established suggested searle formed austin société à responsabilité limitée limited liability company due ways ambiguities authorship within searle's reply circumvented very speech act reply
searle reply
later 1988 derrida tried review position critiques austin searle reiterating found constant appeal normality analytical tradition problematic
debate derrida praises austin's work argues wrong banish austin calls infelicities normal operation language
infelicity instance occurs cannot known whether given speech act sincere merely citational therefore possibly ironic etc
derrida argues every iteration necessarily citational due graphematic nature speech writing language work without ever-present ineradicable possibility such alternate readings
derrida takes searle task attempt get around issue grounding final authority speaker's inaccessible intention
derrida argues intention cannot possibly govern how iteration signifies once becomes hearable readable
speech acts borrow language whose significance determined historical-linguistic context alternate possibilities context makes possible
significance derrida argues cannot altered governed whims intention
1995 searle gave brief reply derrida construction social reality
called derrida's conclusion preposterous stated derrida far tell does argument
simply declares there nothing outside texts
searle's reference here anything forwarded debate mistranslation phrase il n'y pas de hors-texte there no outside-text appears derrida's grammatology
intentionality background searle defines intentionality power minds represent see correspondence theory truth stand things properties states affairs world
nature intentionality important part discussions searle's philosophy mind
searle emphasizes word ‘intentionality part mind directed to/from/about objects relations world independent mind should confused word ‘intensionality’ logical property sentences pass test 'extensinalidade'
intentionality essay philosophy mind 1983 searle applies certain elements accounts illocutionary acts investigation intentionality
searle also introduces technical term background according source much philosophical discussion though arguing thesis almost twenty years searle writes many people whose opinions respect still disagree me
background calls set abilities capacities tendencies dispositions humans themselves intentional states
thus someone asks us cut cake know use knife someone asks us cut grass know use lawnmower vice versa even though actual request include detail
searle sometimes supplements reference background concept network one's network other beliefs desires other intentional states necessary any particular intentional state make sense
searle argues concept background similar concepts provided several other thinkers including wittgenstein's private language argument work later wittgenstein large part background bourdieu's habitus
give example two chess players might engaged bitter struggle board share sorts background presuppositions will take turns move no else will intervene both playing same rules fire alarm won't go off board won't suddenly disintegrate their opponent won't magically turn grapefruit indefinitely
most these possibilities won't occurred either player searle thinks background must unconscious though elements called consciousness fire alarm does go off say
debate derrida searle argued against derrida's notion statement disjoined original intentionality author example no longer connected original author while still being able produce meaning
searle maintained even see written statement no knowledge authorship still impossible escape question intentionality because meaningful sentence just standing possibility intentional speech act
searle ascribing intentionality statement basic requirement attributing any meaning
consciousness building upon views intentionality searle presents view concerning consciousness book rediscovery mind 1992
argues starting behaviorism early influential scientific view succeeded many later accounts searle also dismisses much modern philosophy tried deny existence consciousness little success
intentionality parodies several alternative theories consciousness replacing their accounts intentionality comparable accounts hand no think saying example having hand just being disposed certain sorts behavior such grasping manual behaviorism hands defined entirely terms their causes effects manual functionalism system hand just certain computer state right sorts inputs outputs manual turing machine functionalism saying system hands just adopting certain stance toward manual stance
263 searle argues philosophy trapped false dichotomy hand world consists nothing objective particles fields force yet other hand consciousness clearly subjective first-person experience
searle says simply both true consciousness real subjective experience caused physical processes brain
view suggests might called biological naturalism
ontological subjectivity searle argued critics like daniel dennett claims insist discussing subjectivity unscientific because science presupposes objectivity making category error
perhaps goal science establish validate statements epistemically objective
whose truth discovered evaluated any interested party necessarily ontologically objective
searle calls any value judgment epistemically subjective
thus mc kinley prettier everest epistemically subjective whereas mc kinley higher everest epistemically objective
other words latter statement evaluable fact falsifiable understood 'background' criterion mountain height like 'the summit many meters above sea level'
no such criteria exist prettiness
beyond distinction searle thinks there certain phenomena including conscious experiences ontologically subjective
exist subjective experience
example although might subjective objective epistemic sense doctor's note patient suffers back pain ontologically objective claim counts medical diagnosis because existence back pain objective fact medical science
pain itself ontologically subjective experienced person having
searle goes affirm consciousness concerned existence appearance reality
view epistemic ontological senses objective/subjective cleanly separable crucial self-proclaimed biological naturalism
artificial intelligence see also chinese room philosophy artificial intelligence consequence biological naturalism want create conscious being will duplicate whatever physical processes brain goes through cause consciousness
searle thereby means contradict calls strong ai defined assumption soon certain kind software running computer conscious being thereby created
1980 searle presented chinese room argument purports prove falsity strong ai
familiarity turing test useful understanding issue
assume you speak chinese imagine yourself room two slits book scratch paper
someone slides you chinese characters through first slit you follow instructions book transcribing characters instructed onto scratch paper slide resulting sheet out second slit
people outside world appears room speaks chinese—they slide chinese statements slit get valid responses return—yet you understand word chinese
suggests according searle no computer ever understand chinese english because thought experiment suggests being able 'translate' chinese english does entail 'understanding' either chinese english person thought experiment hence computer able execute certain syntactic manipulations
stevan harnad argues searle's strong ai really just another name functionalism computationalism these positions real targets critique
functionalists claim consciousness defined set informational processes inside brain
follows anything carries out same informational processes human also conscious
thus computer program conscious run computer program say system ping-pong balls beer cups system equally conscious because running same information processes
searle argues impossible since consciousness physical property like digestion fire
no matter how good simulation digestion you build computer will digest anything no matter how well you simulate fire nothing will get burnt
contrast informational processes observer-relative observers pick out certain patterns world consider them information processes information processes things-in-the-world themselves
since exist physical level searle argues cannot causal efficacy thus cannot cause consciousness
there no physical law searle insists see equivalence personal computer series ping-pong balls beer cans pipe-and-water system implementing same program
social reality searle extended inquiries observer-relative phenomena trying understand social reality
searle begins arguing collective intentionality e
we're going walk distinct form intentionality simply reducible individual intentionality e
i'm going walk think thinks he's going walk me thinks think i'm going walk
searle's construction social reality 1995 addresses mystery how social constructs like baseball money exist world consisting physical particles fields force
adapting idea elizabeth anscombe brute facts searle distinguishes brute facts like height mountain institutional facts like score baseball game
aiming explanation social phenomena terms anscombe's notion argues society explained terms institutional facts institutional facts arise out collective intentionality through constitutive rules logical form x counts c
thus instance filling out ballot counts vote polling place getting many votes counts victory election getting victory counts being elected president presidential race etc
many sociologists however see searle's contributions social theory very significant
neil gross example argues searle's views society less reconstitution emile durkheim's theories social facts social institutions collective representations like
searle's ideas thus open same criticisms durkheim's
searle responded saying durkheim's work worse originally believed admitting read much durkheim's work because durkheim’s account seemed impoverished read any further work
stephen lukes however responded searle's response gross argues point point against allegations searle makes against durkheim essentially upholding argument gross searle's work bears great resemblance durkheim's
lukes attributes searle's miscomprehension durkheim's work fact searle quite simply never read durkheim
rationality rationality action 2001 searle argues standard notions rationality badly flawed
according calls classical model rationality seen something like train track you get point your beliefs desires rules rationality compel you way conclusion
searle doubts picture rationality holds generally
searle briefly critiques particular set these rules those mathematical decision theory
points out axioms require anyone valued quarter their life odds bet their life quarter
searle insists never take such bet believes stance perfectly rational
most attack directed against common conception rationality believes badly flawed
first argues reasons don't cause you anything because having sufficient reason wills doesn't force you thing
any decision situation experience gap our reasons our actions
example decide vote simply determine care most economic policy prefer candidate jones's economic policy
also make effort cast our vote
similarly every time guilty smoker lights cigarette aware succumbing their craving merely acting automatically exhale
gap makes us think freedom will
searle thinks whether really free will open question considers absence highly unappealing because makes feeling freedom will epiphenomenon highly unlikely evolutionary point view given biological cost
also says rational activity presupposes free will
second searle believes rationally things don't result our own desires
widely believed cannot derive ought
facts how world never tell you you should 'hume's law'
contrast far fact understood relating institution marriage promises commitments etc
understood system constitutive rules then should understood following institutional fact done institutional fact then understood opposed brute facts related hume's law
example searle believes fact you promised something means you should because making promise you participating constitutive rules arrange system promise making itself therefore understand shouldness implicit mere factual action promising
furthermore believes provides desire-independent reason action—if you order drink bar you should pay even you no desire
argument first made paper how derive 'ought' 'is' 1964 remains highly controversial even three decades later searle continued defend view
traditional metaphysical distinction fact value cannot captured linguistic distinction 'evaluative' 'descriptive' because such speech act notions already normative
third searle argues much rational deliberation involves adjusting our often inconsistent patterns desires decide outcomes other way around
while classical model start desire go paris greater saving money calculate cheapest way get there reality people balance niceness paris against costs travel decide desire visiting paris saving money value
hence believes rationality system rules adverb
see certain behavior rational no matter source our system rules derives finding patterns see rational
