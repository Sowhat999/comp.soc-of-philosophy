age seven memorized entire qur'an heart
age ten already exemplary student fields arabic grammar lexicography arabic literature under teacher niftawayh himself student ibn dawud's father
regard variant readings qur'an ibn dawud learned hafs al-duri student abu 'amr ibn al-'ala' ten primary transmitters qur'an
ibn dawud's classmate muhammad ibn jarir al-tabari also learned qur'an same study circle addition having student ibn dawud's father suggesting close relationship early despite their later rivalry
ibn dawud's relationship father complex
child ibn dawud bullied other children being given name poor little sparrow
complained father nickname father insisted names people things predestined god there no reason analyze meaning names order know established
father then actually affirmed nickname given other children emphasizing things occur according divine will
while ibn dawud father mean other children laughing own son known episode continued affect ibn dawud adulthood characteristic entire father-son relationship
academia judiciary upon father's death 884 ibn dawud took up dawud's teaching position baghdad
despite being fifteen years old still considered outstanding jurist four-hundred students father became own students
ibn dawud tendency speak using saj' form arabic rhymed prose everyday speech
caused difficulty many sought verdicts though regarded having lessened popularity
years after teaching position abbasid administration appointed judicial post western baghdad
death although ibn dawud generally considered died young exact date death matter dispute
masudi recorded ibn dawud's death 296 hijri corresponding 908 909 gregorian
encyclopaedia islam records death 294 hijri 909 gregorian yet two dates match
ibn khallikan recorded ibn dawud's death ramadan 9 297 hijri may 910 gregorian
while exact cause death known ibn dawud proclaimed deathbed confession teacher niftawayh dying broken heart due forbidden love another man
topic ibn dawud's affections topic much discussion confession such feelings unique among muslim theologians even up present era
setting death perhaps most vividly described piece biography
during final moments ibn dawud lied bed light filtering through grated window empty space floor blind nightingale sang gilded cage nearby described weary regrets yet also serene last moments
body ritually washed student ibn al-mughallis according islamic funeral rites
philosophy ibn dawud opponent using analogical reason juristic preference muslim jurisprudence
same time ibn dawud still upheld validity using inference order deduce religious verdicts
same views held father whom ibn dawud followed zahirite religious views
ibn dawud also rejected notion verdicts first generation muslims constitute source law
position specific zahirite rite being preferred view shafi'ites well
theology like father ibn dawud left theological works survived modern era
ibn dawud known involved public debates mu'tazila ancient muslim sect court caliph al-muwaffaq wasit
surprising considering mu'tazilites ill reception ibn dawud's father whose footsteps ibn dawud followed scorn mu'taziltes heaped upon zahirites general
known ibn dawud opposed theologically rather himself believed
nature soul book love ibn dawud quoted greek playwright aristophanes according plato's symposium held view soul person fallen love actually half soul
view bodies two people love each given half same soul god
later writers mistaken being ibn dawud's own belief though modern scholarship shown merely quoting speech philosophers almost derisive way rather ascribing belief himself
ibn dawud's own beliefs regarding soul never actually stated likely no different those held rest islamic orthodoxy time
opposition sufism ibn dawud like many within religious establishment time hostile toward sufism especially sufi metaphysics
901 declared mystic mansur al-hallaj heretic well-known verdict
initially ibn dawud's appeal caliph al-mu'tadid heeded hallaj able continue preaching ideas time
likely however ibn dawud's verdict contributing factor caliph al-muqtadir's ordering hallaj's execution
reception historically shi'ite writers especially ismaili shi'ites criticized ibn dawud rejecting usage analogical reason juristic preference religious verdicts while affirming inference
fatimid historian qadi al-nu'man particularly scathing accusing ibn dawud father contradicting themselves
works religion ibn dawud composed book topic principles muslim jurisprudence titled path knowledge jurisprudence
earliest works subject after shafi'i's risala primary basis nu'man's differences among schools law despite nu'man's criticisms ibn dawud
yaqut al-hamawi mentions chapter book regarding juristic consensus ibn dawud criticizes former companion tabari having contradictory views subject
like ibn dawud's other works path survived complete form modern era however large tracts quoted other works modern scholarship suggests al-nu'man's differences derived ibn dawud's book
interesting note despite their differences opinion tabari's own work principles jurisprudence clarification principles verdicts strongly resemblant path ibn dawud works dawud's father rather shafi'is work even post-9 th century works topic
contradicts common theme within genre also implies similarities extant yet non-mainstream zahirite school law extinct jariri school
addition path masudi ibn al-nadim both attribute three other works ibn dawud within field muslim jurisprudence book admonishment book excuse book refutation
latter book includes another critique views tabari
love late 9 th century ibn dawud composed book kitab al-zahrah while native city baghdad
work considered first arabic language works theory love
ibn duraid authored second ever comprehensive dictionary language ranked book along treatises love ibn abi tahir tayfur ibn qutaybah three most important works wanted become eloquent speaking writing
book organized anthology each chapter headed appropriate aphorism being devoted various phenomena relating true meaning love
although humanistic perspective theological ibn dawud's piety apparent chastity common theme
chapter eight book refined person will chaste opened alleged quote prophet muhammad praise admirers keep their affections secret
quote quite telling own personal feelings ibn dawud repeated shortly after confessed love another man deathbed
similarly opening chapter titled whose glances many sorrows prolonged indicating belief pursuing multiple objects affection will yield negative results
martyrdom chastity repeated theme ibn dawud's denial possibility divine-human mutual love
incomplete portions book still extant today though widely available
