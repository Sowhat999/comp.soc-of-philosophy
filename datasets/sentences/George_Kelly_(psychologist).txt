body kelly's work psychology personal constructs volume ii written 1955 kelly professor ohio state university
first three chapters book republished w
norton paperback 1963 consist theory personality covered most personality books
re-publication omitted kelly's assessment technique rep grid test method psychotherapy fixed role therapy rarely practiced form proposed
kelly believed each person their own idea word meant
someone say their sister shy word “shy” interpreted different ways depending person’s personal constructs already associated word “shy”
kelly wanted know how individual made sense world based their constructs
other hand kelly's fundamental view people naive scientists incorporated most later-developed forms cognitive-behavioral therapy blossomed late 70 s early 80 s intersubjective psychoanalysis leaned heavily kelly's phenomenological perspective notion schematic processing social information
kelly's personality theory distinguished time published two volumes drive theories such psychodynamic models hand behavioral theories other people seen solely motivated instincts such sexual aggressive drives learning history their need characterize predict events their social world
because constructs people developed construing experience potential change kelly's theory personality less deterministic drive theory learning theory
people conceivably change their view world doing change way interacted felt even others' reactions them
reason existential theory regarding humankind having choice reconstrue themselves concept kelly referred constructive alternativism
constructs provide certain order clarity prediction person's world
kelly referenced many philosophers two volumes theme new experience being once novel familiar due templates placed closely akin notion heraclitus step step same rivers
experience new familiar extent construed historically derived constructs
constructs bipolar categories way two things alike different third people employ understand world
examples such constructs attractive intelligent kind
construct implies contrast
individual categorizes others attractive intelligent kind opposite polarity implied
means such person may also evaluate others terms constructs ugly stupid cruel
cases person disordered construct system opposite polarity unexpressed idiosyncratic
importance particular construct varies among individuals
adaptiveness construct system measured how well applies situation hand useful predicting events
constructs used every situation because limited range range convenience
adaptive people continually revising updating their own constructs match new information data encounter their experience
kelly's personality theory ever laid out testable scientific treatise fundamental postulate set corollaries
[according whom?][dubious discuss] fundamental postulate person's processes psychologically channelized ways [or she] anticipates events
construction corollary person anticipates events construing their replications
means individuals anticipate events their social world perceiving similarity past event construing replication
experience corollary person's construction system varies successively construes replication events
dichotomy corollary person's construction system composed finite number dichotomous constructs
organization corollary each person characteristically evolves convenience anticipating events construction system embracing ordinal relationships constructs
range corollary construct convenient anticipation finite range events
modulation corollary variation person's construction system limited permeability constructs within whose range convenience variants lie
choice corollary person chooses himself alternative dichotomized construct through anticipates greater possibility extension definition system
individuality corollary persons differ each other their construction events
commonality corollary extent person employs construction experience similar employed another psychological processes similar other person
fragmentation corollary person may successively employ variety construction subsystems inferentially incompatible each other
sociality corollary extent person construes construction processes another may play role social process involving other person
disordered constructs those system construction useful predicting social events fails change accommodate new information
many ways kelly's theory psychopathology mental disorders similar elements define poor theory
disordered construct system does accurately predict events accommodate new data
also see corollaries theory personal constructs dimensions transitions transitional periods person's life occur she encounters situation changes her naive theory system construction way world ordered
create anxiety hostility and/or guilt also opportunities change one's constructs way views world
anxiety hostility guilt unique definitions meanings personal construct theory vol 486-534
anxiety develops person encounters situation her construct system does cover event unlike any she encountered
example such situation woman western united states accustomed earthquakes moves eastern united states experiences great anxiety because hurricane
while earthquake might greater magnitude she experiences greater anxiety hurricane because she no constructs deal such event
she caught her constructs down
similarly boy abused early childhood may constructs accommodate kindness others
such boy might experience anxiety outstretched hand others view benevolent
guilt dislodgement one's core constructs
person feels guilt she fails confirm constructs define her
definition guilt radically different other theories personality
kelly used example man regards others cow-like creatures making money giving milk
such man might construe role relationship others terms ability con favors money them
such man other psychologists might call ruthless psychopath see unable experience guilt feels guilt according kelly's theory unable con others then alienated core constructs
hostility attempting extort confirmation social prediction already failing
person encounters situation s/he expects outcome receives quite different s/he should change his/her theory constructs rather trying change situation match his/her constructs
person continually refuses modify her belief system accommodate new data fact tries change data acting bad faith hostility
hostility kelly's theory analogous scientist fudging her data
example might professor sees himself brilliant educator deals poor student reviews devaluing students means evaluation

kelly's concerns kelly like theory being compared other theories
often times people believed kelly’s personal constructs theory similar humanistic theories cognitive theories kelly thought theory own category theories
say kelly similar neisser “the father cognitive psychology” because both studied cognitive psychology characteristics others say kelly similar maslow creator maslow’s hierarchy needs because both studied humanistic psychology characteristics
although kelly’s research humanistic psychology characteristics also very unique own way
kelly hated being known cognitive psychologist much almost another book stating theory no link cognitive theories
kelly saw current theories personality loosely defined difficult test many clinical cases observer contributed diagnosis patient
you took your problems freudian analyst analysed freudian terms jungian interpret them jungian terms behaviourist interpret them terms conditioning
kelly acknowledged both therapist patient each bring unique set constructs bear consulting room
therefore therapist never completely objective construing her client's world
effective therapist however construed patient's material high level abstraction within patient's opposed therapist's system construction
therapist then comprehend ways patient saw world disordered help patient change her maladaptive constructs
