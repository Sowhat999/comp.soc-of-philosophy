karl rahner centre freiburg
1962 no prior warning rahner's superiors jesuit order under rome's pre-censorship meant publish lecture without advance permission
outspoken frank approach faith issues creative challenging stance theological foundations gotten trouble vatican authorities naturally tended traditionally minded especially issue unchangeable teachings church
basic objections roman authorities focused mainly rahner's views eucharist mariology however practical import pre-censorship decision voided november 1962 without any objection john xxiii appointed rahner peritus expert advisor second vatican council rahner complete access council numerous opportunities share thought participants
rahner's influence vatican ii thus widespread subsequently chosen seven theologians develop lumen gentium dogmatic explication doctrine church
council's receptiveness towards other religious traditions may linked rahner's notions renovation church god's universal salvific revelation desire support encourage ecumenical movement
during council rahner accepted chair christianity philosophy religion university munich taught there 1964 1967
subsequently after producing important lectures published grundkurs des glaubens foundations christian faith appointed chair dogmatic theology catholic theological faculty university münster stayed until retirement 1971
rahner then moved munich 1981 innsbruck remained next 3 years active writer lecturer also continuing active pastoral ministry
published several volumes 23 total english collected essays schriften zur theologie theological investigations expanded kleines theologisches wörterbuch theological dictionary co-authored other texts such unity churches actual possibility heinrich fries 1976 completed long-promised systematic work foundations christian faith
rahner fell ill exhaustion died 30 march 1984 age 80 after birthday celebration also honored scholarship
buried jesuit church holy trinity innsbruck
during years philosophical theological study teaching rahner produced 4000 written works
work karl rahner interviewed 1974 rahner's output extraordinarily voluminous
addition above-mentioned writings other major works include ten-volume encyclopaedia lexicon für theologie und kirche six-volume theological encyclopaedia sacramentum mundi many other books essays articles
addition own work reference texts rahner edited also added significantly general impact own theological views
basis rahner's theology human beings latent unthematic experience god any perception meaning transcendental experience
because proto-revelation recognizing distinctively special revelation such christian gospel possible
theology influenced second vatican council ground-breaking development generally seen modern understanding catholicism
foundations christian faith written near end life rahner's foundations christian faith grundkurs des glaubens most developed systematic works most published form essays
economic immanent trinity among most important essays trinity argues economic trinity immanent trinity immanent trinity economic trinity
say god communicates himself humanity economic trinity really divine life immanent trinity
rahner emphatic identity economic trinity immanent trinity does lead modalism because god communicate himself humanity threefold dreifaltige unless threefold reality
nonetheless theologians christian philosophers e
jürgen moltmann found teaching tend strongly modalist direction
god's self-communication rahner maintained fulfillment human existence consists receiving god's self-communication human being actually constituted divine self-communication
transfinalization rahner critic substance theory concerned finality liturgy
proposed instead rename transubstantiation transfinalization
however theory condemned pope paul vi encyclical mysterium fidei
awareness god basis rahner's theology human beings latent unthematic awareness god any experiences limitation knowledge freedom finite subjects
because such experience condition possibility knowledge freedom such rahner borrows language kant describe experience transcendental
transcendental experiential factor reveals closeness maréchal’s transcendental thomism
such extent rahner's idea natural knowledge god—what known reason prior advent special revelation
god approached asymptotically mode rahner calls absolute mystery
while may try furnish proofs god's existence these explicit proofs ultimately refer inescapable orientation towards mystery constitute—by transcendental necessity—the very nature human being
god absolute mystery rahner often prefers term mystery god
identifies god absolute being absolute mystery
best philosophy approaches god asymptotically evoking question whether attempts know god vain
line human asymptote mystery asymptote connect? rahner’s theology absolute mystery reveals himself self-communication
revelation however does resolve mystery increases cognizance god’s incomprehensibility
experiences mystery themselves point people absolute mystery “an always-ever-greater mystery
even heaven god will still incomprehensible mystery
homanisation incarnation rahner examines evolution work homanisation 1958 rev
title represents term coined deriving hominization theory man’s evolutionary origins
book's preface describes limits catholic theology respect evolution further giving summary official church teaching theory
author then continues next sections propound fundamental theology order elucidate background foundation church teaching
third section rahner raises philosophical theological questions relating concept becoming concept cause distinction spirit matter unity spirit matter concept operation creation spiritual soul
writing rahner does simply deal origin man existence future issues concern evolutionary theory
central rahner theological doctrine grace rahner constituent element man’s existence grace permanent modification human nature supernatural existential use heidegger term
accordingly rahner doubts real possibility state pure nature natura pura human existence without being involved grace
treating present existence man future human rahner affirms fulfillment human existence occurs receiving god's gift himself beatific vision end time present now seed grace
multiple incarnations rahner open prospect extraterrestrial intelligence idea cosmic evolution yielded sentient life forms other galaxies
logically raises rahner important questions philosophical ethical theological significance argues against any theological prohibition notion extraterrestrial life while separating existential significance such life forms angels
moreover rahner advances possibility multiple incarnations does delve given strong christological orientation theology does appear likely propended repetitions incarnation christ
incarnation-grace rahner heart christian doctrine co-reality incarnation-grace
incarnation grace appear technical terms describe central message gospel god communicated himself
self-communication god crucial rahner's view grace something other god celestial 'substance' god himself
event jesus christ according rahner center-point self-communication god
god insists rahner does communicate himself without rather grace constitutive element both objective reality revelation incarnate word subjective principle our hearing holy spirit
thus grace lies both sides—without within
mode grace rahner's particular interpretation mode grace makes itself present grace permanent modification human nature supernatural existential phrase borrowed heidegger
grace perceived light christianity constitutive element human existence
reason rahner denies possibility state pure nature natura pura human existence without being-involved grace according counterfactual
anonymous christianity anonymous christianity theological concept declares people never heard christian gospel might saved through christ
inspiration idea sometimes comes second vatican council's lumen gentium teaches those no fault their own know gospel christ church nevertheless seek god sincere heartand moved grace try their actions will know through dictates their conscience—those too may achieve eternal salvation
rahner's development idea preceded council became insistent after received conciliar formulation
non-christians [their] basic orientation fundamental decision rahner accepted salvific grace god through christ although [they] may never heard christian revelation
writings subject somewhat related views mode grace
language god univocity equivocation section needs additional citations verification
please help improve article adding citations reliable sources
unsourced material may challenged removed
may 2014 like others generation rahner much concerned refuting propositional approach theology typical counter-reformation
alternative proposes statements god referring back original experience god mystery
sense language regarding being analogically predicated mystery inasmuch mystery present same way any determinate possible object consciousness
rahner claim st
thomas aquinas most important influence thought also spoke highly heidegger my teacher elder years heidegger used visit rahner regularly freiburg
noted analogy being greatly diminished rahner's thought
instead claim equivocal predication dominates much rahner's language god
respect similarity other thomist-inspired theologians seen problematic
others however identify rahner's primary influence heidegger neo-thomists early 20 th century especially writings joseph maréchal
criticism jesusism rahner criticized jesusism despite stated respect position
jesusism argues potential theologically dangerous because allows persons perceive jesus example moral values commitments affirmed independently example
christology christology flowchart explaining various christological positions their names task christology make intelligible christian faith jesus nazareth historical person christ center human history final full revelation god humanity—then rahner feels within contemporary mentality sees world evolutionary point view rahner 1978 p
206 person christ should emphasized unique individuality whilst ignoring any possibility combining event christ process human history whole
fact appears there limitations classic christological formula suggested council chalcedon 451
affirms identical son our lord jesus christ
perfect both divinity humanity
[with] two natures without any commingling change division separation
united person
moreover chalcedon formula adopts philosophical concepts such nature hypostatic union no longer used explain interpret religious experiences
thus rahner introduces transcendental christology interprets event person christ relation essential structure human person reflecting essential conditions human experiences conditions transcend any particular kind experience rahner pp
should however first look rahner's basic insights christology within evolutionary view world claims christian faith sees things world come same origin god
means spite their differences there inner similarity commonality among things forms single world
commonality most clearly disclosed human being form unity spirit matter human person spirit matter experienced their real essence their unity
rahner states spirit represents unique mode existence single person person becomes self-conscious oriented towards incomprehensible mystery called god
however free acceptance subject mystery unpredictable disposal subject person genuinely undertake process returning self
conversely matter condition makes human beings estranged themselves towards other objects world makes possible immediate intercommunication other spiritual creatures time space
even there essential difference spirit matter understood essential opposition relationship two intrinsic nature matter develop towards spirit rahner p
kind becoming matter spirit called self-transcendence understood taking place power absolute fullness being rahner p
185 evolutionary view world allows us consider humanity nothing latest stage self-transcendence matter
christian faith god's self-communication according rahner christian faith affirms cosmos reaches final fulfillment receives immediate self-communication own ground spiritual creatures goal high point rahner p
rahner further states god's self-communication world final goal world process self-transcendence makes world already directed towards self-communication acceptance world rahner p
consequence explaining place christ whole process self-transcendence world rahner says process intercommunication spiritual subjects because otherwise there no way retain unity very process
god's self-communication given cosmic subjects freedom accept reject intercommunication other existents
takes place subjects freely accept then forms common history sense addressed men their intercommunication then addressed others call their freedom rahner p
sense rahner claims god's self-communication must permanent beginning beginning guarantee taken place guarantee rightly demand free decision accept divine self-communication rahner p
within scheme saviour refers historical person signifies beginning absolute self-communication god moving towards goal beginning indicates self-communication everyone taken place irrevocably victoriously inaugurated rahner 193
hypostatic union therefore happens intrinsic moment god's self-communication acceptance person met union open spiritual creatures bestowal grace
order fulfilled event should concrete tangibility history rahner p
transcendental christology mediation then examines rahner's transcendental christology may seen presupposes understanding relationship mutual conditioning mediation human existence transcendentally necessary concretely contingently historical rahner p
sort relationship two elements such way transcendental element intrinsic condition historical element historical self while spite being freely posited historical element co-determines existence absolute sense rahner p
transcendental christology experiences man inescapably rahner p
human beings created freely transcend themselves objects world towards incomprehensible mystery called god limitations human situation make human being hope full meaning humanity unity everything world will fulfilled god's self-giving
furthermore god's self-communication human hope should mediated historically because unity transcendentality historicity human existence rahner p
210 human hope looks history salvation god becomes final irreversible end 'eschatological' sense rahner p
point rahner proposes two possibilities human salvation
either fulfillment absolute sense means establishment kingdom god earth historical event within history rahner p
event human salvation god's self-giving love should event human person because god's salvific love effective history person freely accepts love surrenders everything god death death accepted god rahner p
rahner significantly affirms character saviour exemplary absolute given unity world history view point both god world such individual destiny exemplary significance world whole
such man destiny meant absolute saviour rahner p
saviour hypostatic union rahner believes saviour described transcendental christology diverse presented classic christological formulations chalcedon used concept hypostatic union claim jesus christ
accordingly then proceeds articulate meaning hypostatic union
issue how understand meaning human being rahner understands phrase “became man” assuming individual human nature god's own emphasizes self-emptying god becoming kenosis genesis god himself rahner 222
god assumes creating also creates assuming creates emptying himself therefore course himself emptying
creates human reality very fact assumes own
rahner p
god's creating-by-emptying act belongs god's power freedom absolute god's self-giving love expressed scripture rahner p
therefore legitimate rahner assert god subject change himself himself subject change something else
doctrine incarnation teaches us spite immutability truly become something himself time rahner pp
according rahner human beings created oriented towards incomprehensible mystery called god
however human orientation towards mystery fully grasped humans freely choose grasped incomprehensible god assumes human nature god's own reality god's irrevocable offer god's self-communication person freely accepts person united god reaching very point towards humanity moving virtue essence god-man fully fulfilled person jesus nazareth claimed christian faith
sense rahner sees incarnation god unique highest instance actualization essence human reality rahner p
god-man history answer question how find god-man history rahner employs historical approach christology examining history life death jesus nazareth proposes two theses beforehand christian faith requires historical basis 2 considering possibility significant difference person extent person verbalises expresses identity possible both say self-understanding pre-resurrection jesus may contradict historical sense christian understanding person salvific significance state self-understanding may coincide content christological faith rahner p
establish grounds christian faith rahner asserts two points should proven historically credible—first jesus saw himself eschatological prophet absolute definitive saviour second resurrection jesus absolute self-communication god rahner pp
there several historical elements concerning jesus' identity jew radical reformer drastic behaviour solidarity social religious outcasts based belief god essential preaching call conversion gathering disciples hope conversions others acceptance death cross inevitable consequence fidelity mission rahner pp
death resurrection rahner states death resurrection jesus two aspects single event separated rahner p
266 even though resurrection historical event time place like death jesus
scripture offers powerful encounters disciples come experience spirit risen lord jesus among them provoking resurrection faith disciples unique fact rahner p
resurrection return life temporal sphere seal god father upon jesus stood preached pre-easter life
jesus vindicated absolute saviour god rahner p
279 means death entered free obedience surrendering life completely god reaches fulfillment becomes historically tangible us resurrection rahner p
thus resurrection life death jesus understood cause god's salvific will rahner p
284 opens door our salvation saved because man us saved god god thereby made salvific will present world historically really irrevocably rahner p
sense jesus nazareth becomes god-man absolute saviour
non-christian religions rahner's transcendental christology opens another horizon comprises non-christian religions god's universal saving will christ extends non-christians since christ saviour people salvation non-christians comes through christ anonymous christians
just importantly possible say christians learn other religions atheistic humanism because god's grace operative them
presence christ other religions operates through spirit rahner p
316 non-christians respond grace god through unreflexive 'searching christology' searching memory absolute saviour present hearts persons rahner pp
295 318
three specific attitudes become involved absolute love towards one's neighbours 2 attitude readiness death 3 attitude hope future rahner pp
practicing these person acting responding grace god fully manifest life jesus
