theories summary lévi-strauss sought apply structural linguistics ferdinand de saussure anthropology
time family traditionally considered fundamental object analysis seen primarily self-contained[citation needed] unit consisting husband wife their children
nephews cousins aunts uncles grandparents treated secondary
lévi-strauss argued however akin saussure's notion linguistic value families acquire determinate identities through relations another
thus inverted classical view anthropology putting secondary family members first insisting analyzing relations units instead units themselves
own analysis formation identities arise through marriages tribes lévi-strauss noted relation uncle nephew relation brother sister relation father son husband wife c
therefore know c predict just know predict c
goal lévi-strauss's structural anthropology then simplify masses empirical data generalized comprehensible relations units allow predictive laws identified such c
similarly lévi-strauss identified myths type speech through language discovered
work structuralist theory mythology attempted explain how seemingly fantastical arbitrary tales similar across cultures
because believed there authentic version myth rather manifestations same language sought find fundamental units myth namely mytheme
lévi-strauss broke each versions myth down series sentences consisting relation function subject
sentences same function given same number bundled together
these mythemes
lévi-strauss believed discovered examined relations mythemes myth consists juxtaposed binary oppositions
oedipus example consists overrating blood relations underrating blood relations autochthonous origin humans denial their autochthonous origin
influenced hegel lévi-strauss believed human mind thinks fundamentally these binary oppositions their unification thesis antithesis synthesis triad these make meaning possible
furthermore considered job myth sleight hand association irreconcilable binary opposition reconcilable binary opposition creating illusion belief former resolved

may 2013 lévi-strauss's theory set forth structural anthropology 1958
briefly considers culture system symbolic communication investigated methods others used narrowly discussion novels political speeches sports movies
reasoning makes best sense contrasted against background earlier generation's social theory
relationship decades
preference functionalist explanations dominated social sciences turn twentieth century through 1950 s say anthropologists sociologists tried state purpose social act institution
existence thing explained fulfilled function
strong alternative kind analysis historical explanation accounting existence social fact stating how came
idea social function developed two different ways however
english anthropologist alfred reginald radcliffe-brown read admired work french sociologist émile durkheim argued goal anthropological research find collective function such religious creed set rules marriage social order whole
behind approach old idea view civilization developed through series phases primitive modern everywhere same manner
activities given kind society partake same character sort internal logic cause level culture evolve next
view society easily thought organism parts functioning together parts body
contrast influential functionalism bronisław malinowski described satisfaction individual needs person derived participating custom
united states shape anthropology set german-educated franz boas preference historical accounts
approach obvious problems lévi-strauss praises boas facing squarely
historical information seldom available non-literate cultures
anthropologist fills comparisons other cultures forced rely theories no evidential basis whatsoever old notion universal stages development claim cultural resemblances based unrecognized past contact groups
boas came believe no overall pattern social development proven there no single history histories
there three broad choices involved divergence these schools–each decide kind evidence use whether emphasize particulars single culture look patterns underlying societies source any underlying patterns might definition common humanity
social scientists traditions relied cross-cultural studies
necessary supplement information society information others
idea common human nature implicit each approach
critical distinction then remained does social fact exist because functional social order because functional person? uniformities across cultures occur because organizational needs must met everywhere because uniform needs human personality? lévi-strauss choice demands social order
no difficulty bringing out inconsistencies triviality individualistic accounts
malinowski example magic beliefs come being people need feel sense control over events outcome uncertain
trobriand islands found proof claim rites surrounding abortions weaving skirts
same tribes there no magic attached making clay pots even though no certain business weaving
explanation consistent
furthermore these explanations tend used ad hoc superficial way–one postulates trait personality needed
accepted way discussing organizational function didn't work either
different societies might institutions similar many obvious ways yet served different functions
many tribal cultures divide tribe two groups elaborate rules how two groups may interact
exactly may do–trade intermarry–is different different tribes matter criteria distinguishing groups
nor will say dividing-in-two universal need organizations because there lot tribes thrive without
lévi-strauss methods linguistics became model earlier examinations society
analogies usually phonology though also later music mathematics chaos theory cybernetics
really scientific analysis must real simplifying explanatory writes
phonemic analysis reveals features real sense users language recognize respond them
same time phoneme abstraction language–not sound category sound defined way distinguished other categories through rules unique language
entire sound-structure language may generated relatively small number rules
study kinship systems first concerned ideal explanation allowed comprehensive organization data partly ordered other researchers
overall goal find out why family relations differed among various south american cultures
father might great authority over son group example relationship rigidly restricted taboos
another group mother's brother kind relationship son while father's relationship relaxed playful
number partial patterns noted
relations mother father example sort reciprocity those father son–if mother dominant social status formal father example then father usually close relations son
these smaller patterns joined together inconsistent ways
possible way finding master order rate positions kinship system along several dimensions
example father older son father produced son father same sex son matrilineal uncle older same sex produce son
exhaustive collection such observations might cause overall pattern emerge
lévi-strauss kind work considered analytical appearance
results chart far difficult understand original data based arbitrary abstractions empirically fathers older sons researcher declares feature explains their relations
furthermore doesn't explain anything
explanation offers tautological–if age crucial then age explains relationship
does offer possibility inferring origins structure
proper solution puzzle find basic unit kinship explain variations
cluster four roles–brother sister father son
these roles must involved any society incest taboo requiring man obtain wife man outside own hereditary line
[clarification needed] brother may give away sister example whose son might reciprocate next generation allowing own sister marry exogamously
underlying demand continued circulation women keep various clans peacefully related
right wrong solution displays qualities structural thinking
even though lévi-strauss frequently speaks treating culture product axioms corollaries underlie phonemic differences constitute concerned objective data field research
notes logically possible different atom kinship structure exist–sister sister's brother brother's wife daughter–but there no real-world examples relationships derived grouping
trouble view shown australian anthropologist augustus elkin insisted point four class marriage system preferred marriage classificatory mother' s brother's daughter never true
lévi-strauss's atom kinship structure deals consanguineal kin
there big difference two situations kinship structure involving classificatory kin relations allows building system bring together thousands people
lévi-strauss's atom kinship stops working once true mo br da missing
[clarification needed] lévi-strauss also developed concept house society describe those societies domestic unit central social organization descent group lineage
purpose structuralist explanation organize real data simplest effective way
science says either structuralist reductionist
confronting such matters incest taboo facing objective limit human mind accepted far
hypothesize biological imperative underlying far social order concerned taboo effect irreducible fact
social scientist work structures human thought arise
structural explanations tested refuted
mere analytic scheme wishes causal relations existence structuralist sense
lévi-strauss's later works controversial part because impinge subject matter other scholars
believed modern life history founded same categories transformations discovered brazilian back country–the raw cooked honey ashes naked man borrow titles mythologiques
instance compares anthropology musical serialism defends philosophical approach
also pointed out modern view primitive cultures simplistic denying them history
categories myth persist among them because nothing happened–it easy find evidence defeat migration exile repeated displacements kinds known recorded history
instead mythic categories encompassed these changes
argued view human life existing two timelines simultaneously eventful history long cycles set fundamental mythic patterns dominates then perhaps another
respect work resembles fernand braudel historian mediterranean 'la longue durée' cultural outlook forms social organization persisted centuries around sea
right history difficult build up non literate society nevertheless jean guiart's anthropological josé garanger's archeological work central vanuatu bringing fore skeletons former chiefs described local myths thus living persons shows there means ascertaining history groups otherwise deemed a-historical
another issue experience same person tell myth highly charged symbols years later sort chronological history claiming chronic descent line examples loyalty islands new zealand two texts having common each deal topographical detail land-tenure claims descent line see douglas oliver siwai bougainville
lévi-strauss agree these aspects explained inside seminar never touch them own
anthropological data content myths problem
interested formal aspects each story considered result workings collective unconscious each group idea taken linguists cannot proved any way although adamant existence never accept any discussion point
structuralist approach myth lévi-strauss sees basic paradox study myth
hand mythical stories fantastic unpredictable content myth seems completely arbitrary
other hand myths different cultures surprisingly similar hand seem course myth anything likely happen
[…] other hand apparent arbitrariness belied astounding similarity myths collected widely different regions
therefore problem content myth contingent [i
arbitrary] how explain fact myths throughout world similar?208 lévi-strauss proposed universal laws must govern mythical thought resolve seeming paradox producing similar myths different cultures
each myth may seem unique proposed just particular instance universal law human thought
studying myth lévi-strauss tries reduce apparently arbitrary data kind order attain level kind necessity becomes apparent underlying illusions liberty
laurie suggests levi-strauss 'operations embedded within animal myths provide opportunities revolve collective problems classification hierarchy marking lines inside outside law exceptions those belong those not'
according lévi-strauss mythical thought progresses awareness oppositions toward their resolution
224 other words myths consist elements oppose contradict each other other elements mediate resolve those oppositions
example lévi-strauss thinks trickster many native american mythologies acts mediator
lévi-strauss's argument hinges two facts native american trickster trickster contradictory unpredictable personality trickster almost raven coyote
lévi-strauss argues raven coyote mediate opposition life death
relationship agriculture hunting analogous opposition life death agriculture solely concerned producing life least up until harvest time hunting concerned producing death
furthermore relationship herbivores beasts prey analogous relationship agriculture hunting like agriculture herbivores concerned plants like hunting beasts prey concerned catching meat
lévi-strauss points out raven coyote eat carrion therefore halfway herbivores beasts prey like beasts prey eat meat like herbivores don't catch their food
thus argues mediating structure following type224 uniting herbivore traits traits beasts prey raven coyote somewhat reconcile herbivores beasts prey other words mediate opposition herbivores beasts prey
seen opposition ultimately analogous opposition life death
therefore raven coyote ultimately mediate opposition life death
lévi-strauss believes explains why coyote raven contradictory personality appear mythical trickster trickster mediator
since mediating function occupies position halfway two polar terms must retain something duality—namely ambiguous equivocal character
226 because raven coyote reconcile profoundly opposed concepts
life death their own mythical personalities must reflect duality contradiction other words must contradictory tricky personality
theory structure myth helps support lévi-strauss's basic theory human thought
according basic theory universal laws govern areas human thought possible prove instance too apparent arbitrariness mind supposedly spontaneous flow inspiration seemingly uncontrolled inventiveness [are ruled by] laws operating deeper level […] human mind appears determined even realm mythology fortiori must also determined spheres activity
out products culture myths seem most fantastic unpredictable
therefore lévi-strauss claims even mythical thought obeys universal laws then human thought must obey universal laws
savage mind bricoleur engineer lévi-strauss developed comparison bricoleur engineer savage mind
bricoleur origin old french verb bricoler originally referred extraneous movements ball games billiards hunting shooting riding today means do-it-yourself building repairing things tools materials hand puttering tinkering
comparison true craftsman whom lévi-strauss calls engineer bricoleur adept many tasks putting preexisting things together new ways adapting project finite stock materials tools
engineer deals projects their entirety conceiving procuring necessary materials tools suit project
bricoleur approximates savage mind engineer approximates scientific mind
lévi-strauss says universe bricoleur closed often forced make whatever hand whereas universe engineer open able create new tools materials
both live within restrictive reality engineer forced consider preexisting set theoretical practical knowledge technical means similar way bricoleur
criticism lévi-strauss's theory origin trickster criticized number points anthropologists
stanley diamond notes while secular civilized often consider concepts life death polar primitive cultures often see them aspects single condition condition existence
308 diamond remarks lévi-strauss reach such conclusion inductive reasoning simply working backwards evidence priori mediated concepts310 life death reached assumption necessary progression life agriculture herbivorous animals death warfare beasts prey
matter coyote well known hunt addition scavenging raven also known act bird prey contrast lévi-strauss's conception
nor does conception explain why scavenger such bear never appear trickster
diamond further remarks trickster names 'raven' 'coyote' lévi-strauss explains arrived greater economy basis let us say cleverness animals involved their ubiquity elusiveness capacity make mischief their undomesticated reflection certain human traits
311 finally lévi-strauss's analysis does appear capable explaining why representations trickster other areas world make use such animals spider mantis
edmund leach outstanding characteristic writing whether french english difficult understand sociological theories combine baffling complexity overwhelming erudition
readers even suspect being treated confidence trick
sociologist stanislav andreski criticized lévi-strauss's work generally arguing scholarship often sloppy moreover much mystique reputation stemmed threatening people mathematics reference lévi-strauss's use quasi-algebraic equations explain ideas
camille paglia dismissed lévi-strauss overrated commenting yale graduate student ransacked great temple sterling library search paradigms reintegrating literary criticism history found literally nothing lévi-strauss felt scholarly solidity
drawing post-colonial approaches anthropology timothy laurie suggested lévi-strauss speaks vantage point state intent securing knowledge purposes himself often claim salvaging local cultures
