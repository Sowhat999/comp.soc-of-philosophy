[citation needed] contributions literary theory although de man's work 1960 s differs later deconstructive endeavors considerable continuity also discerned
1967 essay criticism crisis argues because literary works understood fictions rather factual accounts exemplify break sign meaning literature means nothing critics resist insight modern critics think demystifying literature fact being demystified
since necessarily occurs form crisis blind takes place within themselves
call anthropology linguistics psychoanalysis nothing literature reappearing like hydra's head very spot suppressed
human mind will go through amazing feats avoid facing 'the nothingness human matters'
de man later observe due resistance acknowledging literature does mean english departments become large organizations service everything except their own subject matter return philology
study literature become art applying psychology politics history philology other disciplines literary text effort make text mean something
among central threads running through de man's work attempt tease out tension rhetoric de man's uses term mean figural language trope meaning seeking moments text linguistic forces tie themselves knot arrests process understanding
de man's earlier essays 1960 s collected blindness insight represent attempt seek these paradoxes texts new criticism move beyond formalism
de man's central topoi blindness these critical readings predicated insight seems instead gained negative movement animates critic's thought unstated principle leads language away asserted stand
very possibility assertion put question
here de man tries undercut notion poetic work unified atemporal icon self-possessed repository meaning freed intentionalist affective fallacies

de man's discussion nietzsche's birth tragedy instance claims genetic[clarification needed] conceptions history appearing text undercut rhetorical strategies nietzsche employs deconstruction does occur statements logical refutation dialectic happens instead hand metalinguistic statements rhetorical nature language other hand rhetorical praxis puts these statements question
de man allegory reading emerges texts subjected such scrutiny reveal tension reading wherein text reveals own assumptions language doing dictates statement undecidability difficulties inherent totalization their own readability limitations textual authority
de man also known readings english german romantic post-romantic poetry philosophy rhetoric romanticism concise deeply ironic essays
specifically noteworthy critical dismantling romantic ideology linguistic assumptions underlie
arguments follow roughly follows
first de man seeks deconstruct privileged claims romanticism symbol over allegory metaphor over metonymy
reading because implication self-identity wholeness inherent romantics' conception metaphor self-identity decomposes also does means overcoming dualism subject object romantic metaphor sought transcend
de man's reading compensate inability romanticism constantly relies allegory attain wholeness established totality symbol
addition essay resistance theory explores task philosophical bases literary theory de man uses example classical trivium grammar rhetoric logic argue use linguistic sciences literary theory criticism
structuralist approach able harmonize logical grammatical dimension literature expense effacing rhetorical elements texts presented greatest interpretive demands
posits resistance theory resistance reading thus resistance theory theory itself
resistance theory constitutes possibility existence theory
taking up example title keats's poem fall hyperion de man draws out irreducible interpretive undecidability bears strong affinities same term derrida's work similarity notion incommensurability developed jean-françois lyotard postmodern condition differend
de man argues recurring motive theoretical readings subsume these decisions under theoretical futile generalizations displaced turn harsh polemics theory
influence legacy de man's influence literary criticism considerable part through numerous vocal disciples
