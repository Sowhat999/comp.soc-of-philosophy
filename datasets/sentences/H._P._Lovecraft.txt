following derleth's death 1971 attorney proclaimed lovecraft's literary material part derleth estate [protected] fullest extent possible
joshi concludes biography h
lovecraft life derleth's claims almost certainly fictitious most lovecraft's works published amateur press most likely now public domain
copyright lovecraft's works inherited surviving heir 1912 will lovecraft's aunt annie gamwell
gamwell herself perished 1941 copyrights then passed her remaining descendants ethel phillips morrish edna lewis
morrish lewis then signed document sometimes referred morrish-lewis gift permitting arkham house republish lovecraft's works retaining copyrights themselves
searches library congress failed find any evidence these copyrights then renewed after 28-year period hence likely these works now public domain
