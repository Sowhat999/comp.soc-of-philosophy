career early 1950 s eccles colleagues performed research win eccles nobel prize
study synapses peripheral nervous system eccles colleagues used stretch reflex model
reflex easily studied because consists two neurons sensory neuron muscle spindle fiber motor neuron
sensory neuron synapses onto motor neuron spinal cord
eccles passed current sensory neuron quadriceps motor neuron innervating quadriceps produced small excitatory postsynaptic potential epsp
passed same current through hamstring opposing muscle quadriceps saw inhibitory postsynaptic potential ipsp quadriceps motor neuron
although single epsp enough fire action potential motor neuron sum several epsps multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto motor neuron cause motor neuron fire thus contracting quadriceps
other hand ipsps subtract sum epsps preventing motor neuron firing
apart these seminal experiments eccles key number important developments neuroscience
until around 1949 eccles believed synaptic transmission primarily electrical rather chemical
although wrong hypothesis arguments led others perform experiments proved chemical synaptic transmission
bernard katz eccles worked together experiments elucidated role acetylcholine neurotransmitter

john carew eccles right czech psychiatrist cyril höschl left 1993 philosophy understanding brain 1973 eccles summarizes philosophy now before discussing brain function detail will beginning give account my philosophical position so-called 'brain-mind problem' you will able relate experimental evidence philosophical position
written length philosophy my book facing reality
6-1 you will able see fully accept recent philosophical achievements sir karl popper concept three worlds
dualist now am trialist! cartesian dualism become unfashionable many people
embrace monism order escape enigma brain-mind interaction perplexing problems
sir karl popper interactionists trialist interactionists! three worlds very easily defined
believe classification fig
6-1 there nothing left out
takes care everything existence our experience
classified other categories enumerated under worlds 2 3
6-1 three worlds world world 2 world 3 physical objects states states consciousness knowledge objective sense
inorganic matter energy cosmos subjective knowledge records intellectual efforts 2
biology structure actions living beings human brains experience perception thinking emotions dispositional intentions memories dreams creative imagination philosophical theological scientific historical literary artistic technological 3

theoretical systems scientific problems critical arguments fig
6-1 world world physical objects states
comprises whole cosmos matter energy biology including human brains artifacts man made coding information example paper ink books material base works art
world total world materialists
recognize nothing else
else fantasy
world 2 world states consciousness subjective knowledge kinds
totality our perceptions comes world
there several levels
agreement polten tend recognize three kinds levels world 2 indicated fig
6-2 may correct think spectrum
6-2 world consciousness outer sense inner sense pure ego light colour sound smell taste pain touch thoughts feelings memories dreams imaginings intentions self - self soul spirit first level outer sense ordinary perceptions provided our sense organs hearing touch sight smell pain
these perceptions world 2 course vision light colour sound music harmony touch qualities vibration range odours tastes
these qualities exist world correspondingly there electromagnetic waves pressure waves atmosphere material objects chemical substances
addition there level inner sense world subtle perceptions
world your emotions your feelings joy sadness fear anger
includes your memory your imaginings planning future
fact there whole range levels described length
subtle experiences human person inner sensory world
private you you reveal linguistic expression gestures levels subtlety
finally core world 2 there self pure ego basis our unity experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime
world 2 our primary reality
our conscious experiences basis our knowledge world thus world secondary reality derivative world
whenever am doing scientific experiment example plan cognitively my thoughts then consciously carry out my plan action experiment
finally look results evaluate them thought
example see traces oscilloscope their photographic records hear signals loudspeaker
various signals recording equipment received my sense organs transmitted my brain my consciousness then appropriately measured compared before begin think significance experimental results
time every action incessantly playing backwards forwards world world 2
world 3? shown fig
6-1 whole world culture
world created man reciprocally made man
my message follow popper unreservedly
whole language here
our means communication our intellectual efforts coded books coded artistic technological treasures museums coded every artifact left man primitive times—this world 3 right up present time
world civilization culture
education means whereby each human being brought relation world 3
manner becomes immersed throughout life participating heritage mankind becoming fully human
world 3 world uniquely relates man
world completely unknown animals
blind world 3
say without any reservations
then first part my story
now come consider way three worlds interact
