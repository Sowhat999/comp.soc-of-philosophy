upon completion theological studies studied sanskrit calcutta under georges dandoy pierre fallon robert antoine members so-called calcutta school jesuit indologists
provoked talk dr s
radhakrishnan meeting indian philosophical congress calcutta 1950 radhakrishnan claimed sankara purely rational philosopher de smet decided show instead srutivadin theologian subordinated reason revealed apauruṣeyā scripture
de smet went doctorate theological method samkaracarya completing gregorian university rome 1953
though never got round publishing thesis became famous among indologists there hundreds copies circulation
returning india march 1954 de smet began teach newly opened centre philosophical studies jesuits de nobili college pune
first assigned courses traditional roman catholic seminaries taught latin also composing guidelines students introduction philosophy + minor logic general metaphysics rational theology subtitled brahma jijnasa special questions metaphysics
also introduced course samkhya began inserting large doses indian philosophy[this quote needs citation] traditional treatises
1968 able open special section indian studies institute now renamed jnana-deepa vidyapeeth jdv
over years 1968-75 composed guidelines indian philosophy cyclostyled notes students beginning ancient indian vedic period going up sankara
meantime right 1954 de smet began attending various meetings indologists indian philosophers indian philosophical congress poona philosophy association bombay philosophy union newly formed indian philosophical association
after initially suspicious reception dr chubb roundly accused excessive missionary zeal kandy session indian philosophical congress 1954 competence self-possession won day soon found himself being invited lecture give courses universities colleges across country
also asked collaborate marathi encyclopedia philosophy marathi tattvajnana mahakosa project pune went become most prolific contributor total 68 articles
besides these 128 entries verbo enciclopedia luso-brasileira de cultura 47 still found latest edition 2 entries telugu encyclopedia
de smet engaged dialogue academics scholars also religious people
frequent invitee sivananda ashram rishikesh lecture sankara other topics also request jesus christianity
visited ramakrishna missions various parts country also aurobindo ashram pondicherry
contacts caitanya vaisnava movement vrindavan
invited sikhs four hundredth anniversary celebrations their founder spoke guru nanak jesus christ

invited lectures hinduism kurisumala ashram founded francis acharya fr francis mahieu vagamon kerala
also engaged willingly christians other denominations teaching their universities seminaries participating their conferences meetings seminars even giving retreats staff students far before word ecumenism became popular catholic church
de smet will remembered two major contributions indological scholarship
first fresh interpretation sankara non-dualist realist rather world-denying illusionist
interpretation hinged discovery rather reinforcement olivier lacombe's discovery fact sankara used analogical predication expounding meaning mahāvākyas great sentences upanisads such tat-tvam-asi satyam jnanam anantam brahma
world neither atyanta sat like brahman nor atyanta asat like son barren woman
instead reality completely ontologically dependent brahman
once notion creation purified anthropomorphism possible speak brahman creator cause world without detriment oneness immutability perfection freedom
second demonstration given original meaning 'person' coined christian theologians speak precisely divine mysteries trinity incarnation supreme brahman nirguna brahman far being impersonal indeed personal highest supreme sense term
richard de smet died belgium 2 march 1997
julius j
lipner professor cambridge student friend de smet's called unsung pioneers interpretation indian thought passing away end era annals indological scholarship india era foreign missionary scholar made india home over many years loved peoples cultures emphathetically studied rich strands religious inheritance sought spirit enlightened appreciation enter dialogue depth
bradley j
malkovsky calls twentieth century's giants hindu-christian dialogue foremost authorities twentieth century hindu theologian samkara
writings early career de smet made option meet requests arising dialogical activity inside india rather produce pieces indological research
also decided give preference requests hindus jains sikhs muslims etc
over those christians
consequence most production consisted occasional pieces wide variety relatively inaccessible indian publications
also resulted hardly being known outside india
even india scattered nature output resulted largely being ignored christian theological circles
