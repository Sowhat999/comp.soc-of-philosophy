particularly interested relations among language thought reality
language primarily means mind ordered influx impressions stimuli
words carry meaning also past experience individual nation through new experience filtered
thus word usually three aspects external form meaning internal form
through internal form objective world subjectivized
many cases internal form rooted myth hence acts bridge language folklore symbols
these ideas constitute framework potebnja's master's thesis o nekotorykh simvolakh v slavianskoi narodnoi poezii symbols slavic folk poetry 1860 expanded edn 1914 monumental work obiasneniia malorusskikh srodnykh narodnykh pesen explanations little russian related folk songs 2 vols 1883 1887
time consciousness word's internal form fades tasks literature restore consciousness
according theory literature hierarchy genres simplest ones proverb riddle fable directly recall renew word's internal form other genres complicated sometimes hardly detectable way through complex system subjective poetry seemingly objective novel images
