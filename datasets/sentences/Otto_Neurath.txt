philosophy science language neurath's later most important works physicalism completely transformed nature logical positivist discussion program unifying sciences
neurath delineates explains points agreement general principles positivist program conceptual bases construction universal system comprehend knowledge furnished various sciences absolute rejection metaphysics sense any propositions translatable verifiable scientific sentences
then rejects positivist treatment language general particular wittgenstein's early fundamental ideas
first neurath rejects isomorphism language reality useless metaphysical speculation call explaining how words sentences represent things external world
instead neurath proposed language reality coincide—that reality consists simply totality previously verified sentences language truth sentence relationship totality already verified sentences
sentence fails concord cohere totality already verified sentences then either should considered false totality's propositions must modified somehow
thus views truth internal coherence linguistic assertions rather anything facts other entities world
moreover criterion verification applied system whole see semantic holism single sentences
such ideas profoundly shaped holistic verificationism willard van orman quine
quine's book word object p
3 f made famous neurath's analogy compares holistic nature language consequently scientific verification construction boat already sea like sailors open sea must reconstruct their ship never able start afresh bottom
beam taken away new must once put there rest ship used support
way using old beams driftwood ship shaped entirely anew gradual reconstruction
stanovich discusses metaphor context memes memeplexes refers metaphor neurathian bootstrap
neurath also rejected notion science should reconstructed terms sense data because perceptual experiences too subjective constitute valid foundation formal reconstruction science
thus phenomenological language most positivists still emphasizing replaced language mathematical physics
allow required objective formulations because based spatio-temporal coordinates
such physicalistic approach sciences facilitate elimination every residual element metaphysics because permit them reduced system assertions relative physical facts
finally neurath suggested since language itself physical system because made up ordered succession sounds symbols capable describing own structure without contradiction
these ideas helped form foundation sort physicalism remains dominant position metaphysics especially philosophy mind
economics economics neurath notable advocacy ideas like in-kind economic accounting place monetary accounting
1920 s also advocated vollsozialisierung complete rather merely partial socialization
thus advocated changes economic system radical those mainstream social-democratic parties germany austria
1920 s neurath debated these matters leading social democratic theoreticians such karl kautsky insisted money necessary socialist economy
while serving government economist during war neurath observed result war in-kind calculus applied often systematically before
war fought ammunition supply food money
goods incommensurable
convinced neurath feasibility economic planning terms amounts goods services without use money
response these ideas ludwig von mises famous essay 1920 economic calculation socialist commonwealth
neurath war economies showed advantages speed decision execution optimal distribution means relative military goals no-nonsense evaluation utilization inventiveness
two disadvantages perceived resulting centralized decision-making reduction productivity loss benefits simple economic exchanges thought reduction productivity mitigated means scientific techniques based analysis work-flows etc
advocated frederick winslow taylor
neurath believed socio-economic theory scientific methods applied together contemporary practice
neurath's view socioeconomic development similar materialist conception history first elaborated classical marxism technology state epistemology come conflict social organization
particular neurath influenced also james george frazer associated rise scientific thinking empiricism / positivism rise socialism both coming conflict older modes epistemology such magical thinking theology allied idealist philosophy latter served reactionary purposes
adherents scientific view world recognize no authority other science reject forms metaphysics
under socialist phase history neurath predicted scientific worldview become dominant mode thought
