mother died dōgen age 7
early training later point dōgen became low-ranking monk mount hiei headquarters tendai school buddhism
according kenzeiki 建撕記 became possessed single question regard tendai doctrine study both exoteric esoteric schools buddhism maintain human beings endowed dharma-nature birth
case why buddhas ages — undoubtedly possession enlightenment — find necessary seek enlightenment engage spiritual practice? question large part prompted tendai concept original enlightenment 本覚 hongaku states human beings enlightened nature consequently any notion achieving enlightenment through practice fundamentally flawed
kenzeiki further states found no answer question mount hiei disillusioned internal politics need social prominence advancement
therefore dōgen left seek answer other buddhist masters
went visit kōin tendai abbot onjō-ji temple 園城寺 asking same question
kōin order find answer might want consider studying chán china
1217 two years after death contemporary zen buddhist myōan eisai dōgen went study kennin-ji temple 建仁寺 under eisai's successor myōzen 明全
travel china 1223 dōgen myōzen undertook dangerous passage across east china sea china study jing-de-si ching-te-ssu 景德寺 monastery eisai once done
china dōgen first went leading chan monasteries zhèjiāng province
time most chan teachers based their training around use gōng-àns japanese kōan
though dōgen assiduously studied kōans became disenchanted heavy emphasis laid upon them wondered why sutras studied
point owing disenchantment dōgen even refused dharma transmission teacher
then 1225 decided visit master named rújìng 如淨 j
nyōjo thirteenth patriarch cáodòng j
sōtō lineage zen buddhism mount tiāntóng 天童山 tiāntóngshān j
tendōzan níngbō
rujing reputed style chan different other masters whom dōgen thus far encountered
later writings dōgen referred rujing old buddha
additionally affectionately described both rujing myōzen senshi 先師? ancient teacher
under rujing dōgen realized liberation body mind upon hearing master say cast off body mind 身心脱落 shēn xīn tuō luò
phrase continue great importance dōgen throughout life found scattered throughout writings as—for example—in famous section genjōkōan 現成公案 study way study self
study self forget self
forget self enlightened things universe
enlightened things universe cast off body mind self well those others
even traces enlightenment wiped out life traceless enlightenment goes forever ever
myōzen died shortly after dōgen arrived mount tiantong
1227 dōgen received dharma transmission inka rujing remarked how finally settled life's quest great matter
return japan dōgen watching moon
hōkyōji monastery fukui prefecture circa 1250
dōgen returned japan 1227 1228 going back stay kennin-ji trained previously
among first actions upon returning write down fukan zazengi 普観坐禅儀 universally recommended instructions zazen short text emphasizing importance giving instructions zazen sitting meditation
however tension soon arose tendai community began taking steps suppress both zen jōdo shinshū new forms buddhism japan
face tension dōgen left tendai dominion kyōto 1230 settling instead abandoned temple today city uji south kyōto
1233 dōgen founded kannon-dōri-in uji small center practice
later expanded temple kōshō-hōrinji temple 興聖法林寺
eihei-ji 1243 hatano yoshishige 波多野義重 offered relocate dōgen's community echizen province far north kyōto
dōgen accepted because ongoing tension tendai community growing competition rinzai-school
followers built comprehensive center practice there calling daibutsu temple daibutsu-ji 大仏寺
while construction work going dōgen live teach yoshimine-dera temple kippō-ji 吉峯寺 located close daibutsu-ji
during stay kippō-ji dōgen fell depression
marked turning point life giving way rigorous critique rinzai zen
criticized dahui zonggao most influential figure song dynasty chán
1246 dōgen renamed daibutsu-ji calling eihei-ji
temple remains two head temples sōtō zen japan today other being sōji-ji
dōgen spent remainder life teaching writing eihei-ji
1247 newly installed shōgun's regent hōjō tokiyori invited dōgen come kamakura teach
dōgen made rather long journey east provide shōgun lay ordination then returned eihei-ji 1248
autumn 1252 dōgen fell ill soon showed no signs recovering
presented robes main apprentice koun ejō 孤雲懐弉 making abbot eihei-ji
death hatano yoshishige's invitation dōgen left kyōto search remedy illness
1253 soon after arriving kyōto dōgen died
shortly before death written death poem fifty-four years lighting up sky
quivering leap smashes billion worlds
hah! entire body looks nothing
living plunge yellow springs
teachings zazen dōgen often stressed critical importance zazen sitting meditation central practice buddhism
considered zazen identical studying zen
pointed out clearly first sentence 1243 instruction manual zazen-gi 坐禪儀 principles zazen studying zen
dōgen taught zazen everyone even laity male female including social classes
referring zazen dōgen most often referring specifically shikantaza roughly translatable nothing precisely sitting kind sitting meditation meditator sits state brightly alert attention free thoughts directed no object attached no particular content
fukanzazengi dōgen zazen quiet room suitable
eat drink moderately
cast aside involvements cease affairs
think good bad
administer pros cons
cease movements conscious mind gauging thoughts views
no designs becoming buddha
zazen nothing whatever sitting lying down
dōgen called zazen practice without thinking hi-shiryo simply aware things beyond thinking not-thinking - active effort think
correct mental attitude zazen according dōgen effortless non-striving because dōgen enlightenment already present
oneness practice-enlightenment primary concept underlying dōgen's zen practice oneness practice-enlightenment 修證一如 shushō-ittō / shushō-ichinyo
dōgen practice zazen experience enlightenment same
point succinctly stressed dōgen fukan zazengi first text composed upon return japan china practice way singleheartedly itself enlightenment
there no gap practice enlightenment zazen daily life
earlier same text basis identity explained detail zazen step-by-step meditation
rather simply easy pleasant practice buddha realization buddha's wisdom
truth appears there being no delusion
you understand you completely free like dragon obtained water tiger reclines mountain
supreme law will then appear itself you will free weariness confusion
oneness practice-enlightenment also point stressed bendōwa 弁道話 talk endeavor path 1231 thinking practice enlightenment no view outside way
buddha-dharma [i
buddhism] practice enlightenment same
because practice enlightenment beginner's wholehearted practice way exactly totality original enlightenment
reason conveying essential attitude practice taught wait enlightenment outside practice
buddha-nature dōgen buddha-nature busshō 佛性 nature reality being
shōbōgenzō dōgen writes whole-being buddha-nature even inanimate things grass trees etc
expression buddha-nature
rejected any view saw buddha-nature permanent substantial inner self ground
dōgen held buddha-nature vast emptiness world becoming impermanence itself buddha-nature
according dōgen therefore very impermanency grass tree thicket forest buddha nature
very impermanency men things body mind buddha nature
nature lands mountains rivers impermanent because buddha nature
supreme complete enlightenment because impermanent buddha nature
time-being dōgen's conception time-being uji 有時 essential element metaphysics shōbōgenzō
according traditional interpretation uji here means time itself being being time
uji changing dynamic activities exist flow becoming beings entire world time
view developed scholars such steven heine joan stambaugh others served motivation compare dōgen's work martin heidegger
recently however rein raud argued view correct dōgen asserts existence momentary showing such reading make quite few rather cryptic passages shōbōgenzō quite lucid
perfect expression another essential element dōgen's 'performative' metaphysics conception perfect expression dōtoku 道得
while radically critical view language soteriologically inefficient positively harmful zen buddhism famous argued 'within framework rational theory language against obscurantist interpretation zen time again invokes experience
dōgen distinguishes two types language monji 文字 first after ernst cassirer discursive type constantly structures our experiences and—more fundamentally—in fact produces world experience first place dōtoku 道得 second presentative type takes holistic stance establishes totality significations through texture relations
döll points out second type müller holds allows positive view language even radically skeptical perspective dōgen’s brand zen buddhism
critique rinzai dōgen sometimes critical rinzai school their formulaic intellectual koan practice such practice shiryoken four discernments well their disregard sutras recently great sung dynasty china there many call themselves zen masters
know length breadth buddha-dharma
heard seen little
memorize two three sayings lin chi yun men think whole way buddha-dharma
dharma buddha condensed two three sayings lin chi yun men transmitted present day
hardly say lin chi yun men venerable ones buddha-dharma
dōgen also very critical japanese daruma school dainichi nonin
virtues dogen's perspective virtue discussed shōbōgenzō text something practiced inwardly will manifest itself outside
other words virtue something both internal external sense practice internal good dispositions also expression these good dispositions
writings universally recommended instructions zazen 普勧坐禅儀 fukan zazengi while customary buddhist works written chinese dōgen often japanese conveying essence thought style once concise compelling inspiring
master stylist dōgen noted prose also poetry japanese waka style various chinese styles
dōgen's use language unconventional any measure
according dōgen scholar steven heine dogen's poetic philosophical works characterized continual effort express inexpressible perfecting imperfectable speech through creative use wordplay neologism lyricism well recasting traditional expressions
shōbōgenzō dōgen's masterpiece shōbōgenzō talks writings—collected together ninety-five fascicles
topics range monastic practice equality women men philosophy language being time
work own life dōgen emphasized absolute primacy shikantaza inseparability practice enlightenment
shinji shōbōgenzō dōgen also compiled collection 301 koans chinese without commentaries added
often called shinji shōbōgenzō shinjioriginal true characters shōbōgenzō variously translated right-dharma-eye treasury treasury eye true dharma
collection also known shōbōgenzō sanbyakusoku three hundred verse shōbōgenzō mana shōbōgenzō mana alternative reading shinji
exact date book written dispute nishijima believes dogen may well begun compiling koan collection before trip china
although these stories commonly referred kōans dōgen referred them kosoku ancestral criteria innen circumstances causes results story
word kōan dogen meant absolute reality universal dharma
eihei kōroku shōbōgenzō zuimonki lectures dōgen gave monks monastery eihei-ji compiled under title eihei kōroku also known dōgen oshō kōroku extensive record teacher dōgen’s sayings ten volumes

work discovered among dōgen’s papers ejō 1253 just three months after dōgen’s death
other writings other notable writings dōgen fukan-zazengi general advice principles zazen volume probably written immediately after dōgen’s return china 1227 eihei shoso gakudō-yōinshū advice studying way volume probably written 1234 tenzo kyōkun instructions chief cook volume written 1237 benōhō rules practice way volume written 1244 1246
shushō-gi concept oneness practice-enlightenment considered fundamental dōgen's variety zen — consequently sōtō school whole — formed basis work shushō-gi 修證儀 compiled 1890 takiya takushū 滝谷卓洲 eihei-ji azegami baisen 畔上楳仙 sōji-ji introductory prescriptive abstract dōgen's massive work shōbōgenzō treasury eye true dharma
lineage though dogen emphasised importance correct transmission buddha dharma guaranteed line transmission shakyamuni own transmission became problematic third generation

gikai introduced esoteric elements practice
opposition arose 1272 ejō resumed position abbot
following ejō's death 1280 gikai became abbot again strengthened support military magical practices

succeeded gien first trained daruma-school nōnin
supporters designated third abbot rejecting legitimacy gien

jakuen student rujing traced lineage directly back zen song period established hōkyō-ji strict style zen practised
students played role conflict giin gikai
