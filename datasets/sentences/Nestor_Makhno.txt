march 1918 makhno's forces allied anarchist guerrilla groups won victories against german austrian ukrainian nationalist army symon petlura forces units white army capturing lot german austro-hungarian arms
these victories over much larger enemy forces established makhno's reputation military tactician became known batko ‘father’ admirers
point emphasis military campaigns makhno adopted previous year shifted political concerns
first congress confederation anarchists groups under name nabat alarm drum issued five main principles rejection political parties rejection forms dictatorships including dictatorship proletariat viewed makhnovists many anarchists day term synonymous dictatorship bolshevik communist party negation any concept central state rejection so-called transitional period necessitating temporary dictatorship proletariat self-management workers through free local workers' councils soviets
while bolsheviks argued their concept dictatorship proletariat meant precisely rule workers' councils makhnovist platform opposed temporary bolshevik measure party dictatorship
nabat no means puppet mahkno supporters time time criticizing black army conduct war
1918 after recruiting large numbers ukrainian peasants well numbers jews anarchists naletchki recruits arriving other countries makhno formed revolutionary insurrectionary army ukraine otherwise known anarchist black army
formation black army consisted 15000 armed troops including infantry cavalry both regular irregular brigades artillery detachments incorporated each regiment
november 1918 june 1919 using black army secure hold power makhnovists attempted create anarchist society ukraine administered local level autonomous peasants' workers' councils
new relationships values generated new social paradigm led makhnovists formalize policy free communities highest form social justice
education organized francisco ferrer's principles economy based upon free exchange rural urban communities crop cattle manufactured products according science proposed peter kropotkin
[citation needed] makhno called bolsheviks dictators opposed cheka [secret police]
similar compulsory authoritative disciplinary institutions called [f]reedom speech press assembly unions like
bolsheviks turn accused makhnovists imposing formal government over area controlled also makhnovists used forced conscription committed summary executions two military counter-intelligence forces kontrrazvedka punitive functions transferred 1920 kommissiya protivmakhnovskikh del commission anti-makhnovist activities
bolsheviks claimed impossible small agricultural society organize anarchist society quickly
however eastern ukraine large amount coal mines most industrialised parts russian empire
relations makhnovists mennonite colonists revolutionary peasant leader makhno called colourful personality career legendary
however view german mennonite communities ukraine considered instigator military ravages against innocent farmers inhuman monster whose path literally drenched blood
consistently referred terrorist bandit mennonite literature
age makhno began working ox drover janzen estate silberfeld
here began develop hatred ruling classes
memoirs writes time began experience anger envy even hatred towards landowner [janzen] especially towards children those young slackers often strolled past me sleek healthy well-dressed well-groomed scented while filthy dressed rags barefoot reeked manure cleaning calves' barn
makhno also worked mennonite owned kroeger plant gulyai-polye
throughout civil war mahkno troops raided many german mennonite colonies estates katerynoslav oblast
larger rural landholdings mennonites prominent targets due their wealth proximity gulyai-polye
schönfeld colony located adjacent huliaipole area unique consisted predominantly mennonite estate settlements across expansive area
mennonite colonies targeted makhno because owners prosperous farms estates considered kulaks wealthy farmers exploited labour surrounding mostly ukrainian peasantry
ukrainians traditionally hired wealthy mennonites house servants farmhands
while prohibited their religion serving tsar's army many mennonites assisted russian war effort performing national service non-fighting roles notably forestry medical units
mennonites' germanic background also served inflame negative sentiment during period revolution many makhnovists families suffered under german-austro-hungarian occupation 1918
makhno's own brother emelian disabled war veteran murdered mother's home burned ground occupation
mennonites themselves having stripped their wealth property during revolution embraced occupation promised reestablish them landowners
mennonites accompanied punitive detachments against peasantry greatly contributed growing bitterness mennonites ukrainians
october 1918 austro-hungarian forces german colonists burned down pro-makhnovist village bolshe-mikholaivka murdered many inhabitants
makhno responded sustained campaign retribution against german/mennonite colonies estates
same time makhno voiced opposition indiscriminate slaughter colonists established ground rules occupying colonies
throughout 1918 total 96 mennonites killed schönfeld-brasol area
winter 1918–1919 most residents schönfeld colony fled relative safety molotschna colony
while under german occupation mennonites encouraged form self-defence selbstschutz units
mennonite youth trained armed under supervision german officers
breaking nearly four centuries pacifism tacit approval selbstschutz given mennonite leadership lichtenau conference [june 30- july 2 1918]
intended exclusively defence colony arrival general denikin's white volunteer army selbstschutz gradually drawn offensive operations against makhno
later civil war mennonites also formed ethnic battalions within white army
selbstschutz initially successful protecting their communities against makhno's partisans overwhelmed once anarchists aligned themselves red army entered ukraine february 1919
mennonites molotschna colony under joint makhnovist-red occupation until whites broke through southern front may 1919
following makhno's devastating attack denikin's rearguard september–october 1919 mennonite colonies found themselves once under makhnovist occupation
year 1919 saw greatest number mennonites killed 827 67% mennonite civil war deaths
great majority these occurred october december
during period major massacres occurred eichenfeld yazykovo blumenort molotschna steinfeld ebenfeld borozenko münsterberg zagradovka while under administrative control makhnovists
chortitza colony also suffered great degree death robbery
despite ongoing debate investigation makhno's personal culpability massacres there currently no evidence present sanctioned these actions
according research peter letkemann 3336 russian mennonites three percent their total population died 1914 1923
ninety-six percent these deaths occurred ukraine

however these claims never proven
anarchist paul avrich writes maknno's alleged anti-semitism
charges jew-baiting anti-jewish pogroms come every quarter left right center
without exception however based hearsay rumor intentional slander remain undocumented unproved
avrich notes considerable number jews took part makhnovist anarchist movement

according peter kenez “he self-educated man committed teachings bakunin kropotkin fairly described anti-semite
makhno jewish comrades friends like symon petliura issued proclamation forbidding pogroms
kenez goes claim no evidence reason source anarchist leader impose discipline soldiers
name ‘class struggle’ troops particular enthusiasm robbed jews whatever
spirit standards behaviour makhno promoted troops called war against rich bourgeoisie nationalities russian ukrainian jewish well explicit order beat rob peaceful jews
