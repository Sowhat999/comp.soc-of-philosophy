todorov defines fantastic being any event happens our world seems supernatural
upon occurrence event must decide event illusion whether real actually taken place
todorov uses alvaro jacques cazotte's le diable amoureux example fantastic event
alvaro must decide whether woman love truly woman she devil

fantastic uncanny event occurs actually illusion sort
laws reality remain intact also provide rational explanation fantastic event
todorov gives examples dreams drugs illusions senses madness etc
things explain fantastic/supernatural event
fantastic marvelous supernatural event occurs actually taken place therefore laws reality changed explain event
implied reader cannot opt other possibility text purely fantastic
