austin march 1911 february 1960 british philosopher language leading proponent ordinary language philosophy perhaps best known developing theory speech acts
prior austin attention linguistic analytic philosophers directed almost exclusively statements assertions propositions — linguistic acts least theory truth-value
led problems analyzing certain types statements example determining truth conditions such statements promise so-and-so
austin pointed out use language things well assert things utterance statement like promise so-and-so best understood doing something — making promise — rather making assertion anything

austin educated shrewsbury school 1924 earning scholarship classics went study classics balliol college oxford 1929
1933 received first literae humaniores classics philosophy well gaisford prize greek prose first class honours finals
literae humaniores introduced serious philosophy gave lifelong interest aristotle
undertook first teaching position 1935 fellow tutor magdalen college oxford
austin's early interests included aristotle kant leibniz plato especially theaetetus
contemporary influences included especially g
moore john cook wilson h
contemporary influences shaped their views general philosophical questions basis careful attention specific judgements make
took our specific judgements secure general judgements
it's plausible aspects austin's distinctive approach philosophical questions derived engagement last three
during world war ii austin served british intelligence corps
anybody responsible life-saving accuracy d-day intelligence reported warnock 1963 9
austin left army rank lieutenant colonel honored intelligence work obe officer order british empire french croix de guerre u

after war austin became white's professor moral philosophy oxford
began holding famous austin's saturday mornings students colleagues discuss language usages sometimes books language over tea crumpets published little
austin visited harvard berkeley mid-fifties 1955 delivering william james lectures harvard become how things words offering seminar excuses whose material find way plea excuses

president aristotelian society 1956 1957
austin died age 48 lung cancer
time developing semantic theory based sound symbolism using english gl-words data
[citation needed] work how things words how things words perhaps austin's most influential work
contrast positivist view argues sentences truth-values form small part range utterances
after introducing several kinds sentences asserts neither true nor false turns particular these kinds sentences calls performative utterances just performatives
these characterises two features again though may take form typical indicative sentence performative sentences used describe constate thus true false no truth-value
second utter these sentences appropriate circumstances just say something rather perform certain kind action
goes say something goes wrong connection performative utterance puts infelicitous unhappy rather false
action performed 'performative utterance' issued belongs austin later calls speech-act particularly kind action austin mind subsequently terms illocutionary act
example you say name ship queen elizabeth circumstances appropriate certain ways then you will done something special namely you will performed act naming ship
other examples include take man my lawfully wedded husband used course marriage ceremony bequeath watch my brother occurring will
three cases sentence being used describe state 'doing' being used actually 'do'
after numerous attempts find characteristics performatives after having met many difficulties austin makes calls fresh start considers generally senses say something may something saying something something
example john smith turns sue snub says ‘is jeff’s shirt red?’ sue replies ‘yes’
john produced series bodily movements result production certain sound
austin called such performance phonetic act called act phone
john’s utterance also conforms lexical grammatical conventions english—that john produced english sentence
austin called phatic act labels such utterances phemes
john also referred jeff’s shirt colour red
use pheme less definite sense reference utter rheme perform rhetic act
note rhemes sub-class phemes turn sub-class phones
cannot perform rheme without also performing pheme phone
performance these three acts performance locution—it act saying something
john therefore performed locutionary act
also done least two other things
asked question elicited answer sue
asking question example austin called illocutionary act
other examples making assertion giving order promising something
perform illocutionary act use locution certain force
act performed saying something contrast locution act saying something
eliciting answer example austin calls perlocutionary act act performed saying something
notice successfully performs perlocution also succeeds performing both illocution locution
theory speech acts attention especially focused illocutionary act much less locutionary perlocutionary act rarely subdivision locution phone pheme rheme
how things words based lectures given oxford 1951 1954 then harvard 1955
performative utterance according j
austin performative utterance refers truth-evaluable action performing doing certain action
example people say promise generating action making promise
case without any flaw promise flawlessly fulfilled performative utterance happy use j
austin’s word felicitous other hand fails she promised unhappy infelicitous
notice performative utterance truth-evaluable means nothing judged based truth falsity
there four types performatives according austin explicit implicit primitive inexplicit
how things words edited j
urmson marina sbisa records austin's lectures topic
book austin offers examples each type performative mentioned above
explicit performatives mentioned apologize criticize page 83 explicit receivers make sense someone ask does really mean that?
inexplicit performatives opposite receiver will understandable doubts
primary performatives example austin gave shall there
compared explicit performatives there uncertainty implicit performatives
people might ask she promising there primary performatives however uncertainty strong enough inexplicit performatives
most examples given explicit because easy identify observe identifying other performatives requires comparison contrast explicit performatives

states perceptual variation attributed physical causes does involve figurative disconnect sense reference due unreasonable separation parts perceived object
central argument shows there no kind thing ‘perceive’ many different kinds number being reducible scientific investigation philosophy austin 1962 4
austin argues ayer fails understand proper function such words illusion delusion hallucination looks appears seems uses them instead special way
invented philosophers
according austin normally these words allow us express reservations our commitment truth saying introduction sense-data adds nothing our understanding ability talk see
example austin examines word ‘real’ contrasts ordinary meanings word based everyday language ways used sense-data theorists
order determine meaning ‘real’ consider case case ways contexts used
observing substantive-hungry word sometimes ii adjuster-word well iii dimension-word iv word whose negative use wears trousers austin highlights it’s complexities
doing according austin avoid introducing false dichotomies
philosophical papers austin's papers collected published posthumously philosophical papers j
urmson geoffrey warnock
book originally contained ten papers two being added second edition third
paper excuses massive impact criminal law theory
chapters 3 study how word may different related senses
chapters 2 4 discuss nature knowledge focusing performative utterance
chapters 5 6 study correspondence theory statement true corresponds fact
chapters 6 10 concern doctrine speech acts
chapters 9 12 reflect problems language encounters discussing actions considering cases excuses accusations freedom
there priori concepts? early paper contains broad criticism idealism
question set dealing existence priori concepts treated indirectly dismissing concept concept underpins
first part paper takes form reply argument existence universals observing use words such grey circular use single term each case follows there must something named such terms—a universal
furthermore since each case grey circular different follows universals themselves cannot sensed
austin carefully dismantles argument process other transcendental arguments
points out first universals something stumble across defined their relation particulars
continues pointing out observation use grey circular names things simply does follow there something named
process dismisses notion words essentially proper names asking
why 'one identical' word used must there 'one identical object' present denotes
second part article generalizes argument against universals address concepts whole
points out facile treat concepts article property
such questions possess such-and-such concept how come possess such-and-such concept meaningless because concepts sort thing possesses
final part paper austin further extends discussion relations presenting series arguments reject idea there thing relation
argument likely follows conjecture colleague s
tezlaf questioned makes
meaning word meaning word polemic against doing philosophy attempting pin down meaning words used arguing 'there no simple handy appendage word called meaning word x'
austin warns us take care removing words their ordinary usage giving numerous examples how lead error
other minds other minds most highly acclaimed pieces austin criticizes method philosophers used since descartes analyze verify statements form person s feels x
method works following three assumptions know intuit directly feel feels
2 impossible
3 may possible find strong evidence belief our impressions
although austin agrees 2 quipping should pretty predicament found false 3 therefore unnecessary
background assumption austin claims say know x later find out x false know
austin believes consistent way actually use language
claims position normally say know x x should turn out false speechless rather self-corrective
gives argument suggesting believing knowing intending promising— knowing promising speech-act versions believing intending respectively
plea excuses plea excuses both demonstration example defense methods ordinary language philosophy proceeds conviction
our common stock words embodies distinctions men found worth drawing connections found worth marking lifetime many generations these surely likely numerous sound since stood up long test survival fittest subtle least ordinary reasonable practical matters any you likely think up our armchair afternoon—the most favourite alternative method
example such distinction austin describes footnote phrases mistake accident
although their uses similar austin argues right examples see distinction exists other phrase appropriate
austin proposes curious philosophical tools
instance uses sort word game developing understanding key concept
involves taking up dictionary finding selection terms relating key concept then looking up each words explanation their meaning
process iterated until list words begins repeat closing family circle words relating key concept
austin wittgenstein austin occupies place philosophy language alongside cantabrigian wittgenstein austin's fellow oxonian gilbert ryle staunchly advocating examination way words ordinarily used order elucidate meaning means avoid philosophical confusions
unlike many ordinary language philosophers however austin disavowed any overt indebtedness wittgenstein's later philosophy
