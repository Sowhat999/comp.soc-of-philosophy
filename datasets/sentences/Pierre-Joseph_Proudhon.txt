property theft referring landowner capitalist believed stole profits laborers
proudhon capitalist's employee subordinated exploited permanent condition obedience
asserting property freedom referring product individual's labor peasant artisan's home tools trade income received selling goods
proudhon legitimate source property labor
produces one's property anything beyond
advocated worker self-management opposed private ownership means production

under universal association ownership land instruments labour social ownership

proudhon called himself socialist opposed state ownership capital goods favour ownership workers themselves associations
makes first theorists libertarian socialism
proudhon main influences theory workers' self-management autogestion late 19 th 20 th century
proudhon strenuously rejected ownership products labor society state arguing property? while property product
does carry property means production right product exclusive
right means common applied land land [
common thing workplaces accumulated capital being social property no exclusive proprietor
argued while society owned means production land users control run them under supervision society organising regulating societies order regulate market
proudhon's grave paris use-ownership called possession economic system mutualism
proudhon many arguments against entitlement land capital including reasons based morality economics politics individual liberty
such argument enabled profit turn led social instability war creating cycles debt eventually overcame capacity labor pay them off
another produced despotism turned workers wage workers subject authority boss
property? proudhon property acting exclusion encroachment while population increasing life-principle definitive cause revolutions
religious wars wars conquest stopped short extermination races accidental disturbances soon repaired mathematical progression life nations
downfall death societies due power accumulation possessed property
towards end life proudhon modified earlier views
principle federation 1863 modified earlier anti-state position arguing balancing authority liberty put forward decentralised theory federal government
also defined anarchy differently government each himself meant political functions reduced industrial functions social order arises nothing transactions exchanges
work also saw call economic system agro-industrial federation arguing provide specific federal arrangements protect citizens federated states capitalist financial feudalism both within them outside stop re-introduction wage labour
because political right requires buttressed economic right
posthumously published theory property argued property power act counterweight state
hence proudhon retain idea property theft same time offer new definition liberty
there constant possibility abuse exploitation spells theft
same time property spontaneous creation society bulwark against ever-encroaching power state
continued oppose both capitalist state property
theory property maintains now 1840 categorically rejected notion property
both group individual then states new theory property property greatest revolutionary force exists unequaled capacity setting itself against authority
principal function private property within political system will act counterweight power state doing insure liberty individual
however continued oppose concentrations wealth property arguing small-scale property ownership associated peasants artisans
still opposed private property land cannot accept regarding land work put gives right ownership worked
addition still believed property should equally distributed limited size actually used individuals families workers associations
supported right inheritance defended foundations family society
however refused extend beyond personal possessions arguing [u]nder law association transmission wealth does apply instruments labour
consequence opposition profit wage labour worker exploitation ownership land capital well state property proudhon rejected both capitalism communism
adopted term mutualism brand anarchism involved control means production workers
vision self-employed artisans peasants cooperatives trade their products market
proudhon factories other large workplaces run labor associations operating directly democratic principles
state abolished instead society organized federation free communes commune local municipality french
1863 proudhon my economic ideas developed over twenty-five years summed up words agricultural-industrial federation
my political ideas boil down similar formula political federation decentralization
proudhon opposed charging interest rent seek abolish them law protest criticized
complex institutions property foundation stone never meant forbid suppress sovereign decree ground rent interest capital
think these manifestations human activity should remain free voluntary ask them no modifications restrictions suppressions other those result naturally necessity universalization principle reciprocity propose
