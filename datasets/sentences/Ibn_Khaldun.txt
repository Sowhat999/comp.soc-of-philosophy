ibn khaldun economic growth ibn khaldūn left behind few works other history world kitāb al-ʻibar
significantly such writings alluded autobiography suggesting perhaps ibn khaldūn saw himself first foremost historian wanted known above author kitāb al-ʻibar
other sources know several other works primarily composed during time spent north africa al-andalus
first book lubābu l-muhassal commentary islamic theology fakhr al-din al-razi written age 19 under supervision teacher al-ābilī tunis
work sufism sifā'u l-sā'il composed around 1373 fes morocco
whilst court muhammed v sultan granada ibn khaldūn composed work logic ʻallaqa li-s-sulṭān
kitāb al-ʻibār full title kitāb al-ʻibar wa-dīwān al-mubtadaʼ wa-l-khabar fī taʼrīkh al-ʻarab wa-l-barbar wa-man ʻāṣarahum min dhawī ash-shaʼn al-akbār book lessons record beginnings events history arabs berbers their powerful contemporaries ibn khaldūn's main work originally conceived history berbers
later focus widened final form including own methodology anthropology represent so-called universal history
divided seven books first muqaddimah considered separate work
books two five cover history mankind up time ibn khaldūn
books six seven cover history berber peoples maghreb remain invaluable present-day historians based ibn khaldūn's personal knowledge berbers
businesses owned responsible organized merchants shall eventually surpass those owned wealthy rulers
ibn khaldun economic growth opposing ideals platonism concerning discipline sociology conceived theory social conflict
developed dichotomy sedentary life versus nomadic life well concept generation inevitable loss power occurs desert warriors conquer city
following contemporary arab scholar sati' al-husri muqaddimah may read sociological work six books general sociology
topics dealt work include politics urban life economics knowledge
work based around ibn khaldun's central concept ''aṣabiyyah translated social cohesion group solidarity tribalism
social cohesion arises spontaneously tribes other small kinship groups intensified enlarged religious ideology
ibn khaldun's analysis looks how cohesion carries groups power contains within itself seeds psychological sociological economic political group's downfall replaced new group dynasty empire bound stronger least younger vigorous cohesion
ibn khaldun cited racist theories rise fall empires no racial component reading work claimed result mistranslations
should then look world creation
started out minerals progressed ingenious gradual manner plants animals
last stage minerals connected first stage plants such herbs seedless plants
last stage plants such palms vines connected first stage animals such snails shellfish power touch
word connection regard these created things means last stage each group fully prepared become first stage next group
animal world then widens species become numerous gradual process creation finally leads man able think reflect
higher stage man reached world monkeys both sagacity perception found reached stage actual reflection thinking
point come first stage man after world monkeys
far our physical observation extends
ibn khaldun evolution perhaps most frequently cited observation drawn ibn khaldūn's work notion society becomes great civilization presumably dominant culture region high point followed period decay
means next cohesive group conquers diminished civilization comparison group barbarians
once barbarians solidify their control over conquered society however become attracted refined aspects such literacy arts either assimilate appropriate such cultural practices
then eventually former barbarians will conquered new set barbarians will repeat process
contemporary readers khaldun read early business cycle theory though set historical circumstances mature islamic empire
ibn khaldun outlines early possibly even earliest example political economy
describes economy being composed value-adding processes labour skill added techniques crafts product sold higher value
also made distinction profit sustenance modern political economy terms surplus required reproduction classes respectively
also calls creation science explain society goes outline these ideas major work muqaddimah
ibn khaldun also emphasized islamic monetary system currency money should intrinsic value
should made up gold silver
gold dinar silver dirham
also emphasized weight purity these coins should strictly followed
weight dinar should mithqal
equal weight 72 grains barley equals almost 4
25 grams weight 7 dinar should equal weight 10 dirhams equal 7/10 mithqal 2
975 grams
according these coins must used laws concerning charity tax zakat marriage fees fixed legal fines other things
dirham dinar differ value weight different regions cities provinces
religious law occasion refer these coins mentioned them connection many laws concerning charity tax marriage fees fixed legal fines other things
therefore religious law must own dirham dinar specific value given them religious law itself agreeing intention religious law
these coins then ones laws refer
different non-legal coins
ibn khaldun islamic monetary economics revelation undertook mention them attached many judgements them example zakat marriage hudud etc
therefore within revelation reality specific measure assessment zakat etc
upon judgements may based rather non-shari'i other coins
know there consensus since beginning islam age companions followers dirham shari'ah ten weigh seven mithqals weight dinar gold
weight mithqal gold seventy-two grains barley dirham seven-tenths fifty two-fifths grains
these measurements firmly established consensus ibn khaldun gold dinar silver dirham money legacy possible non-symmetric laffer curve maximum revenue point around 70% tax rate based how far slippery slope? laffer himself does claim invented concept attributing 14 th-century muslim scholar ibn khaldun john maynard keynes
