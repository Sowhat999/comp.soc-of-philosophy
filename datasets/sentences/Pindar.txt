pindar twenty years old 498 bc commissioned ruling family thessaly compose first victory ode pythian 10
studied art lyric poetry athens tutor lasos hermione also received helpful criticism corinna
early-to-middle years pindar's career coincided persian invasions greece reigns darius xerxes
during invasion 480/79 bc pindar almost forty years old thebes occupied xerxes' general mardonius many theban aristocrats subsequently perished battle plataea
possible pindar spent much time aegina
choice residence during earlier invasion 490 bc known able attend pythian games year first met sicilian prince thrasybulus nephew theron acragas
thrasybulus driven winning chariot pindar form lasting friendship paving way subsequent visit sicily
middle age pindar seems used odes advance friends' personal interests
462 bc composed two odes honour arcesilas king cyrene pythians 4 5 pleading return exile friend demophilus
latter ode pindar proudly mentions own ancestry shared king aegeid descendent aegeus legendary king athens
clan influential many parts greek world having intermarried ruling families thebes lacedaemonia cities claimed lacedaemonian descent such cyrene thera
historian herodotus considered clan important enough deserve mention histories iv
membership clan possibly contributed pindar's success poet informed political views marked conservative preference oligarchic governments doric kind
pindar might actually claim aegeid since 'i' statements necessarily refer himself
aegeid clan however branch thebes reference my ancestors pythian 5 spoken behalf both arcesilas himself may used ambivalence establish personal link patrons
possibly theban proxenos consul aegina and/or molossia indicated another odes nemean 7 glorifies neoptolemus national hero aegina molossia
according tradition neoptolemus died disgracefully fight priests temple delphi over their share sacrificial meat
pindar diplomatically glosses over concludes mysteriously earnest protestation innocence shall my heart never admit words none redeem dishonoured neoptolemus
possibly responding anger among aeginetans and/or molossians over portrayal neoptolemus earlier poem paean 6 commissioned priests delphi depicted hero's death traditional terms divine retribution past crimes
doubt biographical interpretation nemean 7 since largely based marginal comments scholiasts pindaric scholiasts often unreliable
fact pindar gave different versions myth may simply reflect needs different genres does necessarily indicate personal dilemma
nemean 7 fact most controversial obscure pindar's victory odes scholars ancient modern ingenious imaginative their attempts explain far no agreed success
first pythian ode composed 470 bc honour sicilian tyrant hieron pindar celebrated series victories greeks against foreign invaders athenian spartan-led victories against persia salamis plataea victories western greeks led theron acragas hieron against carthaginians etruscans battles himera cumae
such celebrations appreciated fellow thebans sided persians incurred many losses privations result their defeat
praise athens such epithets bulwark hellas fragment 76 city noble name sunlit splendour nemean 5 induced authorities thebes fine 5000 drachmae athenians responded gift 10000 drachmae
according another account athenians even made their proxenus consul thebes
association fabulously rich hieron another source annoyance home
probably response theban sensitivities over issue denounced rule tyrants
rulers like hieron ode composed shortly after visit hieron's sumptuous court 476–75 bc pythian
pindar's actual phrasing pythian deplore lot tyrants though traditionally interpreted apology dealings sicilian tyrants like hieron alternative date ode led scholars conclude fact covert reference tyrannical behaviour athenians although interpretation ruled out accept earlier note covert references
according yet another interpretation pindar simply delivering formulaic warning successful athlete avoid hubris
highly unlikely pindar ever acted athenians their proxenus consul thebes
lyric verse conventionally accompanied music dance pindar himself music choreographed dances victory odes
sometimes trained performers home thebes sometimes trained them venue performed
commissions took parts greek world panhellenic festivals mainland greece olympia delphi corinth nemea westwards sicily eastwards seaboard asia minor north macedonia abdera paean 2 south cyrene african coast
other poets same venues vied favours patrons
poetry sometimes reflects rivalry
example olympian 2 pythian 2 composed honour sicilian tyrants theron hieron following visit their courts 476–75 bc refer respectively ravens ape apparently signifying rivals engaged campaign smears against possibly poets simonides nephew bacchylides
pindar's original treatment narrative myth often relating events reverse chronological order favourite target criticism
simonides known charge high fees work pindar alluded isthmian 2 refers muse hireling journeyman
appeared many poetry competitions defeated five times compatriot poetess corinna revenge called her boeotian sow odes olympian 6
89 f
assumed ancient sources pindar's odes performed chorus challenged modern scholars argue odes fact performed solo
known how commissions arranged nor poet travelled widely even poems include statements like come certain meant literally
uncomplimentary references bacchylides simonides found scholiasts there no reason accept their interpretation odes
fact scholars interpreted allusions fees isthmian 2 request pindar payment fees owed himself
defeats corinna probably invented ancient commentators account boeotian sow remark phrase moreover completely misunderstood scholiasts since pindar scoffing reputation boeotians stupidity
old age death fame poet drew pindar greek politics
athens most important city greece throughout poetic career rival home city thebes also island state aegina whose leading citizens commissioned quarter victory odes
there no open condemnation athenians any poems criticism implied
example victory ode mentioned above pythian describes downfall giants porphyrion typhon might pindar's way covertly celebrating recent defeat athens thebes battle coronea 447 bc
poem ends prayer aegina's freedom long threatened athenian ambitions
covert criticism athens traditionally located odes such pythian nemean isthmian 7 now dismised highly unlikely even scholars allow biographical historical interpretations poems
last odes pythian indicates lived near shrine oracle alcmaeon stored wealth there
same ode says recently received prophecy alcmaeon during journey delphi
met me proved skills prophecy race inherit does reveal long-dead prophet nor form appeared
[nb 2] ode written commemorate victory athlete aegina
pindar doesn't necessarily mean himself uses first person singular
many 'i' statements generic indicating somebody engaged role singer
other 'i' statements articulate values typical audience spoken behalf subjects celebrated poems
'i' received prophecy pythian therefore might athlete aegina pindar
case prophecy must performance pythian games property stored shrine just votive offering
nothing recorded pindar's wife son except their names megacleia daiphantus
ten days before died goddess persephone appeared complained she divinity whom never composed hymn
she come her soon compose then
pindar lived eighty years age
died around 440 bc while attending festival argos
ashes taken back home thebes musically-gifted daughters eumetis protomache
post mortem pindar's female relatives claimed dictated verses her honour persephone after dead several days
pindar's verses inscribed letters gold temple wall lindos rhodes
delphi elected priest apollo priests exhibited iron chair used sit during festival theoxenia
every night while closing temple doors intoned let pindar poet go unto supper gods! pindar's house thebes became city's landmarks
alexander great demolished city punishment resistance macedonian expansionism left house intact out gratitude verses praising ancestor king alexander macedon
values beliefs pindar's values beliefs inferred poetry
no other ancient greek poet left many comments nature art
justified exalted choral poetry time society turning away
two centuries reflected shaped sentiments outlook convictions greek aristocracies
pindar spoke up passionate assurance
poetry meeting ground gods heroes men even dead spoken participants deep earth their heart listens
view gods traditional self-consistent homer's reverent
never depicts gods demeaning role
seems indifferent intellectual reforms shaping theology times
thus eclipse mere physical effect contemplated early thinkers such thales anaximander heraclitus nor even subject bold wonder earlier poet archilochus instead pindar treated eclipse portent evil
[nb 3] gods embodiment power uncompromisingly proud their nature violent defense their privileges
there rationalization religious belief within tradition least old hesiod abstractions personified such truth daughter zeus
sometimes wording suggests belief 'god' rather 'a god' e
god? everything[nb 4] implications given full expression poems examples monotheism
[citation needed] nor vocalize belief fate background gods unlike plays aeschylus example
pindar subjects both fortune fate divine will e
child zeus
short heracles pindar once ignored traditional image heracles supreme example heroic physique described short order compare short patron
selects revises traditional myths diminish dignity majesty gods
such revisionism unique
xenophanes castigated homer hesiod misdeeds ascribed gods such theft adultery deception pythagoras envisioned those two poets being punished hades blasphemy
subtle example pindar's approach found treatment myth apollo's rape nymph cyrene
god delphic oracle apollo all-knowing yet keeping anthropomorphic nature seeks information nymph third party case centaur chiron
chiron however affirms god's omniscience elegant compliment apollo pretended ignorant you sire know appointed end
[nb 5] apollo's abduction nymph presented shameful act
pindar's gods above such ethical issues men judge them ordinary human standards
indeed finest breeds men resulted divine passions pindar mortal woman loved god outstanding lesson divine favours handsomely bestowed
being descendents divine unions privileged mortals mythical heroes intermediate group gods men sympathetic human ambitions
thus example pindar invokes zeus help behalf island aegina also national heroes aeacus peleus telamon
unlike gods however heroes judged according ordinary human standards sometimes shown poems demean themselves
even case receive special consideration
thus pindar refers obliquely murder phocus brothers peleus telamon am shy speaking huge risk hazarded right telling audience will talk silence man's wisest counsel
[nb 6] theban hero heracles favourite subject poem depicted small order compared small theban patron won pankration isthmian games unique example pindar's readiness shape traditional myths fit occasion even flattering mythical hero
hero's status diminished occasional blemish rests summary view heroic exploits
patrons claimed divine descent such diagoras rhodes pindar makes men akin gods realize their full potential their innate gifts divinely bestowed even then success still depends gods' active favour
honouring such men therefore pindar honouring gods too
statements life after death self-consistent typical times
traditional ambivalence expressed homer complicated growth religious sects such eleusinian mysteries pythagoreanism representing various schemes rewards punishments next life
however poet glory lasting fame men's greatest assurance life well-lived
presents no theory history apart view fortune variable even best men outlook suited moderation success courage adversity
notions 'good' 'bad' human nature analysed any depth nor arrive anything like compassionate ethics near contemporary simonides ceos
poems indifferent ordinary mass people
dismissed phrases such brute multitude pythian ode 2
nor poems concerned fate rich powerful men once lose their wealth social status compared example bitter disillusioned poems theognis megara
interested successful men their good fortune success brings obligations religious artistic activities need patrons
whereas muses inspired homer relevant information language express pindar seems receive their inspiration role shape inspiration own wisdom skill
like patrons whom immortalizes verse owes success hard work well innate gifts though hires himself out vocation
muses oracle prophet lesser poets ravens eagle art such men hackneyed garland-making magical εἴρειν στεφάνους ἐλαφρόν ἀναβάλεο μοῖσά τοι κολλᾷ χρυσὸν ἔν τε λευκὸν ἐλέφανθ᾽ ἁμᾷ καὶ λείριον ἄνθεμον ποντίας ὑφελοῖσ᾽ ἐέρσας
plait garlands easy
strike up! muse welds together gold white ivory lily-flower snatched sea's dew
works pindar's strongly individual genius apparent extant compositions unlike simonides stesichorus example created no new lyrical genres
however innovative use genres inherited example victory odes olympian 3 announces invention new type musical accompaniment combining lyre flute human voice though our knowledge greek music too sketchy allow us understand full nature innovation
although probably spoke boeotian greek composed literary language tended rely doric dialect rival bacchylides less insistently alcman
there admixture other dialects especially aeolic epic forms occasional use boeotian words
composed 'choral' songs yet no means certain sung choirs use choirs testified generally unreliable scholiasts
scholars library alexandria collected compositions seventeen books organized according genre book humnoi hymns book paianes paeans 2 books dithuramboi dithyrambs 2 books prosodia processionals 3 books parthenia songs maidens 2 books huporchemata songs light dances book enkomia songs praise book threnoi laments 4 books epinikia victory odes vast varied corpus epinikia odes written commemorate athletic victories survive complete form rest survive quotations other ancient authors papyrus scraps unearthed egypt
even fragmentary form however reveal same complexity thought language found victory odes
dionysius halicarnassus singled out pindar's work outstanding example austere style αὐστηρὰ ἁρμονία noted absence maiden songs parthenia
surviving fragment maiden song does seem different tone due however fact spoken character girl ἐμὲ δὲ πρέπει παρθενήια μὲν φρονεῖν γλώσσᾳ τε λέγεσθαι
must think maidenly thoughts utter them my tongue
enough dithyrambic poetry survives comparison bacchylides used narrative
pindar's dithyrambs exuberant display religious feeling capturing wild spirit dionysus pointing forward ecstatic songs euripides' bacchae
these dedicated athenians written sung spring depicts divine energy revitalized world
φοινικοεάνων ὁπότ' οἰχθέντος ὡρᾶν θαλάμου εὔοδμον ἐπάγοισιν ἐάρ φυτὰ νεκτάρεα
τότε βάλλεται τότ' ἐπ' ἀμβρόταν χθόν' ἐραταί ἴων φόβαι ῥόδα τε κόμαισι μείγνυται ἀχεῖ τ' ὀμφαὶ μελέων σὺν αὐλοῖς οἰχνεῖ τε σεμέλαν ἑλικάμπυκα χοροί

victory odes so-called 'farnese diadumenos' roman copy greek original attributed polykleitos c
440 bc depicting athlete tying victory ribbon round head almost pindar's victory odes celebrations triumphs gained competitors panhellenic festivals such olympian games
establishment these athletic musical festivals among greatest achievements greek aristocracies
even 5 th century there increased tendency towards professionalism predominantly aristocratic assemblies reflecting expense leisure needed attend such events either competitor spectator
attendance opportunity display self-promotion prestige victory requiring commitment time and/or wealth went far beyond anything accrues athletic victories today even spite modern preoccupation sport
pindar's odes capture something prestige aristocratic grandeur moment victory stanza isthmian odes here translated geoffrey s
conway ever man strives soul's endeavour sparing himself neither expense nor labour attain true excellence then must give those achieved goal proud tribute lordly praise shun thoughts envious jealousy
poet's mind gift slight speak kind word unnumbered toils build share monument beauty
isthmian antistrophe 3 victory odes grouped four books named after olympian pythian isthmian nemean games panhellenic festivals held respectively olympia delphi corinth nemea
reflects fact most odes composed honour boys youths men recently enjoyed victories athletic sometimes musical contests those festivals
few odes however much older victories even victories lesser games celebrated often pretext addressing other issues achievements
example pythian 3 composed honour hieron syracuse briefly mentions victory once enjoyed pythian games actually intended console chronic illness similarly pythian 2 like private letter intimacy
nemean 9 nemean 10 celebrate victories games sicyon argos nemean celebrates victory municipal election tenedos though also mentions obscure athletic victories
these three odes final odes nemean book odes there reason their inclusion
original manuscripts four books odes arranged order importance assigned festivals nemean festival considered least important coming last
victory odes lacked panhellenic subject then bundled together end book nemean odes
style pindar's poetic style very distinctive even peculiarities genre set aside
odes typically feature grand arresting opening often architectural metaphor resounding invocation place goddess
makes rich use decorative language florid compound adjectives
sentences compressed point obscurity unusual words periphrases give language esoteric quality transitions meaning often seem erratic images seem burst out style sometimes baffles also makes poetry vivid unforgettable
pindar's power does lie pedigrees
lies splendour phrase imagery suggests gold purple sunset sky
lucas force imagination bring clear-cut dramatic figures gods heroes vivid relief
peculiar inimitable splendour style though sometimes aided magnificent novelties diction dependent them work magical effects simple words also frequent moments marvellous swiftness alike succession images transitions thought thought tone prophet speak voice delphi
richard claverhouse jebb odes animated
burning glow darted out shower brilliant images leapt white-hot spark across gaps unbridgeable thought passed through commonplace leaving luminous transparent melted group heterogeneous ideas shortlived unity suddenly flame died
gilbert highet these qualities found example stanza pythian 2 composed honour hieron θεὸς ἅπαν ἐπὶ ἐλπίδεσσι τέκμαρ ἀνύεται θεός ὃ καὶ πτερόεντ᾽ αἰετὸν κίχε καὶ θαλασ- σαῖον παραμείβεται δελφῖνα καὶ ὑψιφρόνων τιν᾽ ἔκαμψε βροτῶν ἑτέροισι δὲ κῦδος ἀγήραον παρέδωκ᾽
ἐμὲ δὲ χρεὼν φεύγειν δάκος ἀδινὸν κακαγοριᾶν
εἶδον γὰρ ἑκὰς ἐὼν τὰ πόλλ᾽ ἐν ἀμαχανίᾳ ψογερὸν ἀρχίλοχον βαρυλόγοις ἔχθεσιν πιαινόμενον τὸ πλουτεῖν δὲ σὺν τύχᾳ πό- τμου σοφίας ἄριστον
god achieves purpose fulfills every hope god overtake winged eagle upon sea outstrip dolphin bends arrogant heart many man gives others eternal glory will never fade
now me needful shun fierce biting tooth slanderous words
old seen sharp-tongued archilochus want struggling grown fat harsh words hate
best fate bring wealth joined happy gift wisdom
stanza begins celebration divine power then abruptly shifts darker allusive train thought featuring condemnation renowned poet archilochus grown fat harsh words hate
archilochus iambic poet working within genre licensed abusive scurrilous verse regrettable tendency viewpoint pindar whose own persona intensely earnest preaching hieron need moderation wealth wisdom submission divine will
reference embittered poet appears pindar's meditative response intrigues hieron's court possibly rivals condemned elsewhere pair ravens olympian 2
intensity stanza suggests culmination climax poem
fact stanza occupies middle pythian 2 intensity sustained throughout poem beginning end
sustained intensity poetry quintilian refers above rolling flood eloquence horace below refers uncontrollable momentum river burst banks
longinus likens vast fire athenaeus refers great-voiced pindar
pindar's treatment myth another unique aspect style often involving variations traditional stories since original audience familiar myths allowed concentrate unique surprising effects
reversing chronological order such effect olympian vii dedicated diagoras rhodes also resemble circular pattern beginning culminating event followed scenes leading up ending restatement account dioscuri nemean 10
myths enabled develop themes lessons pre-occupy particular mankind's exulted relation gods via heroic ancestors contrast limitations uncertainties human existence sometimes traditional stories embarrassment carefully edited example still my tongue here profits / tell whole truth clear face unveiled nemean 5 epode away away story! / let no such tale fall my lips! / insult gods fool's wisdom olympian 9 strophe 2 senseless hold man say / gods eat mortal flesh
/ spurn thought olympian epode 2
mythical accounts edited dramatic graphic effects usually unfolding through few grand gestures against background large often symbolic elements such sea sky darkness fire mountain
structure pindar's odes typically begin invocation god muses followed praise victor often family ancestors home-town
then follows narrated myth usually occupying central longest section poem exemplify moral while aligning poet audience world gods heroes
ode usually ends eulogies example trainers victor boy relatives won past events well prayers expressions hope future success
event victory gained never described detail there often mention hard work needed bring victory
lot modern criticism tries find hidden structure unifying principle within odes
19 th century criticism favoured 'gnomic unity'
each ode bound together kind moralizing philosophic vision typical archaic gnomic poetry
later critics sought unity way certain words images repeated developed within particular ode
others odes just celebrations men their communities elements such myths piety ethics stock themes poet introduces without much real thought
conclude requirement unity too modern informed pindar's ancient approach traditional craft
great majority odes triadic structure
stanzas grouped together three's lyrical unit
each triad comprises two stanzas identical length meter called 'strophe' 'antistrophe' third stanza called 'epode' differing length meter rounding off lyrical movement way
shortest odes comprise single triad largest pythian 4 comprises thirteen triads
seven odes however monostrophic
each stanza ode identical length meter
monostrophic odes seem composed victory marches processions whereas triadic odes appear suited choral dances
pindar's metrical rhythms nothing like simple repetitive rhythms familiar readers english verse typically rhythm any given line recurs infrequently example once every ten fifteen twenty lines
adds aura complexity surrounds pindar's work
terms meter odes fall roughly two categories half dactylo-epitrites meter found example works stesichorus simonides bacchylides other half aeolic metres based iambs choriambs
chronological order modern editors e
snell maehler their teubner edition assigned dates securely tentatively pindar's victory odes based ancient sources other grounds
date athletic victory date composition often serves merely terminus post quem
many dates based comments ancient sources access published lists victors such olympic list compiled hippias elis lists pythian victors made aristotle callisthenes
there however no such lists isthmian nemean games pausanias 6
