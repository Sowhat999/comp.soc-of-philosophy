theoretical contributions although wide-ranging brook’s philosophical interests centred two principal regions speculation understand nature place perception non-verbal representation visual arts elucidate relationship art histories works art dynamics cultural evolution
early work perception first publicly aired ‘perception appraisal sculpture’ important distinction later draws matching simulating non-verbal representational practices introduced difference calls ‘object accounts’ ‘picture accounts’ spontaneously give visually perceived things notably three-dimensional works art
crucial thinking idea non-verbal representation quasi-linguistic form communication
relies de facto socially efficacious substitutability thing another thing even cases relevant properties shared
argues perceptually mediated substitutive felicity must available pre-linguistic organisms language itself possibly evolved
brook’s elucidation concept art first called ‘experimental modelling actual possible worlds’ first comprehensively spelled out paper ‘a new theory art’
rather complex theoretical structure underwent continuous modification numerous publications memetic account cultural evolution developed
embraced dawkins’ concept meme potent factor cultural evolution analogous function gene biological evolution
however differed significantly dawkins other meme-theorists way understanding exemplifying meme
instead offering such examples popular song catchphrase insisted these things items cultural kind analogous items biological kinds such horse cabbage
just horse product appropriately activated genes argues popular song catchphrase itself meme
item predictable cultural kind generated exercising memes
memes purposefully directed actions exercised concerted ways contrasted mere behaviours
first unambiguously elucidated paper ‘art history?’
brook’s account art essentially unexpected recognition viability new memes spelled out book awful truth art 2008
succeeded semi-autobiographical book get life 2014 anthology papers perception representation art evolution history strung together along string text intended place them context personal history experience
