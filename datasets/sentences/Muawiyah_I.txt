early days before battle saffin muawiyah syrians also served under ali
according ali sometimes even set out without provisions without asking pay
call muawiya put themselves campaigns two even three times year caring wanted take them tabri 13410
even early shia sources ali felt syrians disciplined obeyed muawiyah telling people kufa allah wish muawiyya exchanges me like dinars dirhams takes me ten you gives me them
“o people kufa experienced you three things two others you deaf spite having ears dumb spite speaking blind spite having eyes
you neither true supporters combat nor dependable brothers distress

umar also introduced child benefit pensions children elderly
both ali muawiyah continued welfare state
ali extremely caring towards poor became caliph revenue land fadak continued go towards poor
because muawiyahs families previous opposition muslims before converted islam there still level resentment towards
relatives killed battles fighting against muslims
muawiyah felt after conversion islam over 20 years governor syria expanded state confronted romans built up good administration good economy therefore felt people should resent past
occasion mu'awiya ascended minbar praised allah
wanted speak lad ansar interrupted mu'awiya! makes you people your house entitled wealth us! no wrong action against you know other our slaying your uncle walid your grandfather 'uqba your brother hanzala
mu'awiya allah nephew you kill them

fault nor loss
ansari fault loss then? you spoke truth
you need something? yes
look after old woman sisters things hard us
mu'awiya take you treasury
boy took then mu'awiya resumed khutba
conduct towards non-muslim subjects muawiyah governed geographically politically disparate caliphate now spread north africa west afghanistan east strengthening power allies newly conquered territories
prominent positions emerging governmental structures held christians whom belonged families served byzantine governments
employment christians part broader policy religious tolerance necessitated presence large christian populations conquered provinces especially syria itself
policy also boosted popularity solidified syria power base
non muslim population autonomy their own laws based their own religions their own political religious heads
their judicial matters dealt accordance their own laws their own religious heads their own appointees
paid poll tax policing central state
muhammad stated explicitly during lifetime each religious minority should allowed practice own religion govern self policy whole continued
syria like many other parts empire remained largely christian
muawiya's wife maysum yazid's mother also jacobite christian kalb tribe
marriage maysum also politically motivated she daughter chief kalb tribe large jacobite christian arab tribe syria
kalb tribe remained largely neutral muslims first went syria
after plague killed much muslim army syria marrying maysum muawiyah also used jacobite christians against romans
relations muslims christians state good
umayyad's involved frequent battles christian byzantines without being concerned protecting their rear syria largely christian population
muawiyah reported observed messenger allah perform wudhoo ablution finished looked me 'o muawiyah! you get rule then fear allah just people
due statement prophet convinced day held accountable undertaking task best selling book shadow sword battle global empire end ancient world tom holland writes christians jews samaritans manichaeans treated well muawiyah
muawiyah even restored edessa's cathedral after toppled earthquake
savagely though muawiyah prosecuted wars against romans yet subjects no longer trampled rival armies no longer divided hostile watchtowers knew peace last
justice flourished time there great peace regions under control
allowed everyone live wanted
oldest history books al-waqidi's al-baladhuri state jewish christians population syria palestine accepted muslims
jews christians wanted stop roman–persian wars
persians looted jerusalem massacred 90000 christian inhabitants few years earlier 614
then romans returned 629 killed jews
jews delighted roman army removed jerusalem killed lot jews few years earlier 629 banned them jerusalem
ibn katheer umayyad mosque extended damascus ran out lead line roof
ruler al-waleed bin abdul malik sent people look lead through out syria
finally found lady warehouse full lead
enquiring price she am prepared sell unless weight valued price silver
too much al-waleed bin abdul malik purchase her even value silver
returned lady her willing give weight silver she replied since you willing pay then accept charity sake allah go onto roof place worship upon accepted her donation marked sheets words lillah sake allah
then realized lady jewish then respect her generosity courteously sheets lead these contributed israelite lady
tom holland says also listed believers graced starring role founding document state constitution madina whole quantities jews
later muslim historians clearly discombobulated attempt explain them away members three jewish clans supposedly native medina
simply three jewish clans mentioned historians feature anywhere constitution medina
there also another familiar problem our sources conflict jews suspiciously late
date heyday muslim greatness period authors every interest fabricating sanction prophet brusque slapping down uppity infidels
time jews just like christians never alert propaganda value martyrs most peculiar
peculiar fact appear downright implausible
far likelier seem compact recorded constitution medina muslims jewish warriors held firm culminated conquest palestine
early muslims felt following religion abraham described quran say allah speaks truth follow religion abraham upright
polytheists qur'an 395
political finesse manner similar byzantine administrative practices muawiyah instituted several bureaucracies called divans aid governance centralization caliphate empire
early arabic sources credit two diwans particular muawiyah diwan al-khatam chancellery barid postal service both greatly improved communications within empire
mu'awiya seen speaking people minbar damascus wearing patched garment
yunus ibn maysar al-himyari saw mu'awiya riding damascus market wearing shirt patched pocket going along damascus markets
muawiyah very skilled dealing romans
abdullah ibn zubayr see troubles ahead after death muawiyah opposed appointment yazid later muawiyah truly son hind deployed dexterity mental resourcefulness will never see after
tried impose something irritated lion claws unsheathed show audacity
knew give us even allow himself tricked tried
most artful men crafty thief
wished never lose just rock remaining summit pointing mountain abu qubays outside mekka
friends expressed surprise vastness gifts opponents them war costs infinitely
muawiya welcome subjects every hour day including mealtimes
therefore knew people thinking saying
muawiya governors maintained open table people come eat
once arab seated end room hesitate pull himself plate placed front muawiya
muawiyah you plunder very far! arab replied after year drought necessary well placed order find pasture! deliberations muawiyah people took place community mosque people free unconstrained towards khalif
muawiya rely old aristocracy looked merit loyalty
most prominent governors even qurayshi let alone umayyad
also faculty winning over retaining people distrusted like amr ibn al
most important early governor kufa mughira ibn shuba
tabri described al-mughira liked things run smoothly behaved well people ask sectarians their sect
say allah decreed you will continue disagree allah will judge creatures concerning disagree
people felt safe
until kharijites resorted violence then kufas agreed expel them
also paid lot attention economy agriculture allowed finance expeditions
according al-qasim bin mukhaimirah abu maryam al-azdi entered upon muawiyah blesses us your presence o abu fulan father common arab expression? hadeeth heard want tell you
heard messnger allah saying 'whoever allah entrusts authority over affairs muslims neglects needs wants poor amongst them allah will neglect needs wants
added muawiyah appointed man charge addressing people's needs upon hearing hadith
appointment muawiyah's son next caliph muawiyah's most controversial enduring legacies decision designate son yazid successor
yazid experienced militarily after taking part various expeditions siege constantinople politically inexperienced
marwan also wanted yazid caliph run things behind scenes become senior member umayyad clan after muawiyah's death
mohammad abu bakr umar also mistrusted marwan lived taif during their rule became friends hajjaj
tom holland writes tempers medina helped fact governor oasis none other fabulously venal slippery marwan
rumours abounded back last calamitous days uthman's rule double crossed war band come uthman
locals mistrust their governor ran particularly deep
nothing done helped improve reputation double dealing
ibn katheer book al-bidayah wan-nihayah year 56 ah muawiyah called people including those within outlying territories pledge allegiance son yazeed heir caliphate after
almost subjects offered their allegiance exception abdur rahman bin abu bakr son abu bakr abdullah ibn umar son umar al-husain bin ali son ali abdullah bin az-zubair grandson abu bakr abdullah ibn abbas ali's cousin
because muawiyah passed through al-madinah way back makkah upon completion umrah pilgrimage summoned each five aforementioned individuals threatened them
speaker addressed muawiyah sharply greatest firmness amongst them abdurrahman bin abu bakr as-siddeeq while abdullah bin umar bin al-khattab most soft spoken amongst them
abdur rahman bin abu bakr abdullah ibn umar mid level muslim commanders battle yarmouk took syria
abdur rahman bin abu bakr sister asmā' bint abu bakr also fought battle yarmouk opposed yazid
abdur rahman bin abu bakr first duel battle after taking sword hand over qays bin hubayrah lost sword while duel roman army's best horseman
two roman horsemen then came forward saying see no justice two you come against us
abdur rahman bin abu bakr replied came give my companion sword then return

then took horse men led abdullah ibn umar roman camp night attacked them then ran away
romans chased them dark tens thousands them fell down cliff an-naqusah creek river
abdullah bin az-zubair also commander various battles including north africa also involved siege constantinople
muawiyah then delivered sermon having stood these five men below pulpit full view people after people pledged allegiance yazeed stood silence without displaying their disagreement opposition fear being humiliated
saeed bin uthman bin affan son uthman also criticized muawiyah putting forward yazeed
tolerated muawiyah like yazeed
following year muawiyah removed marwan bin al hakam position governor madina appointed al-waleed bin utbah bin abi sufyan
according sources muawiyah warned son yazid against mistreating husayn ibn ali
final warning yazid husayn tell you concerning him? careful confront except good way
extend free hand literally long rope let roam earth pleases
harm show verbal anger never confront weapons war rather bestow generous gifts
give place honor near you treat due reverence
careful o my son you meet god blood lest you amongst those will perish death according ibn katheer book al-bidayah wan-nihayah muhammad bin uqbah death approached muawiyah wish ordinary man quraish living dhu tuwa never invested authority caliph muhammad bin seereen muawiyah brink death began mark out floor
then turned face marked out another spot floor after started cry say o allah! indeed you your book verily allah forgives partners should set up worship forgives everything else whom wills [an-nisa 448] therefore o allah make me amongst those you will forgive
al-utbi narrated father muawiya dying quoted following verses those present at-taweel poetry death inevitable because consciousness lies after death much awful lurid then o allah! reduce my lapses pardon shortcomings overlook my ignorance you forgiving
my mistakes my own attributable you you forgive me grant me refuge reported passed out once regained consciousness family fear allah verily safeguards whoever shows regard something sake does safeguard whoever shows disregard something sake upon uttering died
robert payne quotes muawiyah history islam telling son yazid defeat hussein surely preparing army against deal gently thereafter hussein descendent muhammad deal abdullah al-zubair switfly muawiyah feared most
muawiyah died either april 29 may 680
muawiya used bring water muhammad course service received shirt buried

muawiyah few rare virtues
muawiyah politically adept dealing eastern roman empire therefore made secretary muhammad
once peace established muawiya reconciled many people fighting each other generosity fairness
even most stubborn opponents often melt under generosity diplomacy
also managed through fine diplomacy balance out tribal rivalries
during mu'awiya's rule put practice advice muhammad given you rule well

umar heard single word concerning flog then punish utmost severity
you weak easygoing your relatives uthman replied you know umar kept mu'awiyah office throughout entire caliphate done same 'ali answered adjure you god you know mu'awiyah afraid umar umar's own slave yarfa? yes uthman
'ali went fact mu'awiyah makes decisions issues without consulting you you know
thus says people
’this uthman's command
you hear censure views muawiyah early non-muslim literature greek historian theophanus does call muawiyah king emperor rather 'primus inter pares' greek 'protosymboulos' first among equals midst 'symboulioi'
theophanus also referred umar ibn al-khattab primus inter pares after peace treaty hassan book great arab conquests hugh kennedy writes nestorian christian john bar penkaye writing 690 s nothing praise first umayyad caliph muawiya whose reign says 'the peace throughout world such never heard either our fathers our grandparents seen there ever any like it' muslim literature traditional medieval sunni perception caliph muawiyah wide spectrum
based written
early medinan literature hassan muawiyah there justice poor looked after scholars madina complain
ruler became unjust oppressive look after poor rebelled
yazeed took over people makkah madina abdullah ibn zubair rebelled early literature like musnad ahmed 4/216 there hadith like narration tells muhammad prayed god favor muawiyah allahumma o allah guide guide people
narration many hadith narration books
al-dhahabi says narration strong predication reference muhammad nasiruddin al-albani modern narrations critic also men predication reference trustworthy then explained how predication strong
even earliest pro-shia accounts al-masudi balanced
al-masudi ibn hisham earliest shia account muawiyah recount muawiyah spent great deal time prayer spite burden managing large empire
az-zuhri stated muawiya led hajj pilgrimage people twice during era caliph
early abbasid literature iraq books written early abbasid period like al-baladhuri origins islamic state provide accurate balanced history
ibn hisham also these events
later abbasid literature after killing off most umayyads destroying graves umayyad rulers apart muawiyah umar ibn adbul aziz history books written during later abbasid period anti umayyad later abbasid literature iran books written later abbasid period iran even anti umayyad
iran sunni time
there much anti arab feeling iran after fall persian empire
anti arab feeling also influenced books islamic history
al-tabri also written iran during period
al-tabri huge collection including text find sources
collection preserving everything future generations codify future generations judge true false
contain text like following narration reported two different sahabah abdullah ibne umar narrates heard rasulallah muhammad say “mu′awiyah shall die path islam
narrated jabir bin abdullah testified heard rasulallah muhammad say “at time death mu’awiyah shall counted member my muslim ummah
classical literature eminent sunni islamic figures abbasid period records asked my father ali muawiyah
ahmad ibn hanbal answered know ali lot enemies tried hard find fault found
such joined man verily fought battled praised extravagantly setting snare themselves
-abdullah bin ahmad ibn hanbal muawiyah's opposition ali manifested itself following practice instituted during caliphate verbal abuse insult ali ibn abi talib during sermons mosques
even done pulpit mosque muhammad medinah
practice lasted 65 years ended umayyad caliph umar bin abdul aziz
example tabari recorded muawiyah ibn abi sufyan put mughairah ibn shubah charge kufah jumada 41 ah sep
2 - oct
30 661 ce summoned
after praising glorifying god continue advise you quality yours refrain abusing ali criticizing asking god's mercy upon uthman forgiveness
continue shame companions ali keep distance don't listen them
praise faction uthman bring them near listen them
saad ibn abi al-waqqas narrated- muawiyah son abu sufyan gave order saad prevents you you refraining cursing abu turab nickname ali ibn abi talib? saad replied don't you remember prophet three things virtues ali? will never curse ali
[non-primary source needed][third-party source needed] nisa'i muslim narrate sahih hadith wherein muhammad summoned muawiyah snubbed continued eating meal muhammad then cursed muawiyah words may allah never fill belly! nisa'i sunni scholar accepted hadith there many others foremost being bukhari muslim compiled sahih muslim
argued arabic culture language expression colloquialism means wish person's belly full blessings god form food belly cannot take anymore wishes persons blessings without end
however two pre-eminent masters sunni hadith bukhari muslim rejected absolutely latter apology muawiyah
further nisa'i murdered recited hadith presence pro-muawiya arab-speaking syrians perceived curse muawiyah debases unreferenced suggestion term form praise condemnation
later abbasid literature syria ibn taymiyyah 1263 1328 muawiyah call himself khaleefah given oath allegiance fought ali
fought because considered himself khaleef deserving khilaafah
agreed upon himself affirm whomever asked
companions consider permissible initiate fight against ali companions
ali may allah pleased companions believed muawiyah companions must pledge allegiance show obedience ali due authority such there khaleefah muslims
considering them defecting obligation decided muawiyah companions should fought until fulfilled
obedience unity occur
muawiyah companions see obligatory upon them fought against consider themselves oppressed because uthman killed oppressively agreed muslims time killers ali's camp having authority over them ibn kathir 1301-1373 uthmaan killed oppressively may allah pleased
muawiyah demanding ali hand over uthman's killers may take vengeance them also umayyid
ali asking muawiyah respite until established himself then hand them over
same time requesting muawiyah surrender shaam
however muaawiyah refused until ali surrendered those killed uthman
according ibn katheer book al-bidayah wan-nihayah imam ahmed asked happened muawiyah ali recited verse nation passed away
shall receive reward earned you you earned
you will asked used al-baqarah 2134
modern sunni literature despite endeavours expansion caliphate establishment umayyad dynasty persona caliph muawiyah evokes controversial figure standard islamic history whose legacy never quite able shed taint opposition rashidun caliph ali ibn abi talib
late sunni theologian mawdudi founder jamaat-e-islami establishment caliphate essentially monarchy began caliphate muawiyah
wasn't kind muawiyah appointed muslims
mawdudi elaborated muawiyah wanted caliph fought order attain caliphate really depending upon acceptance muslim community
people appoint muawiyah caliph became force consequently people no choice give their pledge allegiance baiah
people given muawiyah their allegiance time wouldn't meant much losing their rank position much meant bloodshed conflict
certainly couldn't given preference over peace order
following hasan ibn ali's abdication caliphate muslims including sahabah tabi'een gave their pledge allegiance muawiyah bringing end civil war
year called aam al jamaat year congregation
mawdudi pointed out muawiyah's own speech during initial days caliphate expressed own awareness allah while taking charge your government unaware fact you unhappy over my taking over government you people don’t like
am well aware whatever there your hearts regarding matter still taken you basis my sword… now you see am fulfilling your rights then you should happy me whatever there
shia view muawiyah reviled figure shia islam several reasons
firstly because involvement battle siffin against ali ibn abi talib whom shia muslims believe muhammad's true successor secondly breaking treaty made hasan ibn ali after death hasan ibn ali broken terms being appointing son yazid successor thirdly because believe responsible killing hasan ibn ali bribing wife ja'dah binte ash'as poison sunni texts say wife killed fourthly because shia think distorted their interpretation islam match rule sunnis say distorted islam political leader certain time history whom hassan hussein also gave their allegiance say islam based quran teaching muhammad main center learning madina syria say islam completed time muhammad use verses day perfected you your religion completed my favor upon you approved you islam religion quran 55
indeed sent down qur'an indeed will guardian
holy qur'an chapter 15 verse 9
fifthly deaths various companions muhammad fought alongside ali battle siffin
according shia view muawiyah opposed ali out sheer greed power wealth
reign opened door persecution ali's supporters slaughtering followers unlawful imprisonment supporters worsened yazid came power battle karbala ensued
muawiyah alleged killed many muhammad's companions sahabah either battle poison due lust power
muawiyah killed several historical figures including sahabah amr bin al-hamiq muhammad ibn abi bakr malik al-ashtar hujr ibn adi families abu bakr umar condemned muawiyah sahaba deemed killer cursed abd al-rahman bin hasaan buried alive support ali
according shia muawiyah also responsible instigating battle siffin bloodiest battle islam's history many early history books state ali went north syria make syrians give allegiance
battle siffin over 70000 people among them many last surviving companions muhammad killed
notable among companions killed muawiyah's forces battle saffin ammar ibn yasir frail old man 95 time death
shia muslims see being killed hands muawiyah's army significant because well-known hadith present both shia sunni books hadith narrated abu hurairah others muhammad recorded group rebels kill you sahih muslim sahih al-bukhari
killing two children ubaydullah ibn abbas ancestor abbasids also found sunni books abbasid period shia texts
then [i
muawiyah] informed ubaidullah two infant sons
set out reach them found them - two tender forelocks like pearls - [and] ordered kill them
