philosophy although deeply interested traditional catholic teaching continuing attend catholic mass kenny now explicitly defines himself agnostic explaining believe both why theist why atheist
2006 book believe ch 3 why am atheist begins many different definitions may offered word 'god'
given fact atheism makes much stronger claim theism does
atheist says no matter definition you choose 'god exists' false
theist claims there definition will make 'god exists' true
my view neither stronger nor weaker claim convincingly established
goes true default position neither theism nor atheism agnosticism
claim knowledge needs substantiated ignorance need confessed
defends rationality agnostic praying god whose existence doubts stating surely no unreasonable act man adrift ocean trapped cave stranded mountainside cries help though may never heard fires signal may never seen
view kin christian agnosticism
