eventually built professional relationship galton measuring subjects working together research
1888 galton established lab science galleries south kensington museum
galton's lab participants measured gain knowledge their strengths weaknesses
galton also used these data own research
typically charge people small fee services
during time galton controversial letter times titled 'africa chinese' argued chinese race capable high civilisation opinion temporarily stunted recent failures chinese dynasties should encouraged immigrate africa displace supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks
heredity eugenics galton later years publication cousin charles darwin origin species 1859 event changed galton's life forrest 1974 p
came gripped work especially first chapter variation under domestication concerning animal breeding
galton devoted much rest life exploring variation human populations implications darwin hinted
doing established research program embraced multiple aspects human variation mental characteristics height facial images fingerprint patterns
required inventing novel measures traits devising large-scale collection data using those measures end discovery new statistical techniques describing understanding data
galton interested first question whether human ability hereditary proposed count number relatives various degrees eminent men
qualities hereditary reasoned there should eminent men among relatives among general population
test invented methods historiometry
galton obtained extensive data broad range biographical sources tabulated compared various ways
pioneering work described detail book hereditary genius 1869
here showed among other things numbers eminent relatives dropped off going first degree second degree relatives second degree third
took evidence inheritance abilities
galton recognised limitations methods these two works believed question better studied comparisons twins
method envisaged testing see twins similar birth diverged dissimilar environments whether twins dissimilar birth converged reared similar environments
again used method questionnaires gather various sorts data tabulated described paper history twins 1875
doing anticipated modern field behaviour genetics relies heavily twin studies
concluded evidence favoured nature rather nurture
also proposed adoption studies including trans-racial adoption studies separate effects heredity environment
galton recognised cultural circumstances influenced capability civilisation's citizens their reproductive success
hereditary genius envisaged situation conducive resilient enduring civilisation follows best form civilization respect improvement race society costly incomes chiefly derived professional sources much through inheritance every lad chance showing abilities highly gifted enabled achieve first-class education entrance professional life liberal help exhibitions scholarships gained early youth marriage held high honour ancient jewish times pride race encouraged course refer nonsensical sentiment present day goes under name weak find welcome refuge celibate monasteries sisterhoods lastly better sort emigrants refugees other lands invited welcomed their descendants naturalised
362 galton invented term eugenics 1883 set down many observations conclusions book inquiries human faculty development
believed scheme 'marks' family merit should defined early marriage families high rank encouraged provision monetary incentives
pointed out tendencies british society such late marriages eminent people paucity their children thought dysgenic
advocated encouraging eugenic marriages supplying able couples incentives children
29 october 1901 galton chose address eugenic issues delivered second huxley lecture royal anthropological institute eugenics review journal eugenics education society commenced publication 1909
galton honorary president society foreword first volume
first international congress eugenics held july 1912
winston churchill carls elliot among attendees
empirical test pangenesis lamarckism galton conducted wide-ranging inquiries heredity led challenge charles darwin's hypothetical theory pangenesis
darwin proposed part hypothesis certain particles called gemmules moved throughout body also responsible inheritance acquired characteristics
galton consultation darwin set out see transported blood
long series experiments 1869 1871 transfused blood dissimilar breeds rabbits examined features their offspring
found no evidence characters transmitted transfused blood bulmer 2003 pp
darwin challenged validity galton's experiment giving reasons article published nature now chapter pangenesis my variation animals plants under domestication word blood any fluid proper any circulating system
indeed obvious presence gemmules blood form no necessary part my hypothesis refer illustration lowest animals such protozoa possess blood any vessels refer plants fluid present vessels cannot considered true blood
goes admit nevertheless first heard mr
galton's experiments sufficiently reflect subject saw difficulty believing presence gemmules blood
galton explicitly rejected idea inheritance acquired characteristics lamarckism early proponent hard heredity through selection alone
came close rediscovering mendel's particulate theory inheritance prevented making final breakthrough regard because focus continuous rather discrete traits now known polygenic traits
went found biometric approach study heredity distinguished use statistical techniques study continuous traits population-scale aspects heredity
approach later taken up enthusiastically karl pearson w
weldon together founded highly influential journal biometrika 1901
fisher later show how biometrical approach reconciled mendelian approach
statistical techniques galton invented correlation regression—see below phenomena established regression mean formed basis biometric approach now essential tools social sciences
innovations statistics psychological theory historiometry method used hereditary genius described first example historiometry
bolster these results attempt make distinction 'nature' 'nurture' first apply phrase topic devised questionnaire sent out 190 fellows royal society
tabulated characteristics their families such birth order occupation race their parents
attempted discover whether their interest science 'innate' due encouragements others
studies published book english men science their nature nurture 1874
end promoted nature versus nurture question though settle provided fascinating data sociology scientists time
lexical hypothesis sir francis first scientist recognise now known lexical hypothesis
idea most salient socially relevant personality differences people's lives will eventually become encoded language
hypothesis further suggests sampling language possible derive comprehensive taxonomy human personality traits
questionnaire galton's inquiries mind involved detailed recording people's subjective accounts whether how their minds dealt phenomena such mental imagery
better elicit information pioneered use questionnaire
study asked fellow members royal society london describe mental images experienced
another collected in-depth surveys eminent scientists work examining effects nature nurture propensity toward scientific thinking
variance standard deviation core any statistical analysis concept measurements vary both central tendency mean spread around central value variance
late 1860 s galton conceived measure quantify normal variation standard deviation
galton keen observer
1906 visiting livestock fair stumbled upon intriguing contest
ox display villagers invited guess animal's weight after slaughtered dressed
nearly 800 participated person hit exact mark 1198 pounds
galton stated middlemost estimate expresses vox populi every other estimate being condemned too low too high majority voters calculated value modern terminology median 1207 pounds
surprise within 0
8% weight measured judges
soon afterwards acknowledged mean guesses 1197 pounds even accurate
same year galton suggested letter journal nature better method cutting round cake avoiding making radial incisions
experimental derivation normal distribution studying variation galton invented quincunx pachinko-like device also known bean machine tool demonstrating law error normal distribution bulmer 2003 p
bivariate normal distribution also discovered properties bivariate normal distribution relationship regression analysis
correlation regression galton's correlation diagram 1886 1846 french physicist auguste bravais 1811–1863 first developed become correlation coefficient
after examining forearm height measurements galton independently rediscovered concept correlation 1888 bulmer 2003 pp
191–196 demonstrated application study heredity anthropology psychology
galton's later statistical study probability extinction surnames led concept galton–watson stochastic processes bulmer 2003 pp
now core modern statistics regression
galton invented use regression line bulmer 2003 p
184 choice r reversion regression represent correlation coefficient
1870 s 1880 s pioneer use normal theory fit histograms actual tabulated data much collected himself instance large samples sibling parental height
consideration results these empirical studies lead further insights evolution natural selection regression mean
regression mediocrity galton first describe explain common phenomenon regression toward mean first observed experiments size seeds successive generations sweet peas
conditions under regression toward mean occurs depend way term mathematically defined
galton first observed phenomenon context simple linear regression data points
galton developed following model pellets fall through quincunx bean machine forming normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point
these pellets then released down second gallery corresponding second measurement occasion
galton then asked reverse question these pellets come? answer average directly above
rather average towards middle simple reason there pellets above towards middle wander left there left extreme wander right inwards p
477 theories perception galton went beyond measurement summary attempt explain phenomena observed
among such developments proposed early theory ranges sound hearing collected large quantities anthropometric data public through popular long-running anthropometric laboratory established 1884 studied over 9000 people
until 1985 these data analysed their entirety
differential psychology galton's study human abilities ultimately led foundation differential psychology formulation first mental tests
interested measuring humans every way possible
included measuring their ability make sensory discrimination assumed linked intellectual prowess
galton suggested individual differences general ability reﬂected performance relatively simple sensory capacities speed reaction stimulus variables objectively measured tests sensory discrimination reaction time
also measured how quickly people reacted later linked internal wiring ultimately limited intelligence ability
throughout research galton assumed people reacted faster intelligent others
composite photography galton also devised technique called composite portraiture produced superimposing multiple photographic portraits individuals' faces registered their eyes create average face see averageness
1990 s hundred years after discovery much psychological research examined attractiveness these faces aspect galton remarked original lecture
others including sigmund freud work dreams picked up galton's suggestion these composites might represent useful metaphor ideal type concept natural kind see eleanor rosch—such jewish men criminals patients tuberculosis etc
—onto same photographic plate thereby yielding blended whole composite hoped generalise facial appearance subject average central type
see also entry modern physiognomy under physiognomy
work began 1880 s while jewish scholar joseph jacobs studied anthropology statistics francis galton
jacobs asked galton create composite photograph jewish type
jacobs' first publications used galton's composite imagery jewish type galton's composite photographs photographic news 29 24 april 1885 268–269
galton hoped technique aid medical diagnosis even criminology through identification typical criminal faces
however technique prove useful fell disuse although after much work including photographers lewis hine john l
lovell arthur batut
fingerprints royal institution paper 1888 three books finger prints 1892 decipherment blurred finger prints 1893 fingerprint directories 1895 galton estimated probability two persons having same fingerprint studied heritability racial differences fingerprints
technique inadvertently sparking controversy herschel faulds last until 1917 identifying common pattern fingerprints devising classification system survives day
method identifying criminals their fingerprints introduced 1860 s sir william james herschel india their potential use forensic work first proposed dr henry faulds 1880 galton first place study scientific footing assisted acceptance courts bulmer 2003 p
galton pointed out there specific types fingerprint patterns
described classified them eight broad categories plain arch 2 tented arch 3 simple loop 4 central pocket loop 5 double loop 6 lateral pocket loop 7 plain whorl accidental
final years sir francis galton charles wellington furse given national portrait gallery london 1954 effort reach wider audience galton worked novel entitled kantsaywhere may until december 1910
novel described utopia organised eugenic religion designed breed fitter smarter humans
unpublished notebooks show expansion material composing since least 1901
offered methuen publication showed little enthusiasm
galton niece should either smothered superseded
niece appears burnt most novel offended love scenes large fragments survived
