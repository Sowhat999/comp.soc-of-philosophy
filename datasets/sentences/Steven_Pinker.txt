pinker also identifies himself atheist
2007 interview point inquiry podcast pinker states defend atheism empirically supported view
sees theism atheism competing empirical hypotheses states we're learning makes us tick including our moral sense without needing assumption deity soul
it's naturally getting crowded out successive naturalistic explanations
research theory pinker's research visual cognition begun collaboration thesis adviser stephen kosslyn showed mental images represent scenes objects appear specific vantage point rather capturing their intrinsic three-dimensional structure thus correspond neuroscientist david marr's theory two-and-a-half-dimensional sketch
also showed level representation used visual attention object recognition least asymmetrical shapes contrary marr's theory recognition uses viewpoint-independent representations
psycholinguistics pinker became known early career promoting computational learning theory way understand language acquisition children
tutorial review field followed two books advanced own theory language acquisition series experiments how children acquire passive dative locative constructions
these books language learnability language development 1984 pinker's words outlin[ing] theory how children acquire words grammatical structures their mother tongue learnability cognition acquisition argument structure 1989 pinker's words focus[ing] aspect process ability use different kinds verbs appropriate sentences such intransitive verbs transitive verbs verbs taking different combinations complements indirect objects
then focused verbs two kinds illustrate considers processes required human language retrieving whole words memory like past form irregular verb bring namely brought using rules combine parts words like past form regular verb walk namely walked
1989 pinker alan prince published influential critique connectionist model acquisition past tense textbook problem language acquisition followed series studies how people use acquire past tense
included monograph children's regularization irregular forms popular 1999 book words rules ingredients language
pinker argued language depends two things associative remembering sounds their meanings words use rules manipulate symbols grammar
presented evidence against connectionism child learn forms words simply retrieve each needed form memory favour older alternative theory use words rules combined generative phonology
showed mistakes made children indicate use default rules add suffixes such -ed instance 'breaked' 'comed' 'broke' 'came'
argued shows irregular verb-forms english learnt retrieved memory individually children making these errors predicting regular -ed ending open-ended way applying mental rule
rule combining verb stems usual suffix expressed vpast → vstem + v verb regular ending
pinker further argued since ten most frequently occurring english verbs say make
irregular while 98
2% thousand least common verbs regular there massive correlation frequency irregularity
explains arguing every irregular form such 'took' 'came' 'got' committed memory children each generation else lost common forms most easily memorized
any irregular verb falls popularity past certain point lost future generations will treat regular verb instead
1990 pinker paul bloom published paper natural language natural selection arguing human language faculty must evolved through natural selection
article provided arguments continuity based view language evolution contrary then current discontinuity based theories see language suddenly appearing advent homo sapiens kind evolutionary accident
discontinuity based view prominently argued two main authorities linguist noam chomsky stephen jay gould
paper became widely cited created renewed interest evolutionary prehistory language credited shifting central question debate language evolve? how language evolve
article also presaged pinker's argument language instinct
pinker's research includes delving human nature science says
interview point inquiry podcast 2007 provides following examples considers defensible conclusions science says human nature sexes statistically identical their interests talents form two overlapping distributions
any policy wants provide equal outcomes both men women will discriminate against other
individuals differ personality intelligence
people favor themselves their families over abstraction called society
humans systematically self deceived
each us thinks ourselves competent benevolent
people crave status power informs listeners read human nature book blank slate
pinker also speaks evolutionary psychology podcast believes area science going pay off
cites fact there many areas study such beauty religion play sexuality studied 15 years ago
thanks evolutionary psychology these areas being studied
popularization science human cognition natural language main articles language instinct words rules how mind works blank slate stuff thought pinker's 1994 language instinct first several books combine cognitive science behavioral genetics evolutionary psychology
introduces science language popularizes noam chomsky's theory language innate faculty mind controversial twist faculty language evolved natural selection adaptation communication
pinker criticizes several widely held ideas language needs taught people's grammar poor getting worse new ways speaking sapir–whorf hypothesis language limits kinds thoughts person other great apes learn languages
pinker sees language unique humans evolved solve specific problem communication among social hunter-gatherers
argues much instinct specialized adaptative behavior other species such spider's web-weaving beaver's dam-building
pinker states introduction ideas deeply influenced chomsky also lists scientists whom chomsky influenced open up whole new areas language study child development speech perception neurology genetics — eric lenneberg george miller roger brown morris halle alvin liberman
brown mentored pinker through thesis pinker stated brown's funny instructive book words things 1958 inspirations language instinct
reality pinker's proposed language instinct related claim grammar innate genetically based contested many linguists
prominent opponent pinker's view geoffrey sampson whose 1997 book educating eve 'language instinct' debate described definitive response pinker's book
sampson argues while may seem attractive argue nature side 'nature versus nurture' debate nurture side may better support creativity nobility human mind
sampson denies there language instinct argues children learn language because people learn anything
others sought middle ground pinker's nativism sampson's culturalism
assumptions underlying nativist view also criticised jeffrey elman's rethinking innateness connectionist perspective development defends connectionist approach pinker attacked
1996 book impossible minds machine intelligence researcher igor aleksander calls language instinct excellent argues pinker presents relatively soft claim innatism accompanied strong dislike 'standard social sciences model' sssm pinker's term supposes development purely dependent culture
further aleksander writes while pinker criticises attempts explain language processing neural nets pinker later makes use neural net create past tense verb forms correctly
aleksander concludes while doesn't support sssm cultural repository language just seems easy trick efficient evolutionary system armed iconic state machine play
two other books how mind works 1997 blank slate 2002 broadly surveyed mind defended idea complex human nature many mental faculties adaptive pinker ally daniel dennett richard dawkins many disputes surrounding adaptationism
another major theme pinker's theories human cognition works part combinatorial symbol-manipulation just associations among sensory features many connectionist models
debate around blank slate pinker called thomas sowell's book conflict visions wonderful explained tragic vision utopian vision views human nature behind right- left-wing ideologies
words rules ingredients language 1999 pinker argues own research regular irregular phenomena products computation memory lookup respectively language understood interaction two
words rules also title essay pinker outlining many topics discussed book
critiqueing book perspective generative linguistics charles yang london review books writes book never runs low hubris hyperbole
book's topic english past tense yang's view unglamorous pinker's attempts compromise risk being no man's land rival theories
giving example german yang argues irregular nouns language least belong classes governed rules things get even worse languages attach prefixes suffixes make up long 'words' can't learnt individually there untold numbers combinations
pinker connectionists doing turning over rocks base intellectual landslide caused chomskian revolution
stuff thought 2007 pinker looks wide range issues around way words related thoughts hand world outside ourselves other
