marx ken wilber's aqal pronounced ah-qwul basic framework integral theory
suggests human knowledge experience placed four-quadrant grid along axes interior-exterior individual-collective
according wilber most comprehensive approaches reality metatheory attempts explain how academic disciplines every form knowledge experience fit together coherently
aqal based four fundamental concepts rest-category four quadrants several levels lines development several states consciousness types topics don't fit these four concepts
levels stages development pre-personal through personal transpersonal
lines lines development several domains development may process uneven several stages development place various domains
[note 1] states states consciousness according wilber persons may terminal experience higher developmental stage
[note 2] types rest-category phenomena don't fit other four concepts
order account kosmos complete wilber believes must include each these five categories
wilber such account accurately called integral
essay excerpt c ways together wilber describes aqal suggested architecture kosmos
model topped formless awareness simple feeling being equated range ultimates variety eastern traditions
formless awareness transcends phenomenal world ultimately appearance transcendental reality
according wilber aqal categories — quadrants lines levels states types - describe relative truth two truths doctrine buddhism
according wilber none them true absolute sense formless awareness simple feeling being exists absolutely
[citation needed][note 3] other ideas mysticism great chain being wilber's main interests mapping calls neo-perennial philosophy integration views mysticism typified aldous huxley's perennial philosophy account cosmic evolution akin indian mystic sri aurobindo
rejects most tenets perennialism associated anti-evolutionary view history regression past ages yugas
instead embraces traditionally western notion great chain being
work jean gebser great chain nest ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout material manifestation although wilber
'great nest' actually just vast morphogenetic field potentials
agreement mahayana buddhism advaita vedanta believes reality ultimately nondual union emptiness form form being innately subject development over time
theory truth see also two truths wilber believes mystical traditions world provide access knowledge transcendental reality perennial being same throughout times cultures
proposition underlies whole conceptual edifice unquestioned assumption
[note 4] wilber juxtaposites generalisation plain materialism presenting main paradigma regular science

pre/trans fallacy wilber believes many claims non-rational states make mistake calls pre/trans fallacy
according wilber non-rational stages consciousness wilber calls pre-rational trans-rational stages easily confused another
wilber's view reduce trans-rational spiritual realization pre-rational regression elevate pre-rational states trans-rational domain
example wilber claims freud jung commit fallacy
freud considered mystical realization regression infantile oceanic states
wilber alleges freud thus commits fallacy reduction
wilber thinks jung commits converse form same mistake considering pre-rational myths reflect divine realizations
likewise pre-rational states may misidentified post-rational states
wilber characterizes himself having fallen victim pre/trans fallacy early work
wilber science wilber describes current state hard sciences limited narrow science allows evidence lowest realm consciousness sensorimotor five senses their extensions
wilber sees science broad sense characterized involving three steps specifying experiment performing experiment observing results checking results others competently performed same experiment
presented these three strands valid knowledge part iii book marriage sense soul
wilber calls broad science include evidence logic mathematics symbolic hermeneutical other realms consciousness
ultimately ideally broad science include testimony meditators spiritual practitioners
wilber's own conception science includes both narrow science broad science e
using electroencephalogram machines other technologies test experiences meditators other spiritual practitioners creating wilber calls integral science
[citation needed] according wilber's theory narrow science trumps narrow religion broad science trumps narrow science
natural sciences provide inclusive accurate account reality any particular exoteric religious traditions
integral approach uses intersubjectivity evaluate both religious claims scientific claims will give complete account reality narrow science
[citation needed] wilber referred stuart kauffman ilya prigogine alfred north whitehead others order articulate vitalistic teleological understanding reality deeply odds modern evolutionary synthesis
[quote 2] current work 2005 launch integral spiritual center branch integral institute wilber presented 118-page rough draft summary two forthcoming books
essay entitled integral spirituality? contains several new ideas including integral post-metaphysics wilber-combs lattice
2006 published integral spirituality elaborated these ideas well others such integral methodological pluralism developmental conveyor belt religion
integral post-metaphysics term wilber given attempts reconstruct world's spiritual-religious traditions way accounts modern post-modern criticisms those traditions
[citation needed] wilber-combs lattice conceptual model consciousness developed wilber allan combs
grid sequential states consciousness x axis left right developmental structures levels consciousness axis bottom top
lattice illustrates how each structure consciousness interprets experiences different states consciousness including mystical states different ways

influences wilber wilber's philosophy influenced madhyamaka buddhism particularly articulated philosophy nagarjuna
wilber practiced various forms buddhist meditation studying however briefly number teachers including dainin katagiri taizan maezumi chogyam trungpa rinpoche kalu rinpoche alan watts penor rinpoche chagdud tulku rinpoche
advaita vedanta trika kashmir shaivism tibetan buddhism zen buddhism ramana maharshi andrew cohen mentioned further influences
wilber several occasions singled out adi da's work highest praise while expressing reservations adi da teacher
sex ecology spirituality wilber refers extensively plotinus' philosophy sees nondual
while wilber practised buddhist meditation methods does identify himself buddhist
according frank visser wilber's conception four quadrants dimensions existence very similar e
schumacher's conception four fields knowledge
visser finds wilber's conception levels well wilber's critique science one-dimensional very similar huston smith's forgotten truth
visser also writes esoteric aspects wilber's theory based philosophy sri aurobindo well other theorists including adi da
reception wilber categorized new age due emphasis transpersonal view recently philosopher
publishers weekly called hegel eastern spirituality
wilber credited broadening appeal perennial philosophy much wider audience
cultural figures varied bill clinton al gore deepak chopra musician billy corgan mentioned influence
however wilber's approach criticized excessively categorizing objectifying masculinist commercializing spirituality denigrating emotion
numerous critics cite problems wilber's interpretations inaccurate citations wide ranging sources well stylistic issues gratuitous repetition excessive book length hyperbole
steve mc intosh praises wilber's work also argues wilber fails distinguish 'philosophy' own vedantic buddhist religion
christopher bache complimentary aspects wilber's work calls wilber's writing style glib superior suggests wilber tends overlook complicated aspects spiritual purification past-life interpretation
jennifer gidley compared rudolf steiner's educational approach wilber's integral operating system noting conceptual breadth wilber's narrative transcending both scientism epistemological isolationism
she also noted limitations wilber’s project such undervaluing gebser's text omission steiner
psychiatrist stanislav grof praised wilber's knowledge work highest terms however grof criticized omission pre- peri-natal domains wilber's spectrum consciousness wilber's neglect psychological importance biological birth death
grof described wilber's writings having often aggressive polemical style includes strongly worded ad personam attacks conducive personal dialogue
wilber's response world religious traditions attest importance grof assigns perinatal
quotes wilber mystics sages insane? because tell variations same story don't they? story awakening morning discovering you timeless eternal infinite fashion
yes maybe crazy these divine fools
maybe mumbling idiots face abyss
maybe need nice understanding therapist
yes i'm sure help
then wonder
maybe evolutionary sequence really matter body mind soul spirit each transcending including each greater depth greater consciousness wider embrace
highest reaches evolution maybe just maybe individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity—a total embrace entire kosmos—a kosmic consciousness spirit awakened own true nature
it's least plausible
tell me story sung mystics sages world over any crazier scientific materialism story entire sequence tale idiot full sound fury signifying absolutely nothing? listen very carefully just those two stories actually sounds totally insane? wilber am alone seeing chance natural selection themselves enough account emergence see evolution
stuart kaufman [sic] many others criticized mere change natural selection adequate account emergence sees necessity adding self-organization
course understand natural selection acting mere randomness chance—because natural selection saves previous selections reduces dramatically probability higher adequate forms will emerge
even enough my opinion account remarkable emergence extraordinarily complex forms nature produced
after big bang dirt poems william shakespeare quite distance many philosophers science agree mere chance selection just adequate account these remarkable emergences
universe slightly tilted toward self-organizing processes these processes—as prigogine first elaborate—escape present-level turmoil jumping higher levels self-organization see pressure operating throughout physiosphere biosphere noosphere
metaphorically mean use example wing elsewhere example eyeball indicate remarkableness increasing emergence
don't mean specific model actual example how biological emergence works! natural selection carries forth previous individual mutations—but again just isn’t enough account creative emergence whitehead called creative advance novelty according whitehead fundamental nature manifest universe

too wildly odds structural stage theory line wilber's philosophical idealism sees phenomenal world concretisation immanation higher transcendental reality realized religious experience
madhyamaka two truths doctrine discerns two epistemological truths namely conventional ultimate
conventional truth truth phenomenal appearances causal relations our daily common-sense world
ultimate truth recognotion no-thing exists inherently everything empty sunyata unchanging essence
also means there no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence
formless awareness belongs another strand indian thinking namely advaita buddha-nature ontological approaches posit such transcendental unchanging reality namely awareness consciousness
wilber seems mixing confusing these two different approaches freely attempt integrate everything conceptual scheme
perennial position largely dismissed scholars lost none popularity
mainstream academia favor constructivist approach rejected wilber dangerous relativism
