while still lack satisfactory scholarly biography remarkable scholar interested readers now access meticulous well-annotated translation sections al-tabari's chronicle constitute most important primary source history reign
anyone familiar al-tabari's chronicle knows formidable challenge poses translator especially attempting make accessible audience includes non-specialists

recounting history tabari used numerous channels give accounts
these both channels given same author work such example three different accounts start isnad al-harita
texts relating al-tabari thus extremely early witness reception al-tabari's text-indeed much earlier sources customarily pressed service improve our understanding ta'rikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk e
miskawayh ibn 'asakir ibn al-athir ibn khallikan
second since al-azdi writing decades following al-tabari ta'rikh say something reception al-tabari's ta'rikh among those immediately followed great master
al-tabari's history immensely significant agree precisely how became significant there no clear consensus
third-and returning forand's insight-al-azdi frequently drew same authorities tapped al-tabari whose works most part now lost such abu ma'shar 170/786 abu mikhnaf 157/774 al-haytham ibn 'adi 207/822 al-mada'ini around 228/843 'umar ibn shabba 262/878
29 qur'an says each thing enumerate [or in] kitab al-tabari appends verse way elaboration number amount extent-the knowledge any thing does escape us xxx 10
might suggest al-tabari considered kitab merely metaphor allah's knowledge
however al-tabari's comments elsewhere allah's knowledge quite evident speaking metaphorically
example 35
qur'an states length shortness person's life kitab explained al-tabari kitab allah written maktab computes knows xxii 71-2
al-tabari reports al-mahdi just promote harun heir apparent ahead musa died adds way corroboration another report al-mahdi set off masabadhan great hurry
however may doubted al-mahdi time shared reporter's subsequent knowledge imminent demise there none other reported circumstances death suggest hurry go anywhere
contrary sources general make clear gone masabadhan recreation occasionally say explicitly
al-tabari does say explicitly envoys sent provinces obtained oath allegiance al-hadi caliph also harun heir apparent wali l-'ahd 38
probably first occasion harun acknowledged
harun himself advice al-rabi' sent out these envoys must presented brother return fait accompli
after many exchanges recrimination own men after various attempts regroup becoming progressively disorderly army 'ali reported tabari most revealing passage explained acceptance arbitration such no sin failure judgement
nothing sums up moral religious complexity situation better sentence
group made big issue 'ali's dilemma kharijites reasons their own see clearly religious political issues involved agreed neither 'ali nor opponent turn incapable administering polity their own
tabari's account also brings out very clearly relates p
115 how assembled kharijites quite willing expound reasons their recession 'ali's forces refuse take leadership their own group situation quite characteristic religious purists confronted dirty politics
realistic depictions alternate formalized archetypal narrative
tabari careful give reports these conquests religious frame expressions such nu'aym 'umar victory god given [pp
25–26] abound though worth noting tabari describes initiation campaign pragmatic rather ideological terms
states 'umar's decision invade came result realization yazdajird making war every year suggested continue until driven out kingdom p
