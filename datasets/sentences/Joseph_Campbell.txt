comparative mythology campbell's theories monomyth main article monomyth campbell's concept monomyth myth refers theory sees mythic narratives variations single great story
theory based observation common pattern exists beneath narrative elements most great myths regardless their origin time creation
campbell often referred ideas adolf bastian distinction called folk elementary ideas latter referring prime matter monomyth while former multitude local forms myth takes order remain up-to-date carrier sacred meanings
central pattern most studied campbell often referred hero's journey first described hero thousand faces 1949
enthusiast novelist james joyce campbell borrowed term monomyth joyce's finnegans wake
campbell also made heavy use carl jung's theories structure human psyche often used terms such anima/animus ego consciousness
strong believer psychic unity mankind poetic expression through mythology campbell made use concept express idea whole human race seen engaged effort making world transparent transcendence showing underneath world phenomena lies eternal source constantly pouring energies world time suffering ultimately death
achieve task needs speak things existed before beyond words seemingly impossible task solution lies metaphors found myths
these metaphors statements point beyond themselves transcendent
hero's journey story man woman through great suffering reached experience eternal source returned gifts powerful enough set their society free
story spread through space evolved through time broken down various local forms masks depending social structures environmental pressures existed culture interpreted
basic structure however remained relatively unchanged classified using various stages hero's adventure through story stages such call adventure receiving supernatural aid meeting goddess/atonement father return
these stages well symbols encounters throughout story provide necessary metaphors express spiritual truths story trying convey
metaphor campbell contrast comparisons make use word like pretend literal interpretation referring sentence jesus son god rather relationship man god like son father
example according campbell genesis myth bible ought taken literal description historical events happening our current understanding time space metaphor rise man's cognitive consciousness evolved prior animal state
2000 documentary joseph campbell hero's journey explains god terms metaphor god metaphor mystery absolutely transcends human categories thought even categories being non-being
those categories thought
mean it's simple
depends how much you want think
whether it's doing you any good
whether putting you touch mystery that's ground your own being
isn't well it's lie
half people world religious people think their metaphors facts
those call theists
other half people know metaphors facts
they're lies
those atheists
scholars disagreed concept monomyth because oversimplification different cultures
according robert ellwood tendency think generic terms people races
undoubtedly profoundest flaw mythological thinking
functions myth campbell often described mythology having fourfold function within human society
these appear end work masks god creative mythology well various lectures
metaphysical function awakening sense awe before mystery being according campbell absolute mystery life called transcendent reality cannot captured directly words images
symbols mythic metaphors other hand point outside themselves reality
campbell called being statements their enactment through ritual give participant sense ultimate mystery experience
mythological symbols touch exhilarate centers life beyond reach reason coercion
first function mythology reconcile waking consciousness mysterium tremendum et fascinans universe
cosmological function explaining shape universe pre-modern societies myth also functioned proto-science offering explanations physical phenomena surrounded affected their lives such change seasons life cycles animals plants
sociological function validate support existing social order ancient societies conform existing social order survive
because evolved under pressure necessities much intense ones encountered our modern world
mythology confirmed order enforced reflecting stories themselves often describing how order arrived divine intervention
campbell often referred these conformity myths right hand path reflect brain's left hemisphere's abilities logic order linearity
together these myths however observed existence left hand path mythic patterns like hero's journey revolutionary character demand individual surpassing social norms sometimes even morality
pedagogical function guide individual through stages life person goes through life many psychological challenges will encountered
myth may serve guide successful passage through stages one's life
evolution myth campbell's view mythology no means static books describe detail how mythologies evolved through time reflecting realities each society adjust
various stages cultural development different yet identifiable mythological systems
brief these way animal powers hunting gathering societies stage evolution religion animistic nature seen being infused spirit divine presence
center stage main hunting animal culture whether buffalo native americans eland south african tribes large part religion focused dealing psychological tension came reality necessity kill versus divinity animal
done presenting animals springing eternal archetypal source coming world willing victims understanding their lives returned soil mother through ritual restoration
act slaughter then becomes ritual both parties animal mankind equal participants
mythos power myth campbell recounts story calls buffalo's wife blackfoot tribe north america
story tells time buffalos stopped coming hunting plains leaving tribe starve
chief's daughter promises marry buffalo chief return their reappearance eventually spared taught buffalo dance animals themselves through spirits their dead will return their eternal life source
indeed campbell taught throughout history mankind held belief life comes returns another dimension transcends temporality reached through ritual
way seeded earth early agrarian societies beginning fertile grasslands europe bronze age moving levant fertile crescent mesopotamia practice agriculture spread along new way understanding mankind's relationship world
time earth seen mother myths focused around her life-giving powers
plant cultivation cycle mirrored religious rituals often included human sacrifice symbolic literal
main figures system female great goddess mother earth her ever-dying ever-resurrected son/consort male god
time focus participate repetitive rhythm world moved expressed four seasons birth death crops phases moon
center motion mother goddess whom life springs whom life returns
often gave her dual aspect both mother destroyer
way celestial lights first high civilizations first agricultural societies evolved high civilisations mesopotamia babylonia observation stars inspired them idea life earth must also follow similar mathematically predetermined pattern individual beings mere participants eternal cosmic play
king symbolised sun golden crown main metaphor while court orbiting planets
mother goddess remained her powers now fixed within rigid framework clockwork universe
however two barbarian incursions changed
indo-european aryan people descended north semites swept up arabian desert carried them male dominated mythology warrior god whose symbol thunder
conquered mainly due superior technology iron smithing their mythology blended subjugated previous system earth goddess
many mythologies ancient world such those greece india persia result fusion gods retaining their original traits character now belonging single system
figures such zeus indra thunder gods now interact demeter dionysus whose ritual sacrifice rebirth bearing testament pre-indo-european roots still enacted classical greece
most part focus heavily shifted toward masculine zeus ascending throne gods dionysus demoted mere demi-god
demotion very profound case biblical imagery female elements marginalized extreme
campbell believed eve snake tempted her once fertility gods worshiped their own rights tree knowledge being tree life
also found significance biblical story cain abel cain being farmer whose agrarian offering accepted god while herder abel's animal sacrifice
lecture series mythos campbell speaks mysteries eleusis ancient greece demeter's journey underworld enacted young men women time
there observed wheat presented ultimate mystery wine being symbol dionysus much like christian mysteries bread wine considered incarnate body blood jesus
both religions carry same seeded earth cosmology different forms while retaining image ever-dying ever-resurrected god
way man medieval mythology romantic love birth modern spirit campbell recognized poetic form courtly love carried through medieval europe traveling troubadours contained complete mythology own right
power myth well occidental mythology volume masks god campbell describes emergence new kind erotic experience person person affair contrast purely physical definition given eros ancient world communal agape found christian religion
archetypal story kind legend tristan isolde apart mystical function shows transition arranged-marriage society practiced middle ages sanctified church form marriage falling love another person recognize today
essentially started mythological theme since become social reality mainly due change perception brought new mythology—and represents central foundational manifestation campbell's overriding interpretive message follow your bliss
campbell believed modern world function served formal traditional mythological systems taken individual creators such artists philosophers
works favorites such thomas mann pablo picasso james joyce saw mythological themes serve same life-giving purpose mythology once played
accordingly campbell believed religions world various culturally influenced masks same fundamental transcendent truths
religions bring elevated awareness above beyond dualistic conception reality idea pairs opposites such being non-being right wrong
