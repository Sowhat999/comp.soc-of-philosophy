optimistic god's ever-growing presence world
basic theological outlook summarised follows god deepest human longing faith god foundation theology
faith based personal experience god rational arguments existence god
besides find faith god quite meaningful
god meets deepest longings human heart never fully satisfied world offer
god provides fully adequate answer ultimate questions humankind life destiny
moreover common experience humanity leads faith god
vatican ii points out their part however believers whatever religion heard revealing voice discourse creatures
god forgotten creature itself grows unintelligible
perhaps most beautiful statement god bible god love
nature god love
remarkable official creeds church usually speak god omnipotent powerful
liturgical prayers mostly addressed almighty god eternal king supreme lord never all-loving god
out love god created world
vatican given us comprehensive explanation our faith creation true god own goodness almighty power increase own happiness nor acquirement perfection order manifest perfection through benefits bestows creatures absolute freedom counsel beginning time made once out nothing both orders creatures spiritual corporeal angelic earthly then human creature shares both orders being composed spirit body
statement makes quite clear god create world order get anything himself
fact there no need god’s supply no luxury provide
actually god created world bestow blessings creatures give them share own goodness
further kunnumpuram holds god’s saving work based love
vatican ii stated god goodness wisdom chose reveal himself plan salvation
through revelation therefore invisible god out abundance love speaks humans friends lives among them may invite take them fellowship himself
fourth gospel affirms god loved world son everyone believes may perish eternal life
thus god’s saving plan revealed gradually culminated jesus christ beginning end based love humankind world
part our faith god three
obviously triune god beyond grasp our finite minds
human language cannot adequately express mystery god
church means teaches god incomprehensible ineffable
same doctrine trinity great significance christian community well human society large
vatican ii points out indeed lord jesus prayed father ‘that may one… one’ opened up vistas closed human reason
implied certain likeness union divine persons union god’s children truth charity
faith catholic church jesus christ whom god sent us truly god truly man composed rational soul body
unfortunately people taken humanity jesus seriously
many jesus divine lord
new testament pictures jesus true human being
john unhesitatingly declares word became flesh lived among us
church divine-human reality casual observer church just social reality association human beings profess common faith participate common worship endeavour live common ethical code
believing christians church also faith reality
there grace-filled depth church
apostles’ creed profess believe holy catholic church
faith understanding church will articulated here
church purely human enterprise
god work origin development church
christians believe
paul speaks church god corinth cor
probably refers local christian community there
bible church living god most likely denotes entire world-wide assembly followers jesus christ
second vatican council 1962–65 spoke mystery church
church mystery because part god’s plan salvation
new testament particularly letters paul mystery refers divine design salvation humankind
god’s plan offer everyone possibility salvation assemble church those believe son
plan realized life death resurrection jesus christ
once achieved christ now being effected lives faithful through work holy spirit
church thus seen part parcel god’s plan save humankind christ jesus
say church mystery mean church part god’s plan salvation humankind also god times present active church
pope paul vi stated church mystery
reality imbued hidden presence god
expression church god also signifies church rooted experience god
just israel originated experience liberating god exodus too christian church sprang up experience saving god life death resurrection jesus christ
becomes member church sharing experience
against background see how significant ecclesia asia pope john paul ii exhorts church ever deeply rooted experience god flows living faith
then church fulfil vocation meeting place god human beings
pope declares church cannot therefore understood merely social organization agency human welfare
despite having sinful men women her midst church must seen privileged place encounter god human beings god chooses reveal mystery inner life carry out plan salvation world
church vision mission earliest days existence church aware same mission jesus father sent me send you
now kingdom central life mission jesus
main theme preaching referent parables content symbolic actions lk 1120 151-3
hence church too mission work establishment god’s kingdom
unfortunately change took place church’s understanding mission
many catholics tended believe kingdom god already come present catholic church
led different way looking mission
held goal church’s mission salvation souls brought through preaching gospel administration sacraments especially baptism
however gradually dawned church god save souls humans without help church
led new approach mission
purpose church’s mission now believed planting church every new places among even new peoples cultures
course time even understanding church’s mission found fully satisfactory
vatican ii stated church received christ mission proclaim establish god’s kingdom here earth
post-counciliar period both paul vi john paul ii held such view
taking these developments account wishes adopt holistic approach mission church
mind mission church collaborate god god’s work wholeness human person human community cosmos according pattern revealed jesus christ
essential element judaeo-christian tradition god present active world ours
purpose god’s activity promotion salvation
wholeness nearest english expression biblical idea salvation
salvation understood comprehensive sense
lots catholics still think salvation something purely spiritual salvation soul merely individual my salvation totally other-worldly salvation heaven
vatican ii rediscovered richness biblical view salvation
according council salvation something personal spiritual-corporeal communitarian societal both this-worldly well other-worldly
process begins here now will find final fulfillment age come
recent times becoming increasingly aware cosmic dimension salvation
destiny humankind cosmos inextricably intertwined
past christians often thought their relationship world terms domination possession use enjoyment
there little awe wonder before mystery universe
arrogant irreverent attitude creation largely responsible serious ecological crisis facing today
there christian tradition well indian tradition search harmony quest communion nature
fact final destiny humankind thought life new heaven new earth
god work transforming world new humanity god fashioning may fit dwelling-place
understood according pattern revealed jesus christ according kunnumpuram
revealed jesus christ god’s offer unconditional love sinful human beings
god jesus christ angry avenging deity god mercy compassion lets sun shine good wicked
also revealed jesus christ person accepts god’s offer love surrenders him/herself god love totally transformed
s/he becomes genuinely free ready give herself/himself away selfless love self-sacrificing service
finally manifested christ death leading fuller richer life law human existence
