philosophy generative linguistics ludlow's work generative linguistics revolved around three basic themes
first theme generative linguistics best concerned understanding explanation just observation data gathering
end generative linguistics interested underlying mechanisms give rise language related phenomena interest will often trump goal accumulating data
second theme calls ψ-language hypothesis
hypothesis underlying mechanisms basic elements posited generative linguists fundamentally psychological mechanisms generative linguistics branch cognitive psychology against noam chomsky's i-language hypothesis ludlow argues doesn’t follow cognitive psychology must therefore interested mental states individuated solely happens inside language user's head
consistent ψ-language hypothesis psychological states indeed syntactic states individuated part embedding environment
third theme ludlow calls principle methodological minimalism
thesis best theory criteria like simplicity formal rigor cannot given theory neutral definitions thus must really come down thing seek methods help linguists their jobs minimum cognitive labor
foundations semantics ludlow's earliest work semantics attempt combine work theory meaning contemporary work generative linguistics using resources parsimonious those typically used semantic theory—for example without using higher-order functions intensional objects deployed montague grammar
resources largely limited primitives like truth reference individuals
subsequent work explored ways formalizing alternative approaches semantic theory—including possibility formalizing wittgensteinian use theory expressivist semantics natural language say theory building blocks semantic theory expressions attitudes rather primitives like truth reference
philosophy language intensional transitive verbs ludlow's ph dissertation defended proposal dating back medieval logician jean buridan revived w
quine philosophy james mc cawley linguistics according so-called intensional transitive verbs like seek want really propositional attitudes disguise
subsequently developed these ideas collaboration linguists richard larson marcel den dikken
interpreted logical forms ludlow's paper semanticist richard larson interpreted logical forms advocated quasi-sententialist view propositional attitude verbs view criticized scott soames chapter 7 book beyond rigidity
ludlow's response soames involves idea propositional attitude reports supposed correspond fact going inside agent's head rather created speaker s benefit hearer h help h form theory agent being reported
crucial account idea lexicon dynamic speakers engaged conversation will negotiate coinage terms fly constructing attitude reports
dynamic lexicon ludlow's work interpreted logical forms led development view linguistic meaning according meaning shifts much common intuition suggests
rejects common coin view word meaning argues word meanings negotiated fly conversational partners build little microlanguages together
these ideas subsequently applied controversies epistemology see below

contextualism epistemology recent work epistemology pushed back against skepticism arguing knowledge attributions context sensitive—our standards knowledge vary context context
while philosophy class may know hands other contexts example chatting bar
ludlow initially argued there implicit argument positions standards knowledge
response criticism jason stanley book knowledge practical interests ludlow advanced doctrine calls cheap contextualism
idea dynamic lexicon view shifts word meaning ubiquitous meaning term know exception
contextualism epistemology just consequence these garden variety shifts meaning
natural logic ludlow written series papers logical form determiners words like no pursued idea their most interesting properties given purely formal syntactic accounts
work borrows central ideas medieval logic—the hypothesis key logical inferences reduced down just two basic inferences sensitive whether syntactic environment dictum de omni dictum de nullo—classical notions basically equivalent contemporary notions upward downward entailing environments
explain upward entailing de omni environment superset substituted any set
downward entailing environment subset may substituted set
