philosophy smith member traditionalist school metaphysics having contributed extensively criticism modernity while exploring philosophical underpinnings scientific method emphasizing idea bringing science back aristotelian framework traditional ontological realism
identifying alfred north whitehead's criticism scientism's bifurcationism physical reductionism
belief first qualitative properties objects perception corporeal objects ultimately distinct their respective quantitative properties physical objects studied different sciences second physical objects fact there meaning corporeal objects reduced their physical counterparts smith examines critically work cosmos transcendence 1984 cartesian roots modern physical sciences
proceeding critique scientism quantum enigma 1995 smith poses questions whether scientific method actually dependent scientistic philosophy isn't whether linking other philosophical frameworks provide better solutions way interpret physical phenomena
demonstrating no case either scientific method results depend upon require adhering scientistic metaphysics answers positive first question end result it's possible link scientific method any underlying metaphysics none
working then second question proposes linking scientific method thus modern sciences non-bifurcationist non-reductionist metaphysics form modified thomistic ontology showing how such move provide positive outcome solving apparent incoherences perceived quantum mechanics' phenomena
according smith such interpretation quantum mechanics allows usage hylomorphic concepts act potential properly understand quantum superpositions
example instead considering photon simultaneously wave particle particle two distinct position other counterintuitive constructs consider photon any other physical object first doesn't exist act potency
matter hylomorphic meaning word having potential becoming wave particle being here there etc
whether these outcomes will happen undifferentiated matter dependent determination imposed upon macroscopic corporeal object provides actualization
photon thus no strange having many potentials say individual superimposed potentials learning french and/or spanish and/or greek while reading and/or walking and/or stretching arms etc
further consequence such interpretation corporeal related physical objects aren't dichotomized reduced other anymore quite opposite together constitute whole different aspects dealt depending perspective
smith's understanding relationship corporeal physical objects extend interpretation biology become opponent darwinian evolution fundamental element species form causal history evolutionists favor
leads supporter intelligent design movement even though hylomorphic approach itself isn't widely adopted mainstream intelligent designers also favor causal history even though differently evolutionists
smith also taken stance towards relativistic rehabilitation geocentrism
important however note smith supporting ptolemaic medieval geocentrism such asserting heliocentrism absolutely false
rather argues according theory relativity both heliocentrism geocentrism merit scientific viewpoint since any scientific observations depend reference frame observer any observation made earth any near-earth satellites virtually geocentric respect
