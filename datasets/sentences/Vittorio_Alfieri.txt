character alfieri's character may best appreciated portrait drew himself own memoirs life
evidently irritable impetuous almost ungovernable temper
pride seems ruling sentiment may account many apparent inconsistencies character
less amiable qualities greatly softened cultivation literature
application study gradually tranquillized temper softened manners leaving same time perfect possession those good qualities inherited nature warm disinterested attachment family friends united generosity vigour elevation character rendered unworthy embody dramas actions sentiments grecian heroes
contribution italian literature dramas alfieri chiefly indebted high reputation attained
before time italian language harmonious sonnets petrarch energetic commedia dante invariably languid prosaic dramatic dialogue
pedantic inanimate tragedies 16 th century followed during iron age italian literature dramas extravagance sentiments improbability action chief characteristics
prodigious success merope maffei appeared commencement 18 th century may attributed comparison such productions intrinsic merit
degradation tragic taste appearance tragedies alfieri perhaps most important literary event occurred italy during 18 th century
these tragedies difficult pronounce judgment taste system author underwent considerable change modification intervals three periods their publication
excessive harshness style asperity sentiment total want poetical ornament characteristics first four tragedies filippo polinice antigone virginia
these faults measure corrected six tragedies years after those published along saul drama enjoyed greatest success productions
popularity partly attributable alfieri's severe unadorned style fit patriarchal simplicity age
though there considerable difference dramas there certain qualities common them
none plots own invention founded either mythological fable history
most them previously treated greek dramatists seneca
rosmunda own contrivance certainly least happy effusion genius partly founded eighteenth novel third part bandello partly prevost's memoires d'un homme de qualite
another characteristic common every alfieri's tragedy main character tragic hero freedom whose ambition need revolution push fight tyranny oppression wherever exist
usually accomplished most radical manner up killing tyrant face death himself afterwards
desire freedom bring hero dimension solitude pessimism internal torment keeps going despite knowing majority people around can't understand share views struggles goals almost impossible reach
concept called titanism
whatever subject chooses dramas formed grecian model breathe freedom independence worthy athenian poet
indeed agide bruto may rather considered oratorical declamations dialogues liberty tragedies
unities time place scrupulously observed ancient dramas rigidly adhered unity action interest
occupies scene great action ruling passion removes every accessory — event feeling
excessive zeal observance unity seems forgotten charm consists producing common relation multiplied feelings bare exhibition divested those various accompaniments give harmony whole
consistently austere simple manner thought chief excellence dramatic composition excluded scene coups de theatre philosophical reflexions highly ornamented versification assiduously cultivated predecessors
anxiety however avoid superfluous ornament stripped dramas embellishments imagination harmony flow poetical language substituted even best performances style though correct pure generally harsh elaborate abrupt often strained unnatural energy condensed factitious conciseness
chief excellence alfieri consists powerful delineation dramatic character
filippo represented almost masterly touches tacitus sombre character dark mysterious counsels suspensa semper et obscura verba modern tiberius
polinice characters rival brothers beautifully contrasted maria stuarda unfortunate queen represented unsuspicious impatient contradiction violent her attachments
mirra character ciniro perfect father king cecri model wife mother
representation species mental alienation judgment perished traces character still remain peculiarly happy
insanity saul skilfully managed horrid joy orestes killing aegisthus rises finely naturally madness finding same time inadvertently slain mother
whatever may merits defects alfieri may considered founder new school italian drama
country hailed her sole tragic poet successors same path literature regarded bold austere rapid manner genuine model tragic composition
besides tragedies alfieri published during life many sonnets five odes american independence poem etruria founded assassination alexander duke florence
prose works most distinguished animation eloquence panegyric trajan composed transport indignation supposed feebleness pliny's eulogium
