hofstadter himself i'm someone foot world humanities arts other foot world science

hofstadter collects studies cognitive errors largely solely speech errors bon mots spontaneous humorous quips analogies sorts long-time observation these diverse products cognition theories mechanisms underlie them exerted powerful influence architectures computational models developed himself farg members
farg computational models share certain key principles including human thinking carried out thousands independent small actions parallel biased concepts currently activated activation spreads activated concepts less activated neighbor concepts there mental temperature regulates degree randomness parallel activity promising avenues tend explored rapidly unpromising ones farg models also overarching philosophy cognition built making analogies
computational architectures share these precepts called active symbols architectures
