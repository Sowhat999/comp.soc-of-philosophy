claims six-layered neocortex deals increasing abstraction layer next
says low levels neocortex may seem cold mechanical because make simple decisions higher levels hierarchy neocortex likely dealing concepts like being funny being sexy expressing loving sentiment creating poem understanding poem etc
claims believe these higher levels human neocortex enabling factors permit human development language technology art science
