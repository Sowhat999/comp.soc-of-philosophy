however no document ever found any contemporary government stated appointment any form nobility
1666–1674 engraving gottfried wilhelm leibniz leibniz's first position salaried secretary alchemical society nuremberg
knew fairly little subject time presented himself deeply learned
soon met johann christian von boyneburg 1622–1672 dismissed chief minister elector mainz johann philipp von schönborn
von boyneburg hired leibniz assistant shortly thereafter reconciled elector introduced leibniz
leibniz then dedicated essay law elector hope obtaining employment
stratagem worked elector asked leibniz assist redrafting legal code electorate
1669 leibniz appointed assessor court appeal
although von boyneburg died late 1672 leibniz remained under employment widow until she dismissed 1674

main force european geopolitics during leibniz's adult life ambition louis france backed french military economic might
meanwhile thirty years' war left german-speaking europe exhausted fragmented economically backward
leibniz proposed protect german-speaking europe distracting louis follows
france invited take egypt stepping stone towards eventual conquest dutch east indies
return france agree leave germany netherlands undisturbed
plan obtained elector's cautious support
1672 french government invited leibniz paris discussion plan soon overtaken outbreak franco-dutch war became irrelevant
napoleon's failed invasion egypt 1798 seen unwitting late implementation leibniz's plan after eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy europe already passed dutch british
[citation needed] thus leibniz began several years paris
soon after arriving met dutch physicist mathematician christiaan huygens realised own knowledge mathematics physics patchy
huygens mentor began program self-study soon pushed making major contributions both subjects including discovering version differential integral calculus

leibniz promptly returned paris planned mainz
sudden deaths two patrons same winter meant leibniz find new basis career
regard 1669 invitation john frederick brunswick visit hanover proved fateful
leibniz declined invitation begun corresponding duke 1671
1673 duke offered leibniz post counsellor

also spent several days intense discussion spinoza just completed masterwork ethics
1677 promoted request privy counselor justice post held rest life
leibniz served three consecutive rulers house brunswick historian political adviser most consequentially librarian ducal library
thenceforth employed pen various political historical theological matters involving house brunswick resulting documents form valuable part historical record period
among few people north germany accept leibniz electress sophia hanover 1630–1714 her daughter sophia charlotte hanover 1668–1705 queen prussia avowed disciple caroline ansbach consort her grandson future george ii
each these women correspondent adviser friend
turn approved leibniz their spouses future king george great britain
population hanover 10000 provinciality eventually grated leibniz
nevertheless major courtier house brunswick quite honor especially light meteoric rise prestige house during leibniz's association
1692 duke brunswick became hereditary elector holy roman empire
british act settlement 1701 designated electress sophia her descent royal family england once both king william iii sister-in-law successor queen anne dead
leibniz played role initiatives negotiations leading up act effective
example something published anonymously england thinking promote brunswick cause formally censured british parliament
brunswicks tolerated enormous effort leibniz devoted intellectual pursuits unrelated duties courtier pursuits such perfecting calculus writing other mathematics logic physics philosophy keeping up vast correspondence
began working calculus 1674 earliest evidence use surviving notebooks 1675
1677 coherent system hand publish until 1684
leibniz's most important mathematical papers published 1682 1692 usually journal otto mencke founded 1682 acta eruditorum
journal played key role advancing mathematical scientific reputation turn enhanced eminence diplomacy history theology philosophy
leibniz's correspondence papers notes 1669-1704 national library poland
elector ernest augustus commissioned leibniz write history house brunswick going back time charlemagne earlier hoping resulting book advance dynastic ambitions
1687 1690 leibniz traveled extensively germany austria italy seeking finding archival materials bearing project
decades went no history appeared next elector became quite annoyed leibniz's apparent dilatoriness
leibniz never finished project part because huge output many other fronts also because insisted writing meticulously researched erudite book based archival sources patrons quite happy short popular book perhaps little genealogy commentary completed three years less
never knew fact carried out fair part assigned task material leibniz written collected history house brunswick finally published 19 th century filled three volumes
1708 john keill writing journal royal society newton's presumed blessing accused leibniz having plagiarized newton's calculus
thus began calculus priority dispute darkened remainder leibniz's life
formal investigation royal society newton unacknowledged participant undertaken response leibniz's demand retraction upheld keill's charge
historians mathematics writing since 1900 tended acquit leibniz pointing important differences leibniz's newton's versions calculus
1711 while traveling northern europe russian tsar peter great stopped hanover met leibniz then took interest russian matters rest life
1712 leibniz began two-year residence vienna appointed imperial court councillor habsburgs

even though leibniz done much bring happy event hour glory
despite intercession princess wales caroline ansbach george forbade leibniz join london until completed least volume history brunswick family father commissioned nearly 30 years earlier
moreover george include leibniz london court deemed insulting newton seen having won calculus priority dispute whose standing british official circles higher
finally dear friend defender dowager electress sophia died 1714
death leibniz died hanover 1716 time out favor neither george happened near hanover time nor any fellow courtier other personal secretary attended funeral

grave went unmarked 50 years
leibniz eulogized fontenelle before academie des sciences paris admitted foreign member 1700
eulogy composed behest duchess orleans niece electress sophia
personal life leibniz never married
complained occasion money fair sum left sole heir sister's stepson proved brunswicks large paid well
diplomatic endeavors times verged unscrupulous too often case professional diplomats day
several occasions leibniz backdated altered personal manuscripts actions put bad light during calculus controversy
other hand charming well-mannered without humor imagination
many friends admirers over europe
leibniz's religious views although considered biographers deist also claimed philosophical theist
philosopher leibniz's philosophical thinking appears fragmented because philosophical writings consist mainly multitude short pieces journal articles manuscripts published long after death many letters many correspondents
two book-length philosophical treatises théodicée 1710 published lifetime
leibniz dated beginning philosopher discourse metaphysics composed 1686 commentary running dispute nicolas malebranche antoine arnauld
led extensive valuable correspondence arnauld discourse published until 19 th century
1695 leibniz made public entrée european philosophy journal article titled new system nature communication substances
1695 1705 composed new essays human understanding lengthy commentary john locke's 1690 essay concerning human understanding upon learning locke's 1704 death lost desire publish new essays published until 1765
monadologie composed 1714 published posthumously consists 90 aphorisms
leibniz met spinoza 1676 read unpublished writings since suspected appropriating spinoza's ideas
while leibniz admired spinoza's powerful intellect also forthrightly dismayed spinoza's conclusions especially these inconsistent christian orthodoxy
unlike descartes spinoza leibniz thorough university education philosophy
influenced leipzig professor jakob thomasius also supervised ba thesis philosophy
leibniz also eagerly read francisco suárez spanish jesuit respected even lutheran universities
leibniz deeply interested new methods conclusions descartes huygens newton boyle viewed their work through lens heavily tinted scholastic notions
yet remains case leibniz's methods concerns often anticipate logic analytic linguistic philosophy 20 th century
principles leibniz variously invoked another seven fundamental philosophical principles identity/contradiction
proposition true then negation false vice versa
identity indiscernibles
two distinct things cannot their properties common
every predicate possessed x also possessed vice versa then entities x identical suppose two things indiscernible suppose same thing under two names
frequently invoked modern logic philosophy
identity indiscernibles often referred leibniz's law
attracted most controversy criticism especially corpuscular philosophy quantum mechanics
sufficient reason
there must sufficient reason anything exist any event occur any truth obtain
pre-established harmony
[t]he appropriate nature each substance brings happens corresponds happens others without however their acting upon another directly
discourse metaphysics dropped glass shatters because knows hit ground because impact ground compels glass split
law continuity
natura non saltum facit
god assuredly chooses best
leibniz believed best possible worlds actualize every genuine possibility argued théodicée best possible worlds will contain possibilities our finite experience eternity giving no reason dispute nature's perfection
leibniz occasion give rational defense specific principle often took them granted
monads leibniz's best known contribution metaphysics theory monads exposited monadologie
according leibniz monads elementary particles blurred perceptions another
monads also compared corpuscles mechanical philosophy rené descartes others
monads ultimate elements universe
monads substantial forms being following properties eternal indecomposable individual subject their own laws un-interacting each reflecting entire universe pre-established harmony historically important example panpsychism
monads centers force substance force while space matter motion merely phenomenal
ontological essence monad irreducible simplicity
unlike atoms monads possess no material spatial character
also differ atoms their complete mutual independence interactions among monads apparent
instead virtue principle pre-established harmony each monad follows preprogrammed set instructions peculiar itself monad knows each moment
virtue these intrinsic instructions each monad like little mirror universe
monads need small e
each human being constitutes monad case free will problematic
monads purported gotten rid problematic interaction mind matter arising system descartes lack individuation inherent system spinoza represents individual creatures merely accidental
theodicy optimism further information best possible worlds word optimism used classic sense optimal optimistic
theodicy tries justify apparent imperfections world claiming optimal among possible worlds
must best possible most balanced world because created powerful knowing god choose create imperfect world better world known possible exist
effect apparent flaws identified world must exist every possible world because otherwise god chosen create world excluded those flaws
leibniz asserted truths theology religion philosophy cannot contradict each other since reason faith both gifts god their conflict imply god contending against himself
theodicy leibniz's attempt reconcile personal philosophical system interpretation tenets christianity
project motivated part leibniz's belief shared many conservative philosophers theologians during enlightenment rational enlightened nature christian religion compared purportedly less advanced non-western counterparts
also shaped leibniz's belief perfectibility human nature humanity relied correct philosophy religion guide belief metaphysical necessity must rational logical foundation even metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable terms physical necessity natural laws identified science
because reason faith must entirely reconciled any tenet faith defended reason must rejected
leibniz then approached central criticisms christian theism god good wise powerful how evil come world? answer according leibniz while god indeed unlimited wisdom power human creations creations limited both their wisdom their will power act
predisposes humans false beliefs wrong decisions ineffective actions exercise their free will
god does arbitrarily inflict pain suffering humans rather permits both moral evil sin physical evil pain suffering necessary consequences metaphysical evil imperfection means humans identify correct their erroneous decisions contrast true good
further although human actions flow prior causes ultimately arise god therefore known metaphysical certainty god individual's free will exercised within natural laws choices merely contingently necessary decided event wonderful spontaneity provides individuals escape rigorous predestination
symbolic thought leibniz believed much human reasoning reduced calculations sort such calculations resolve many differences opinion way rectify our reasonings make them tangible those mathematicians find our error glance there disputes among persons simply say let us calculate [calculemus] without further ado see right
leibniz's calculus ratiocinator resembles symbolic logic viewed way making such calculations feasible
leibniz memoranda now read groping attempts get symbolic logic—and thus calculus—off ground
gerhard couturat publish these writings until modern formal logic emerged frege's begriffsschrift writings charles sanders peirce students 1880 s hence well after boole de morgan began logic 1847
leibniz thought symbols important human understanding
attached much importance development good notations attributed discoveries mathematics
notation calculus example skill regard
peirce 19 th-century pioneer semiotics shared leibniz's passion symbols notation belief these essential well-running logic mathematics
leibniz took speculations much further
defining character any written sign then defined real character represents idea directly simply word embodying idea
real characters such notation logic serve facilitate reasoning
many characters well known day including egyptian hieroglyphics chinese characters symbols astronomy chemistry deemed real
instead proposed creation characteristica universalis universal characteristic built alphabet human thought each fundamental concept represented unique real character obvious find characters signs suited expressing our thoughts clearly exactly arithmetic expresses numbers geometry expresses lines matters insofar subject reasoning arithmetic geometry
investigations depend reasoning carried out transposing these characters species calculus
complex thoughts represented combining characters simpler thoughts
leibniz saw uniqueness prime factorization suggests central role prime numbers universal characteristic striking anticipation gödel numbering
granted there no intuitive mnemonic way number any set elementary concepts using prime numbers
leibniz's idea reasoning through universal language symbols calculations however remarkably foreshadows great 20 th century developments formal systems such turing completeness computation used define equivalent universal languages see turing degree
because leibniz mathematical novice first characteristic first conceive algebra rather universal language script
1676 conceive kind algebra thought modeled including conventional algebra notation
resulting characteristic included logical calculus combinatorics algebra analysis situs geometry situation universal concept language
leibniz actually intended characteristica universalis calculus ratiocinator extent modern formal logic does justice calculus may never established
formal logic main article algebraic logic leibniz most important logicians aristotle 1847 george boole augustus de morgan each published books began modern formal logic
leibniz enunciated principal properties now call conjunction disjunction negation identity set inclusion empty set
principles leibniz's logic arguably whole philosophy reduce two our ideas compounded very small number simple ideas form alphabet human thought
complex ideas proceed these simple ideas uniform symmetrical combination analogous arithmetical multiplication
formal logic emerged early 20 th century also requires minimum unary negation quantified variables ranging over universe discourse
leibniz published nothing formal logic lifetime most subject consists working drafts
book history western philosophy bertrand russell went far claim leibniz developed logic unpublished writings level reached 200 years later
mathematician although mathematical notion function implicit trigonometric logarithmic tables existed day leibniz first 1692 1694 employ explicitly denote any several geometric concepts derived curve such abscissa ordinate tangent chord perpendicular
18 th century function lost these geometrical associations
leibniz first see coefficients system linear equations arranged array now called matrix manipulated find solution system any
method later called gaussian elimination
leibniz's discoveries boolean algebra symbolic logic also relevant mathematics discussed preceding section
best overview leibniz's writings calculus may found bos 1974
calculus leibniz credited along sir isaac newton discovery calculus differential integral calculus
according leibniz's notebooks critical breakthrough occurred november 1675 employed integral calculus first time find area under graph function = ƒx
introduced several notations used day instance integral sign ∫ representing elongated s latin word summa used differentials latin word differentia
cleverly suggestive notation calculus probably most enduring mathematical legacy
leibniz publish anything calculus until 1684
product rule differential calculus still called leibniz's law
addition theorem tells how differentiate under integral sign called leibniz integral rule
leibniz exploited infinitesimals developing calculus manipulating them ways suggesting paradoxical algebraic properties
george berkeley tract called analyst also de motu criticized these
recent study argues leibnizian calculus free contradictions better grounded berkeley's empiricist criticisms
1711 until death leibniz engaged dispute john keill newton others over whether leibniz invented calculus independently newton
subject treated length article leibniz-newton controversy
use infinitesimals mathematics frowned upon followers karl weierstrass[citation needed] survived science engineering even rigorous mathematics via fundamental computational device known differential
beginning 1960 abraham robinson worked out rigorous foundation leibniz's infinitesimals using model theory context field hyperreal numbers
resulting non-standard analysis seen belated vindication leibniz's mathematical reasoning
robinson's transfer principle mathematical implementation leibniz's heuristic law continuity while standard part function implements leibnizian transcendental law homogeneity
topology leibniz first use term analysis situs later used 19 th century refer now known topology
there two takes situation
hand mates citing 1954 paper german jacob freudenthal argues although leibniz situs sequence points completely determined distance them altered those distances altered admirer euler famous 1736 paper solving königsberg bridge problem generalizations used term geometria situs such sense situs remains unchanged under topological deformations
mistakenly credits leibniz originating concept
sometimes realized leibniz used term entirely different sense hence hardly considered founder part mathematics
hideaki hirano argues differently quoting mandelbrot sample leibniz' scientific works sobering experience
next calculus other thoughts carried out completion number variety premonitory thrusts overwhelming
saw examples 'packing'
my leibniz mania further reinforced finding moment hero attached importance geometric scaling
euclidis prota
attempt tighten euclid's axioms states
'i diverse definitions straight line
straight line curve any part similar whole alone property among curves among sets
claim proved today
thus fractal geometry promoted mandelbrot drew leibniz's notions self-similarity principle continuity natura non saltum facit
also see leibniz metaphysical vein straight line curve any part similar whole anticipating topology two centuries
packing leibniz friend correspondent des bosses imagine circle then inscribe within three congruent circles maximum radius latter smaller circles filled three even smaller circles same procedure
process continued infinitely arises good idea self-similarity
leibniz's improvement euclid's axiom contains same concept
scientist engineer leibniz's writings currently discussed their anticipations possible discoveries yet recognized ways advancing present knowledge
much writing physics included gerhardt's mathematical writings
physics see also dynamism metaphysics conatus § leibniz leibniz contributed fair amount statics dynamics emerging around often disagreeing descartes newton
devised new theory motion dynamics based kinetic energy potential energy posited space relative whereas newton thoroughly convinced space absolute
important example leibniz's mature physical thinking specimen dynamicum 1695
until discovery subatomic particles quantum mechanics governing them many leibniz's speculative ideas aspects nature reducible statics dynamics made little sense
instance anticipated albert einstein arguing against newton space time motion relative absolute my own opinion once hold space something merely relative time hold order coexistences time order successions
leibniz's relationist notion space time against newton's substantivalist views
according newton's substantivalism space time entities their own right existing independently things
leibniz's relationism other hand describes space time systems relations exist objects
rise general relativity subsequent work history physics put leibniz's stance favorable light
leibniz's projects recast newton's theory vortex theory
however project went beyond vortex theory since heart there attempt explain most difficult problems physics origin cohesion matter
leibniz's rule derivatives products important often overlooked step many proofs diverse fields physics
principle sufficient reason invoked recent cosmology identity indiscernibles quantum mechanics field even credit having anticipated sense
those advocate digital philosophy recent direction cosmology claim leibniz precursor
vis viva leibniz's vis viva latin living force mv2 twice modern kinetic energy
realized total energy conserved certain mechanical systems considered innate motive characteristic matter
here too thinking gave rise another regrettable nationalistic dispute
vis viva seen rivaling conservation momentum championed newton england descartes france hence academics those countries tended neglect leibniz's idea
reality both energy momentum conserved two approaches equally valid
other natural science proposing earth molten core anticipated modern geology
embryology preformationist also proposed organisms outcome combination infinite number possible microstructures their powers
life sciences paleontology revealed amazing transformist intuition fueled study comparative anatomy fossils
principal works subject protogaea unpublished lifetime recently published english first time
worked out primal organismic theory
medicine exhorted physicians time—with results—to ground their theories detailed comparative observations verified experiments distinguish firmly scientific metaphysical points view
social science much leibniz's work went great impact field psychology
theory regarding consciousness relation principle continuity seen early theory regarding stages sleep
believed principle phenomena found nature continuous default likely transition conscious unconscious states intermediary steps
though leibniz's ideas regarding pre-established harmony rejected many psychologists embraced ideas psychophysical parallelism
idea refers mind–body problem stating mind brain act upon each other act alongside each other separately harmony
leibniz believed mind very active role perception plays much larger role sensory input
focused heavily perception distinguishing type perception conscious stimulus other being aware distinct perception
thought there many petites perceptions small perceptions perceive unaware
example bag rice spilled see rice necessarily aware how many grains pile
principle there infinite number perceptions within us any given time unaware
true there must also portion mind unaware any given time
way leibniz's theory perception viewed many theories leading up idea unconscious
additionally idea subliminal stimuli traced back theory small perceptions
leibniz direct influence ernst platner credited originally coining term unbewußtseyn unconscious
leibniz's ideas regarding music tonal perception went influence laboratory studies wilhelm wundt
public health advocated establishing medical administrative authority powers over epidemiology veterinary medicine
worked set up coherent medical training program oriented towards public health preventive measures
economic policy proposed tax reforms national insurance program discussed balance trade
even proposed something akin much later emerged game theory
sociology laid ground communication theory
technology 1906 garland published volume leibniz's writings bearing many practical inventions engineering work
date few these writings translated english
nevertheless well understood leibniz serious inventor engineer applied scientist great respect practical life
following motto theoria cum praxi urged theory combined practical application thus claimed father applied science
designed wind-driven propellers water pumps mining machines extract ore hydraulic presses lamps submarines clocks etc
denis papin invented steam engine
even proposed method desalinating water
1680 1685 struggled overcome chronic flooding afflicted ducal silver mines harz mountains succeed
computation leibniz may first computer scientist information theorist
early life documented binary numeral system base 2 then revisited system throughout career
anticipated lagrangian interpolation algorithmic information theory
calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects universal turing machine
1961 norbert wiener suggested leibniz should considered patron saint cybernetics
1671 leibniz began invent machine execute four arithmetic operations gradually improving over number years
stepped reckoner attracted fair attention basis election royal society 1673
number such machines made during years hanover craftsman working under supervision
unambiguous success because fully mechanize carry operation
couturat reported finding unpublished note leibniz dated 1674 describing machine capable performing algebraic operations
leibniz also devised now reproduced cipher machine recovered nicholas rescher 2010
1693 leibniz released public design machine theory integrate differential equations
leibniz groping towards hardware software concepts worked out much later charles babbage ada lovelace
1679 while mulling over binary arithmetic leibniz imagined machine binary numbers represented marbles governed rudimentary sort punched cards
modern electronic digital computers replace leibniz's marbles moving gravity shift registers voltage gradients pulses electrons otherwise run roughly leibniz envisioned 1679
librarian while serving librarian ducal libraries hanover wolfenbuettel leibniz effectively became founders library science
latter library enormous day contained 100000 volumes leibniz helped design new building believed first building explicitly designed library
also designed book indexing system ignorance other such system then extant bodleian library oxford university
also called publishers distribute abstracts new titles produced each year standard form facilitate indexing
hoped abstracting project eventually include everything printed day back gutenberg
neither proposal met success time something like them became standard practice among english language publishers during 20 th century under aegis library congress british library
called creation empirical database way further sciences
characteristica universalis calculus ratiocinator community minds—intended among other things bring political religious unity europe—can seen distant unwitting anticipations artificial languages e
esperanto rivals symbolic logic even world wide web
advocate scientific societies leibniz emphasized research collaborative endeavor
hence warmly advocated formation national scientific societies along lines british royal society french academie royale des sciences
specifically correspondence travels urged creation such societies dresden saint petersburg vienna berlin
such project came fruition 1700 berlin academy sciences created
leibniz drew up first statutes served first president remainder life
academy evolved german academy sciences publisher ongoing critical edition works
lawyer moralist possible exception marcus aurelius no philosopher ever much experience practical affairs state leibniz
leibniz's writings law ethics politics long overlooked english-speaking scholars changed late
while leibniz no apologist absolute monarchy like hobbes tyranny any form neither echo political constitutional views contemporary john locke views invoked support democracy 18 th-century america later elsewhere
following excerpt 1695 letter baron j
boyneburg's son philipp very revealing leibniz's political sentiments
great question power sovereigns obedience their peoples owe them usually say good princes persuaded their people right resist them people other hand persuaded obey them passively
am however quite opinion grotius ought obey rule evil revolution being greater beyond comparison evils causing
yet recognize prince go such excess place well-being state such danger obligation endure ceases
most rare however theologian authorizes violence under pretext should take care against excess excess being infinitely dangerous deficiency
1677 leibniz called european confederation governed council senate whose members represent entire nations free vote their consciences sometimes considered anticipation european union
believed europe adopt uniform religion
reiterated these proposals 1715
same time arrived propose interreligious multicultural project create universal system justice required broad interdisciplinary perspective
order combined linguistics especially sinology moral law philosophy management economics politics
ecumenism leibniz devoted considerable intellectual diplomatic effort now called ecumenical endeavor seeking reconcile first roman catholic lutheran churches later lutheran reformed churches
respect followed example early patrons baron von boyneburg duke john frederick—both cradle lutherans converted catholicism adults—who encourage reunion two faiths warmly welcomed such endeavors others
house brunswick remained lutheran because duke's children follow their father
these efforts included corresponding french bishop jacques-bénigne bossuet involved leibniz fair bit theological controversy
evidently thought thoroughgoing application reason suffice heal breach caused reformation
philologist leibniz philologist avid student languages eagerly latching any information vocabulary grammar came way
refuted belief widely held christian scholars day hebrew primeval language human race
also refuted argument advanced swedish scholars day form proto-swedish ancestor germanic languages
puzzled over origins slavic languages aware existence sanskrit fascinated classical chinese
published princeps editio first modern edition late medieval chronicon holtzatiae latin chronicle county holstein
