also minister orthodox presbyterian church 1930 s until death 1987 denomination embroiled bitter dispute gordon clark over god's incomprehensibility known clark–van til controversy according van til's pupil john frame neither man best neither quite understood other's position
thought van til drew upon works dutch calvinist philosophers such
vollenhoven herman dooyeweerd hendrik g
stoker theologians such herman bavinck abraham kuyper bring together fresh decidedly reformed approach christian apologetics opposed traditional methodology reasoning supposition there neutral middle-ground non-christian christian agree
contribution neo-calvinist approach dooyeweerd stoker others insist ground motive christian philosophy must derived historical terms christian faith
particular argued trinity indispensable insuperable value christian philosophy
van til theologian john frame sympathetic critic van til describes van til's contributions christian thought comparable magnitude those immanuel kant non-christian philosophy
indicates van til identified disciplines systematic theology apologetics seeing former positive statement christian faith latter defense statement difference emphasis rather subject matter
frame summarizes van til's legacy new applications traditional doctrines unoriginal doctrinal formulations may use those formulations application them often quite remarkable
sovereignty god becomes epistemological well religious metaphysical principle
trinity becomes answer philosophical problem many
common grace becomes key christian philosophy history
these new applications familiar doctrines inevitably increase [christians'] understanding doctrines themselves [they] come thereby new appreciation these doctrines demand [them]
similarly van til's application doctrines total depravity ultimate authority god led reforming discipline apologetics
specifically denied neutrality basis total depravity man invasive effects sin man's reasoning ability per usual calvinistic understanding first chapter epistle romans insisted bible viewed divinely inspired book trusted preeminently because believed christian's ultimate commitment must rest ultimate authority god
frame says elsewhere foundation van til's system most persuasive principle rejection autonomy since christian thinking like christian life subject god's lordship
however very feature caused christian apologists reject van til's approach
trethewie describes van til's system nothing priori dogmatic transcendental irrationalism attempted give christian name
kuyper–warfield synthesis fideism accurately describes view fellow dutchman abraham kuyper inspired much van til's thought
van til seen taking side kuyper against alma mater princeton seminary particularly against princeton professor
van til described approach apologetics synthesis these two approaches tried use elements both kuyper's warfield's thinking
greg bahnsen student van til most prominent defenders expositors person explain ways van til agreed disagreed both warfield kuyper person understands presuppositional apologetics
kuyper van til believed christian non-christian different ultimate standards presuppositions color interpretation every fact every area life
warfield believed rational proof christianity possible positively hodge warfield quite right stressing fact christianity meets every legitimate demand reason
surely christianity irrational
sure must accepted faith surely must taken blind faith
christianity capable rational defense
like warfield van til believed holy spirit will use arguments against unbelief means convert non-believers
van til sought third way kuyper warfield
answer question how you argue someone different presuppositions? transcendental argument argument seeks prove certain presuppositions necessary possibility rationality
christian non-christian different presuppositions according van til christian's presuppositions allow possibility human rationality intelligible experience
rejecting absolutely rational god determines whatsoever comes pass presupposing non-rational force ultimately determines nature universe non-christian cannot account rationality
van til claims non-christian presuppositions reduce absurdity self-defeating
thus non-christians reason being inconsistent their presuppositions
unbeliever's ability reason based fact despite believes god's creature living god's world
hence van til arrives famous assertion there no neutral common ground christians non-christians because their presuppositions their ultimate principles interpretation different because non-christians act think inconsistently regard their presuppositions common ground found
task christian apologist point out difference ultimate principles then show why non-christian's reduce absurdity
transcendental argument substance van til's transcendental argument doctrine ontological trinity concerned reciprocal relationships persons godhead each other without reference god's relationship creation aspect god's character necessary possibility rationality
rushdoony writes whole body van til's writings given development concept ontological trinity philosophical implications
ontological trinity important van til because relate philosophical concept concrete universal problem many
van til ontological trinity means god's unity diversity equally basic
contrast non-christian philosophy unity diversity seen ultimately separate each other whole problem knowledge constantly bringing many together
man looks within sees there great variety facts
question comes up once whether there any unity variety whether there principle accordance these many things appear occur
non-christian thought utilized idea supra-mundane existence used supra-mundane existence furnishing unity priori aspect knowledge while maintained posteriori aspect knowledge something furnished universe
pure unity no particularity blank pure particularity no unity chaos
frame says blank chaos meaningless themselves impossible relate another
such unbelieving worldviews reduce unintelligible nonsense
essentially van til's critique secular philosophy influence christian philosophy
karl barth van til also strident opponent theology karl barth opposition led rejection barth's theology many reformed community
despite barth's assertions sought base theology solely 'word god' van til believed barth's thought syncretic nature fundamentally flawed because according van til assumed kantian epistemology van til argued necessarily irrational anti-biblical
influence many recent theologians influenced van til's thought including john frame greg bahnsen rousas john rushdoony francis schaeffer well many current faculty members westminster theological seminary reformed theological seminary other reformed seminaries
