addition umar gave casting vote abdur rahman
abdur rahman offered caliphate ali condition should rule accordance quran example set muhammad precedents established first two caliphs
ali rejected third condition while uthman accepted
according ibn abi al-hadid's comments peak eloquence ali insisted prominence there most electors supported uthman ali reluctantly urged accept
siege uthman main article siege uthman uthman ibn affan expressed generosity toward kin banu abd-shams seemed dominate supposed arrogant mistreatment toward several earliest companions such abu dharr al-ghifari abd-allah ibn mas'ud ammar ibn yasir provoked outrage among groups people

dissatisfaction rule governments appointed restricted provinces outside arabia
uthman's kin especially marwan gained control over noble companions including most members elector council turned against least withdrew their support putting pressure caliph mend ways reduce influence assertive kin
time ali acted restraining influence uthman without directly opposing
several occasions ali disagreed uthman application hudud publicly shown sympathy abu dharr al-ghifari spoken strongly defence ammar ibn yasir

uthman's assassination meant rebels select new caliph
met difficulties since rebels divided several groups comprising muhajirun ansar egyptians kufans basrites
there three candidates ali talhah al-zubayr
first rebels approached ali requesting accept being caliph
muhammad's companions tried persuade ali accept office turned down offer suggesting counsellor instead chief
talhah zubayr other companions also refused rebels' offer caliphate
therefore rebels warned inhabitants medina select caliph within day apply drastic action
order resolve deadlock muslims gathered mosque prophet june 18 656 appoint caliph
initially ali refused accept simply because most vigorous supporters rebels
however notable companions muhammad addition residents medina urged accept offer finally agreed
according abu mekhnaf's narration talhah first prominent companion gave pledge ali other narrations claimed otherwise stating forced give their pledge
also talhah zubayr later claimed supported reluctantly
regardless ali refuted these claims insisting recognised caliph voluntarily
wilferd madelung believes force urge people give their pledge pledged publicly mosque
while overwhelming majority medina's population well many rebels gave their pledge important figures tribes
umayyads kinsmen uthman fled levant remained their houses later refusing ali's legitimacy
sa'ad ibn abi waqqas absent abdullah ibn umar abstained offering allegiance both them assured ali act against
reign caliph domains rashidun caliphate under four caliphs
divided phase relates rashidun caliphate ali during first fitna
strongholds rashidun caliphate ali during first fitna region under control muawiyah during first fitna region under control amr ibn al-as during first fitna since conflicts ali involved perpetuated polemical sectarian historiography biographical material often biased
sources agree profoundly religious man devoted cause islam rule justice accordance quran sunna engaged war against erring muslims matter religious duty
sources abound notices austerity rigorous observance religious duties detachment worldly goods
thus authors pointed out lacked political skill flexibility
ali inherited rashidun caliphate—which extended egypt west iranian highlands east—while situation hejaz other provinces eve election unsettled
soon after ali became caliph dismissed provincial governors appointed uthman replacing them trusted aides
acted against counsel mughira ibn shu'ba ibn abbas advised proceed governing cautiously

muawiyah kinsman uthman governor levant refused submit ali's orders governor

advised populace behave true muslims warning tolerate no sedition those found guilty subversive activities dealt harshly
ali recovered land granted uthman swore recover anything elites acquired before election
ali opposed centralisation capital control over provincial revenues favouring equal distribution taxes booty amongst muslim citizens distributed entire revenue treasury among them
ali refrained nepotism including brother aqeel ibn abu talib

name ali islamic calligraphy
ali succeeded forming broad coalition especially after battle camel
policy equal distribution taxes booty gained support muhammad's companions especially ansar subordinated quraysh leadership after muhammad traditional tribal leaders qurra quran reciters sought pious islamic leadership
successful formation diverse coalition seems due ali's charismatic character
diverse coalition became known shi'a ali meaning party faction ali
however according shia well non-shia reports majority those supported ali after election caliph shia politically religiously
although time there many counted political shia few them believed ali's religious leadership
first fitna vte first islamic civil war camel siffin nahrawan see also first fitna a'isha talhah al-zubayr umayyads especially muawiyah marwan wanted ali punish rioters killed uthman
wanted ali arrest uthman ibn affan's killer fight muawiyah
encamped close basra
talks lasted many days subsequent heated exchange protests during parley turned words blows leading loss life both sides
confusion battle camel started 656 ali emerged victorious
however historians believe used issue seek their political ambitions because found ali's caliphate against their own benefit
other hand rebels maintained uthman justly killed governing according quran sunnah hence no vengeance invoked
historians disagree ali's position
say caliphate gift rebels ali enough force control punish them while others say ali accepted rebels' argument least consider uthman just ruler
under such circumstances schism took place led first civil war muslim history
muslims known uthmanis considered uthman rightful just caliph till end unlawfully killed
others known party ali believed uthman fallen error forfeited caliphate lawfully executed refusal mend ways step down thus ali just true imam opponents infidels
important note position ali himself
civil war created permanent divisions within muslim community regarding legitimate right occupy caliphate
first fitna 656–661 followed assassination uthman continued during caliphate ali ended muawiyah's assumption caliphate
civil war often called fitna regretted end early unity islamic ummah nation
ali appointed 'abd allah ibn al'-abbas governor basra moved capital kufa muslim garrison city iraq
following roman-persian wars byzantine–sasanian wars lasted hundreds years there deep rooted differences iraq formally under persian sassanid empire syria formally under byzantine empire
iraqis wanted capital newly established islamic state kufa bring revenues their area oppose syria
convinced ali come kufa establish capital kufa iraq
later muawiyah governor levant cousin uthman refused ali's demands allegiance
ali opened negotiations hoping regain allegiance muawiyah insisted levant autonomy under rule
muawiyah replied mobilising levantine supporters refusing pay homage ali pretext contingent participated election
ali then moved armies north two armies encamped themselves siffin hundred days most time being spent negotiations
although ali exchanged several letters muawiyah unable dismiss latter nor persuade pledge allegiance
skirmishes parties led battle siffin 657
after week combat followed violent battle known laylat al-harir night clamour muawiyah's army point being routed amr ibn al-aas advised muawiyah soldiers hoist mus'haf either parchments inscribed verses quran complete copies their spearheads order cause disagreement confusion ali's army
ali saw through stratagem minority wanted pursue fight
two armies finally agreed settle matter should caliph arbitration
refusal largest bloc ali's army fight decisive factor acceptance arbitration
question whether arbiter represent ali kufans caused further split ali's army
ash'ath ibn qays others rejected ali's nominees 'abd allah ibn 'abbas malik al-ashtar insisted abu musa ash'ari neutrality
finally ali urged accept abu musa
amr ibn al-as appointed muawiyah arbitrator
seven months later two arbitrators met adhruh 10 miles north west maan jordan february 658
amr ibn al-as convinced abu musa ash'ari both ali muawiyah should step down new caliph elected
ali supporters stunned decision lowered caliph status rebellious muawiyah
ali therefore outwitted muawiyah amr ibn al-as
arbitrators assembled daumet-ul-jandal series daily meetings arranged them discuss matters hand
time arrived taking decision caliphate amr bin al-a'as convinced abu musa al-ashari entertaining opinion should deprive both ali muawiya caliphate give muslims right elect caliph
abu musa al-ashari also decided act accordingly
according poonawala seems arbiters other eminent persons exclusion ali’s representatives met january 659 discuss selection new caliph
amr supported muawiyah while abu musa preferred son-in-law abdullah ibn umar latter refused stand election default unanimity
abu musa then proposed amr agreed depose both ali muawiyah submit selection new caliph shura
public declaration followed abu musa observed part agreement amr declared ali deposed confirmed muawiya caliph
ali refused accept verdict stepping down election held found himself technically breach pledge abide arbitration
ali protested stating contrary qur'an sunnah hence binding
then tried organise new army ansar remnants qurra led malik ashtar few their clansmen remained loyal
put ali weak position even amongst own supporters
arbitration resulted dissolution ali's coalition opined muawiyah's intention
most vociferous opponents ali's camp very same people forced ali ceasefire
broke away ali's force rallying under slogan arbitration belongs god alone
group came known kharijites those leave
considered everyone their enemy
659 ali's forces kharijites met battle nahrawan
qurra then became known kharijites
kharijites then started killing ali's supporters other muslims
considered anyone part their group unbeliever
659 ali's forces finally moved against kharijites finally met battle nahrawan
although ali won battle huge margin constant conflict begun affect standing
while dealing iraqis ali found hard build disciplined army effective state institutions
also spent lot time fighting kharijites
result ali found hard expand state eastern front
same time unrest brewing egypt
governor egypt qais recalled ali replaced muhammad ibn abi bakr brother aisha son islam's first caliph abu bakr
muawiyah allowed 'amr ibn al-'as conquer egypt 'amr successfully
amr first taken egypt eighteen years earlier romans dismissed uthman
muhammad ibn abi bakr no popular support egypt managed get together 2000 men dispersed without fight
following years muawiyah's army occupied many cities iraq ali's governors prevent people support fight them
muawiyah overpowered egypt hijaz yemen other areas
last year ali's caliphate mood kufa basra changed favour people became disillusioned muawiyah's reign policies
however people's attitude toward ali differed deeply
just small minority them believed ali best muslim after muhammad entitled rule them while majority supported due their distrust opposition muawiyah
grand view ali mausoleum najaf iraq policies shows ali's policies ideas governing instruction malik al-ashtar appointed governor egypt
instruction considered many muslims even non-muslims ideal constitution islamic governance involved detailed description duties rights ruler various functionaries state main classes society time
[need quotation verify] ali instruction malik al-ashtar infuse your heart mercy love kindness your subjects
face them voracious animal counting them easy prey two kinds either your brothers religion your equals creation
error catches them unaware deficiencies overcome them evil deeds committed them intentionally mistake
grant them your pardon your forgiveness same extent you hope god will grant you pardon forgiveness
you above them appointed you above you god above appointed you
god sought you fulfillment their requirements trying you them
