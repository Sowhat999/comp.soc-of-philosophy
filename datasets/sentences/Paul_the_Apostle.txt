two main passages explain these household duties paul's letters ephesians 522-65 colossians 318-41
underlying household code also reflected four additional pauline letters peter timothy 21 ff
31 ff
517 ff
61 f
titus 21-10 peter 213-39
biblical scholars typically treated haustafel ephesians resource debate over role women ministry home
margaret mac donald argues haustafel particularly appears ephesians aimed reducing tension community members outsiders

1434-36 women making any sound during worship paul's intemperate outburst women should silent churches
women fact played very significant part paul's missionary endeavors became partner ministry couple priscilla aquila specifically named seven times new testament—always their couple name never individually
seven times named new testament priscilla's name appears first five those instances suggesting scholars she head family unit
lived worked traveled apostle paul becoming honored much-loved friends coworkers christ jesus

another well-known passage addresses topic obliquely timothy 18-11
since nineteenth century however scholars concluded first timothy along second timothy titus original paul rather unknown christian writing paul's name time late-first-to-mid-2 nd century
influence christianity main article pauline christianity paul's influence christian thinking arguably significant any other new testament author
paul declared christ end law exalted christian church body christ depicted world outside church under judgment
paul's writings include earliest reference lord's supper rite traditionally identified christian communion eucharist
east church fathers attributed element election romans 9 divine foreknowledge
themes predestination found western christianity appear eastern theology
augustine's foundational work gospel gift grace morality life spirit predestination original sin derives paul especially romans
modern theology see also pauline christianity jesuism commentary epistle romans ger
römerbrief particularly thoroughly re-written second edition 1922 karl barth argued god revealed cross jesus challenges overthrows any attempt ally god human cultures achievements possessions
theologians believe work most important theological treatise since friedrich schleiermacher's religion speeches cultured despisers
[citation needed] addition many questions true origins paul's teachings posed historical figures noted above modern theologians also hold teachings paul differ markedly those jesus found gospels
barrie wilson states paul differs jesus terms origin message teachings practices
even gone far claim due these apparent differences teachings paul actually no less second founder christianity jesus being first
robert m

eastern tradition general western humanists interpret reference election romans 9 reflecting divine foreknowledge
church tradition various christian writers suggested details paul's life
clement letter written roman bishop clement rome around year 90 reports paul reason jealousy strife paul example pointed out prize patient endurance
after seven times bonds driven exile stoned preached east west won noble renown reward faith having taught righteousness unto whole world having reached farthest bounds west borne testimony before rulers departed world went unto holy place having found notable pattern patient endurance
commenting passage raymond brown writes while does explicitly say paul martyred rome such martyrdom most reasonable interpretation
eusebius caesarea 4 th century states paul beheaded reign roman emperor nero
event dated either year 64 rome devastated fire few years later 67
according tradition church san paolo alle tre fontane marks place paul's execution
roman catholic liturgical solemnity peter paul celebrated june 29 commemorates martyrdom reflects tradition preserved eusebius peter paul martyred same time
roman liturgical calendar following day now remembers christians martyred these early persecutions formerly june 30 feast day st

bede ecclesiastical history writes pope vitalian 665 gave paul's relics including cross made prison chains crypts lucina king oswy northumbria northern britain
paul considered patron saint london
feast conversion saint paul celebrated january 25
islamic view muslims long believed paul purposefully corrupted original revealed teachings jesus through introduction such elements paganism making christianity theology cross introducing original sin need redemption
sunni polemics paul plays same role deliberately corrupting early teachings jesus later jew abdullah ibn saba' play seeking destroy message islam within introducing proto-shi'ite beliefs
among those supported view scholars ibn taymiyyah believed while paul ultimately succeeded ibn saba failed ibn hazm claimed jews even admitted paul's sinister purpose
jewish views main article paul apostle judaism see also messianic judaism jewish interest paul recent phenomenon

literary analysis statue paul holding scroll symbolising scriptures sword symbolising martyrdom writing styles british jewish scholar hyam maccoby contended paul described book acts view paul gleaned own writings very different people
difficulties noted account life
paul described book acts much interested factual history less theology ideas such justification faith absent references spirit according maccoby
also pointed out there no references john baptist pauline epistles although paul mentions several times book acts
others objected language speeches too lukan style reflect anyone else's words
moreover george shillington writes author acts most likely created speeches accordingly bear literary theological marks
conversely howard marshall writes speeches entirely inventions author while may accurate word-for-word author nevertheless records general idea them
baur 1792–1860 professor theology tübingen germany first scholar critique acts pauline epistles founder tübingen school theology argued paul apostle gentiles violent opposition original 12 apostles
baur considers acts apostles late unreliable
debate continued ever since adolf deissmann 1866–1937 richard reitzenstein 1861–1931 emphasising paul's greek inheritance albert schweitzer stressing dependence judaism
other views saint paul byzantine ivory relief 6 th early 7 th century musée de cluny second possibly late first century gnosticism competing religious tradition christianity shared elements theology
elaine pagels professor religion princeton university authority gnosticism declined judge her book gnostic paul whether paul actually gnostic
instead she concentrated how gnostics interpreted paul's letters how evidence gnostic sources may challenge assumption paul letters combat gnostic opponents repudiate their statement possess secret wisdom
professor robert eisenman california state university long beach argues paul member family herod great
eisenman makes connection paul individual identified josephus saulus kinsman agrippa
another oft-cited element case paul member herod's family found romans 1611 paul writes greet herodion my kinsman
according timo eskola early christian theology discourse influenced jewish merkabah tradition
similarly alan segal daniel boyarin regard paul's accounts conversion experience ascent heavens earliest first person accounts merkabah mystic jewish christian literature
conversely timothy churchill argued paul's damascus road encounter does fit pattern merkabah
among critics paul apostle thomas jefferson deist paul first corrupter doctrines jesus
christian anarchists such leo tolstoy ammon hennacy take similar view
powell argues paul epistles made use many ideas greek philosopher plato sometimes even using same metaphors language
example phaedrus plato socrates saying heavenly ideals perceived though through glass dimly paul's language closely mirrors phrase corinthians 13

physical appearance new testament offers little any information physical appearance paul several descriptions found apocryphal texts
acts paul described man small stature bald head crooked legs good state body eyebrows meeting nose somewhat hooked latin version acts paul thecla added red florid face
history contending saint paul countenance actually described ruddy ruddiness skin pomegranate acts saint peter confirms paul bald shining head red hair
summarised barnes chrysostom records paul's stature low body crooked head bald
lucian philopatris describes paul corpore erat parvo small contracto contracted incurvo crooked tricubitali three cubits four feet six while nicephorus claims paul little man crooked almost bent like bow pale countenance long wrinkled bald head
pseudo-chrysostom echoes lucian's height paul referring man three cubits
paul himself admits having abnormally born perhaps suggesting kind deformity such being crooked hunch-backed tormented
