career after graduation elected fellowship gonville caius college worked hopkins' laboratory university department biochemistry specialising embryology morphogenesis
three-volume work chemical embryology published 1931 includes history embryology egyptian times up early 19 th century including quotations most european languages
terry lecture 1936 published cambridge university press association yale university press under title order life
1939 produced massive work morphogenesis harvard reviewer claimed will go down history science joseph needham's magnum opus little knowing come later
although career biochemist academic well established career developed unanticipated directions during after world war ii
three chinese scientists came cambridge graduate study 1937 lu gwei-djen chinese 鲁桂珍 pinyin lu gui-zhen wang ying-lai 王應睞 shen shih-chang 沈詩章 under needham's tutelage
lu 1904–91 daughter nanjingese pharmacist taught needham chinese igniting interest china's ancient technological scientific past
then pursued mastered study classical chinese privately gustav haloun
under royal society's direction needham director sino-british science co-operation office chongqing 1942 1946
during time made several long journeys through war-torn china many smaller ones visiting scientific educational establishments obtaining them much needed supplies
longest trip late 1943 ended far west gansu caves dunhuang end great wall earliest dated printed book - copy diamond sutra - found
other long trip reached fuzhou east coast returning across xiang river just two days before japanese blew up bridge hengyang cut off part china
1944 visited yunnan attempt reach burmese border
everywhere went purchased given old historical scientific books shipped back britain through diplomatic channels
form foundation later research
got know zhou enlai met numerous chinese scholars including painter wu zuoren 吳作人 meteorologist zhu kezhen later sent crates books cambridge including 2000 volumes gujin tushu jicheng encyclopaedia comprehensive record china's past
return europe asked julian huxley become first head natural sciences section unesco paris france
fact needham insisted science should included organisation's mandate earlier planning meeting
after two years suspicions americans over scientific co-operation communists intensified needham resigned 1948 returned gonville caius college resumed fellowship rooms soon filled books
devoted energy history chinese science until retirement 1990 even though continued teach biochemistry until 1966
needham's reputation recovered korean affair see below such 1959 elected president fellows caius college 1965 became master head college post held until 76
science civilisation china main article science civilisation china 1948 needham proposed project cambridge university press book science civilisation china
within weeks being accepted project grown seven volumes expanded ever since
initial collaborator historian wang ling 王玲 whom met lizhuang obtained position trinity
first years devoted compiling list every mechanical invention abstract idea made conceived china
these included cast iron ploughshare stirrup gunpowder printing magnetic compass clockwork escapements most thought time western inventions
first volume eventually appeared 1954
publication received widespread acclaim increased lyrical further volumes appeared
fifteen volumes himself regular production further volumes continued after death 1995
later volume iii divided 27 volumes now published

project still proceeding under guidance publications board needham research institute chaired christopher cullen
needham question see also high level equilibrium trap sprouts capitalism great divergence needham's grand question also known needham question why china india overtaken west science technology despite their earlier successes? needham's words “why modern science mathematization hypotheses nature implications advanced technology take meteoric rise west time galileo [but] developed chinese civilisation indian civilisation?” gunpowder magnetic compass paper printing francis bacon considered three most important inventions facilitating west's transformation dark ages modern world invented china
needham's works attribute significant weight impact confucianism taoism pace chinese scientific discovery emphasises diffusionist approach chinese science opposed perceived independent inventiveness western world
needham thought notion chinese script inhibited scientific thought grossly overrated
own research revealed steady accumulation scientific results throughout chinese history
final volume suggests continuing general scientific progress manifested itself traditional chinese society violently overtaken exponential growth modern science after renaissance europe
china homeostatic never stagnant
nathan sivin needham's collaborators while agreeing needham's achievement monumental suggested needham question counterfactual hypothesis conducive useful answer striking question why didn't chinese beat europeans scientific revolution? happens few questions people often ask public places why something didn't happen history
analogous question why your name appear page 3 today's newspaper
there several hypotheses attempting explain needham question
yingqui liu chunjiang liu argued issue rested lack property rights those rights obtainable through favour emperor
protection incomplete emperor rescind those rights anytime
science technology subjugated needs feudal royal family any new discoveries sequestered government use
government took steps control interfere private enterprises manipulating prices engaging bribery
each revolution china redistributed property rights under same feudal system
land property reallocated first foremost royal family new dynasty up until late qing dynasty 1644–1911 fiefdom land taken over warlords merchants
these limited property rights constrained potential scientific innovations
chinese empire enacted totalitarian control able because great size
there smaller independent states no choice comply control
afford isolate themselves
chinese believed well being state their primary motive economic activity individual initiatives shunned
there regulations press clothing construction music birth rates trade
chinese state controlled aspects life severely limiting any incentives innovate better one's self
ingenuity inventiveness chinese no doubt enriched china further probably brought threshold modern industry stifling state control
state kills technological progress china
according justin lin china make shift experience-based technological invention process experiment-based innovation process
experience-based process depended size population while new technologies come through trials errors peasants artisans experiment-based processes surpasses experience-based processes yielding new technology
progress experimentation following logic scientific method occur much faster rate because inventor perform many trials during same production period under controlled environment
results experimentation dependent stock scientific knowledge while results experience-based processes tied directly size population hence experiment-based innovation processes higher likelihood producing better technology human capital grows
china twice population europe until 13 th century higher probability creating new technologies
after 14 th century china's population grew exponentially progress innovation saw diminishing returns
europe smaller population began integrate science technology arose scientific revolution 17 th century
scientific revolution gave europe comparative advantage developing technology modern times
lin blamed institutions china preventing adoption experiment-based methodology
sociopolitical institution inhibited intellectual creativity importantly diverted creativity away scientific endeavours
totalitarian control state chinese empire inhibited public dispute competition growth modern science while clusters independent european nations favourable competition scientific development
addition chinese incentives acquire human capital necessary modern scientific experimentation
civil service deemed most rewarding honourable work pre-modern china
gifted incentives pursue route move up social status ladder opposed pursuing scientific endeavours
evaluations critiques needham's work criticised scholars assert strong inclination exaggerate chinese technological achievements excessive propensity assume chinese origin wide range objects work covered
pierre-yves manguin writes instance j needham's 1971 monumental work chinese nautics offers far most scholarly synthesis subjects chinese shipbuilding navigation
propensity view chinese initiators things constant references superiority chinese over rest world's techniques does times detract argument
another vein criticism andre gunder frank's re-orient argues despite needham's contributions field chinese technological history still struggled break free preconceived notions european exceptionalism
re-orient criticizes needham eurocentric assumptions borrowed marx presupposition needham's famous grand question science uniquely western phenomenon
frank observes alas also originally needham's marxist weberian point departure
needham found evidence science technology china struggled liberate himself eurocentric original sin inherited directly marx cohen also observes
needham never quite succeeded perhaps because concentration china prevented sufficiently revising still ethnocentric view europe itself
barrett asserts woman discovered printing needham unduly critical buddhism describing having 'tragically played part strangling growth chinese science' needham readily conceded conversation few years later
barrett also criticizes needham's favoritism uncritical evaluation taoism chinese technological history tendency — entirely justified light recent research — think well taoism because saw playing part found elsewhere chinese civilization
mainstream school thinking bureaucratic chinese elite 'confucianism' another problematic term vocabulary seemed less interested science technology 'turned face away nature
ironically dynasty apparently turned away printing 706 till demise 907 taoist any chinese history though perhaps 'state taoism' seemed corrupt inauthentic business needham
referring needham's work sinologist daiwie fu essay mengxi bitan's world marginalities 'south-pointing needles' fragment translation vs
contextual tradition argues contextual translations instead fragmented ones criticising faults needham particular
political involvement needham's political views unorthodox lifestyle controversial
left-wing stance based idiosyncratic form christian socialism after 1949 sympathy chinese culture extended new government
during stay china needham asked analyse cattle-cakes communists claimed scattered american aircraft south china end world war ii found impregnated anthrax
during korean war further accusations made americans used biological warfare
zhou enlai coordinated international campaign enlist needham study commission tacitly offering access materials contacts china needed then early research
needham agreed inspector north korea report supported allegations
after post-cold war revelations soviets assisted chinese setting up false scenarios needham's biographer simon winchester commented needham intellectually love communism yet communist spymasters agents turned out pitilessly duped
needham blacklisted us government until well 1970 s
1965 derek bryan retired diplomat whom first met china needham established society anglo-chinese understanding years provided way british visit people's republic china
visit china 1964 met zhou enlai visit 1972 deeply depressed changes under cultural revolution
personal life needham married biochemist dorothy moyle 1896–1987 1924 became first husband wife both elected fellows royal society
simon winchester notes younger days needham avid gymnosophist attracted pretty women
lu gwei-djen met 1937 fell deeply love dorothy accepted
