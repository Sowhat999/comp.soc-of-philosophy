least cost theory leaning heavily work developed relatively unknown wilhelm launhardt alfred weber formulated least cost theory industrial location tries explain predict locational pattern industry macro-scale
emphasizes firms seek site minimum transport labor cost
point locating industry minimizes costs transportation labor requires analysis three factors material index point optimal transportation based costs distance material index ratio weights intermediate products raw materials finished product
scenario weight final product less weight raw material going making product—the weight losing industry
example copper industry very expensive haul raw materials market processing manufacturing occurs near raw materials
besides mining other primary activities extractive industries considered material oriented timber mills furniture manufacture most agricultural activities etc
often located rural areas these businesses may employ most local population
leave locale area loses economic base
other final product equally heavy material index equal raw materials require transport
usually case ubiquitous raw material such water being incorporated product
called weight-gaining industry
type industry tends build up near market raw material source called foot-loose industry
cotton industry prominent example weight-gaining raw material
industries like heavy chemical industry weight raw materials less weight finished product
these industries grow up near market
weber's point optimal transportation generalization fermat point problem
simplest form fermat problem consists locating point respect three points c such way sum distances each three other points minimized
weber triangle problem consists locating point respect three points c such way sum transportation costs each three other points minimized
1971 luc-normand tellier found first direct non iterative numerical solution fermat weber triangle problems
long before von thünen’s contributions go back 1818 fermat point problem seen very beginning space economy
formulated famous french mathematician pierre de fermat before 1640
weber triangle problem generalization fermat triangle problem first formulated thomas simpson 1750 popularized alfred weber 1909
1985 book entitled économie spatiale rationalité économique de l'espace habité tellier formulated all-new problem called “attraction-repulsion problem” constitutes generalization both fermat weber problems
simplest version attraction-repulsion problem consists locating point respect three points a1 a2 r such way attractive forces exerted points a1 a2 repulsive force exerted point r cancel each other out
same book tellier solved problem first time triangle case reinterpreted spatial economics theory especially theory land rent light concepts attractive repulsive forces stemming attraction-repulsion problem
problem later further analyzed mathematicians like chen hansen jaumard tuy 1992 jalal krarup 2003
attraction-repulsion problem seen ottaviano thisse 2005 prelude new economic geography developed 1990 s earned paul krugman nobel memorial prize economic sciences 2008
labor labor distortion sources lower cost labor may justify greater transport distances become primary determinant production
unskilled labor industries such garment industry require cheap unskilled laborers complete activities mechanized
often termed ubiquitous meaning found everywhere
pull due low wages little unionization young employees
skilled labor high tech firms such those located silicon valley require exceptionally skilled professionals
skilled labor often difficult find mobile unskilled labor
agglomeration deglomeration agglomeration phenomenon spatial clustering concentration firms relatively small area
clustering linkages allow individual firms enjoy both internal external economies
auxiliary industries specialized machines services used occasionally larger firms tend located agglomeration areas just lower costs serve bigger populations
deglomeration occurs companies services leave because diseconomies industries’ excessive concentration
firms achieve economies increasing their scale industrial activities benefit agglomeration
however after reaching optimal size local facilities may become over-taxed lead offset initial advantages increase pc
then force agglomeration may eventually replaced other forces promote deglomeration
globalization similarly industrial activity considered secondary economic activity also discussed manufacturing
industrial activity broken down further include following activities processing creation intermediate parts final assembly
today multinational corporations three activities listed above may occur outside mdcs
weber's theory explain causes current movement yet such discussion come weber himself
weber found industrial activity least expensive produce
least cost location then implies marketing product least cost consumer much like retailers attempt obtain large market shares today
economically explained way make profit creating cheapest product consumer market leads greater volume sales hence greater profits
therefore companies take time locate cheapest inputs largest markets succeed since their product costs produce costs consumer
theory five assumptions
first assumption known isotropic plain assumption
means model operative single country uniform topography climate technology economic system
second assumption finished product considered time product shipped single market
third assumption raw materials fixed certain locations market also known fixed location
fourth assumption labor fixed geographically available unlimited quantities any production site selected
final assumption transport costs direct function weight item distance shipped
use theory created locational triangle
triangle used market two sources material
illustrated manufacturing utilizes pure materials will never tie processing location material site
also industries utilizing high weight loss materials will tend pulled toward material source opposed market
furthermore many industries will select intermediate location market material
last generalization considered wrong because never takes account terminal costs therefore considered biased toward intermediate locations
further explore location firms weber also created two concepts
first isotim line equal transport cost any product material
second isodapane line total transport costs
isodapane found adding isotims location
reason using isodapanes systematically introduce labor component weber’s locational theory
weber received much criticism
weber effectively realistically take account geographic variation market demand considered locational factor paramount influence
also treatment transport recognize these costs proportional distance weight intermediate locations necessitate added terminal charges
labor available unlimited quantity any location usually quite mobile through migration
plus most manufacturing plants obtain large number material inputs produce wide range products many diverse markets theory doesn’t easily apply
furthermore underestimated effect agglomeration
