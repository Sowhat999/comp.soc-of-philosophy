grayling opened september
work evolutionary biology further information gene-centred view evolution university texas austin march 2008 scientific works dawkins best known popularisation gene principal unit selection evolution view most clearly set out books selfish gene 1976 notes life evolves differential survival replicating entities
extended phenotype 1982 describes natural selection process whereby replicators out-propagate each other
introduces wider audience concept presented 1977 phenotypic effects gene necessarily limited organism's body stretch far environment including bodies other organisms
dawkins consistently sceptical non-adaptive processes evolution such spandrels described gould lewontin selection levels above gene
particularly sceptical practical possibility importance group selection basis understanding altruism
169–172 behaviour appears first evolutionary paradox since helping others costs precious resources decreases one's own fitness
previously many interpreted aspect group selection individuals doing best survival population species whole
british evolutionary biologist w
hamilton used gene-centred view explain altruism terms inclusive fitness kin selection—that individuals behave altruistically toward their close relatives share many their own genes
[a] similarly robert trivers thinking terms gene-centred model developed theory reciprocal altruism whereby organism provides benefit another expectation future reciprocation
dawkins popularised these ideas selfish gene developed them own work
dawkins also strongly critical gaia hypothesis independent scientist james lovelock
june highly critical fellow biologist e
wilson's book social conquest earth
dawkins's book greatest show earth evidence evolution expounds evidence biological evolution coincided darwin's bicentennial year
critics dawkins's biological approach suggest taking gene unit selection single event individual either succeeds fails reproduce misleading gene better described say unit evolution long-term changes allele frequencies population
selfish gene dawkins explains using george c
williams's definition gene segregates recombines appreciable frequency
another common objection gene cannot survive alone must cooperate other genes build individual therefore gene cannot independent unit
extended phenotype dawkins suggests individual gene's viewpoint other genes part environment adapted
advocates higher levels selection such richard lewontin david sloan wilson elliott sober suggest there many phenomena including altruism gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain
philosopher mary midgley whom dawkins clashed print concerning selfish gene criticised gene selection memetics sociobiology being excessively reductionist she suggested popularity dawkins's work due factors zeitgeist such increased individualism thatcher/reagan decades
set controversies over mechanisms interpretation evolution called 'the darwin wars' faction often named after dawkins while other faction named after american palaeontologist stephen jay gould reflecting pre-eminence each populariser pertinent ideas
particular dawkins gould prominent commentators controversy over sociobiology evolutionary psychology dawkins generally approving gould generally being critical
typical example dawkins's position scathing review our genes steven rose leon j
kamin richard c
two other thinkers often considered allied dawkins subject steven pinker daniel dennett dennett promoted gene-centred view evolution defended reductionism biology
despite their academic disagreements dawkins gould hostile personal relationship dawkins dedicated large portion 2003 book devil's chaplain posthumously gould died previous year
fathering meme main article meme book selfish gene dawkins coined word meme behavioural equivalent gene way encourage readers think how darwinian principles might extended beyond realm genes
intended extension replicators argument took life own hands other authors such daniel dennett susan blackmore
these popularisations then led emergence memetics field dawkins distanced himself
dawkins's meme refers any cultural entity observer might consider replicator certain idea set ideas
hypothesised people view many cultural entities capable such replication generally through communication contact humans evolved efficient although perfect copiers information behaviour
because memes copied perfectly might become refined combined otherwise modified other ideas results new memes may themselves prove less efficient replicators their predecessors thus providing framework hypothesis cultural evolution based memes notion analogous theory biological evolution based genes
although dawkins invented term meme claimed idea entirely novel there other expressions similar ideas past
instance john laurent suggested term may derived work little-known german biologist richard semon
1904 semon published die mneme appeared english 1924 mneme
book discusses cultural transmission experiences insights parallel those dawkins
laurent also found term mneme used maurice maeterlinck's life white ant 1926 highlighted similarities dawkins's concept
james gleick describes dawkins's concept meme most famous memorable invention far influential selfish genes later proselytising against religiosity

5 dawkins sees education consciousness-raising primary tools opposing considers religious dogma indoctrination
these tools include fight against certain stereotypes adopted term bright way associating positive public connotations those possess naturalistic worldview
given support idea free thinking school indoctrinate children atheism any religion instead teach children critical open-minded
inspired consciousness-raising successes feminists arousing widespread embarrassment routine use instead she dawkins similarly suggests phrases such catholic child muslim child should considered socially absurd instance marxist child believes children should classified based their parents' ideological religious beliefs
ariane sherine atheist bus campaign launch london dawkins suggests atheists should proud apologetic stressing atheism evidence healthy independent mind

watson steven weinberg defended perceived stridency dawkins's stance towards religion praised work others including nobel prize-winning theoretical physicist peter higgs astrophysicist martin rees philosopher science michael ruse literary critic terry eagleton theologian alister mc grath criticised dawkins various grounds including assertion work simply serves atheist counterpart religious fundamentalism rather productive critique fundamentally misapprehended foundations theological positions claims refute
rees higgs particular both rejected dawkins's confrontational stance towards religion narrow embarrassing higgs going far equate dawkins religious fundamentalists criticises
atheist philosopher john gray denounced dawkins anti-religious missionary whose assertions no sense novel original suggesting transfixed wonderment workings own mind dawkins misses much importance human beings
gray also criticised dawkins's perceived allegiance darwin stating science darwin method inquiry enabled edge tentatively humbly toward truth dawkins science unquestioned view world

described young earth creationist view earth few thousand years old preposterous mind-shrinking falsehood 1986 book blind watchmaker contains sustained critique argument design important creationist argument
book dawkins argues against watchmaker analogy made famous 18 th-century english theologian william paley via book natural theology paley argues just watch too complicated too functional sprung existence merely accident too must living things—with their far greater complexity—be purposefully designed
dawkins shares view generally held scientists natural selection sufficient explain apparent functionality non-random complexity biological world play role watchmaker nature albeit automatic nonintelligent blind watchmaker
