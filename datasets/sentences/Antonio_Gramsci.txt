thought gramsci most important marxist thinkers 20 th century particularly key thinker development western marxism
30 notebooks 3000 pages history analysis during imprisonment
these writings known prison notebooks contain gramsci's tracing italian history nationalism well ideas marxist theory critical theory educational theory associated name such cultural hegemony means maintaining legitimising capitalist state need popular workers' education encourage development intellectuals working class analysis modern capitalist state distinguishes political society dominates directly coercively civil society leadership constituted means consent absolute historicism critique economic determinism opposes fatalistic interpretations marxism critique pre-marxist philosophical materialism
hegemony details topic see cultural hegemony
hegemony term previously used marxists such vladimir ilyich lenin denote political leadership working-class democratic revolution
15–17 gramsci greatly expanded concept developing acute analysis how ruling capitalist class bourgeoisie establishes maintains control
20 orthodox marxism predicted socialist revolution inevitable capitalist societies
early 20 th century no such revolution occurred most advanced nations
capitalism seemed even entrenched ever
capitalism gramsci suggested maintained control just through violence political economic coercion also through ideology
bourgeoisie developed hegemonic culture propagated own values norms became common sense values
people working-class other classes identified their own good good bourgeoisie helped maintain status quo rather revolting
counter notion bourgeois values represented natural normal values society working class needed develop culture own
lenin held culture ancillary political objectives gramsci fundamental attainment power cultural hegemony achieved first
gramsci's view class cannot dominate modern conditions merely advancing own narrow economic interests neither dominate purely through force coercion
rather must exert intellectual moral leadership make alliances compromises variety forces
gramsci calls union social forces historic bloc taking term georges sorel
bloc forms basis consent certain social order produces re-produces hegemony dominant class through nexus institutions social relations ideas
way gramsci's theory emphasized importance political ideological superstructure both maintaining fracturing relations economic base
gramsci stated bourgeois cultural values tied folklore popular culture religion therefore much analysis hegemonic culture aimed these
also impressed influence roman catholicism care church taken prevent excessive gap developing religion learned less educated
gramsci saw marxism marriage purely intellectual critique religion found renaissance humanism elements reformation appealed masses
gramsci marxism supersede religion met people's spiritual needs people think expression their own experience
gramsci hegemonic dominance ultimately relied consented coercion crisis authority masks consent slip away revealing fist force
[citation needed] intellectuals education gramsci gave much thought role intellectuals society
famously stated men intellectuals intellectual rational faculties men social function intellectuals
saw modern intellectuals talkers practically-minded directors organisers produced hegemony through ideological apparatuses such education media
furthermore distinguished traditional intelligentsia sees itself wrongly class apart society thinking groups every class produces own ranks organically
such organic intellectuals simply describe social life accordance scientific rules instead articulate through language culture feelings experiences masses express themselves
need create working-class culture relates gramsci's call kind education develop working-class intellectuals whose task introduce marxist ideology without proletariat renovate existing intellectual activity masses make critical status quo
ideas education system purpose correspond notion critical pedagogy popular education theorized practised later decades paulo freire brazil much common thought frantz fanon
reason partisans adult popular education consider gramsci important voice day
state civil society gramsci's theory hegemony tied conception capitalist state
gramsci does understand 'state' narrow sense government
instead divides 'political society' police army legal system etc
arena political institutions legal constitutional control 'civil society' family education system trade unions etc
commonly seen 'private' 'non-state' sphere mediating state economy
stresses however division purely conceptual two reality often overlap
capitalist state gramsci claims rules through force plus consent political society realm force civil society realm consent
gramsci proffers under modern capitalism bourgeoisie maintain economic control allowing certain demands made trade unions mass political parties within civil society met political sphere
thus bourgeoisie engages passive revolution going beyond immediate economic interests allowing forms hegemony change
gramsci posits movements such reformism fascism well 'scientific management' assembly line methods frederick taylor henry ford respectively examples
drawing machiavelli argues 'the modern prince' revolutionary party force will allow working-class develop organic intellectuals alternative hegemony within civil society
gramsci complex nature modern civil society means 'war position' carried out revolutionaries through political agitation trade unions advancement proletarian culture other ways create opposing civil society necessary alongside 'war manoeuvre' direct revolution order successful revolution without danger counter-revolution degeneration
despite claim lines two may blurred gramsci rejects state-worship results identifying political society civil society done jacobins fascists
believes proletariat's historical task create 'regulated society' defines 'withering away state' full development civil society's ability regulate itself
historicism gramsci like early marx emphatic proponent historicism
gramsci's view meaning derives relation human practical activity praxis objective historical social processes part
ideas cannot understood outside their social historical context apart their function origin
concepts organise our knowledge world derive primarily our relation things objective reality rather social economic marx relations bearers those concepts
result there no such thing unchanging human nature
furthermore philosophy science reflect reality independent man
rather theory true any given historical situation expresses real developmental trend situation
majority marxists truth truth no matter known scientific knowledge included marxism accumulated historically advance truth everyday sense
view marxism marxist theory history economics belong illusory realm superstructure because science
contrast gramsci believed marxism true socially pragmatic sense articulating class consciousness proletariat marxism expressed truth times better any other theory
anti-scientistic anti-positivist stance indebted influence benedetto croce
however should underlined gramsci's absolute historicism broke croce's tendency secure metaphysical synthesis historical destiny
though gramsci repudiates charge historical account truth criticised form relativism
critique economism notable pre-prison article entitled revolution against das kapital gramsci october revolution russia invalidated idea socialist revolution await full development capitalist forces production
reflected view marxism determinist philosophy
principle causal primacy forces production misconception marxism
both economic changes cultural changes expressions basic historical process difficult say sphere primacy over other
belief widespread within workers' movement earliest years inevitably triumph due historical laws gramsci's view product historical circumstances oppressed class restricted mainly defensive action
fatalistic doctrine abandoned hindrance once working-class became able take initiative
because marxism philosophy praxis cannot rely unseen historical laws agents social change
history defined human praxis therefore includes human will
nonetheless will-power cannot achieve anything likes any given situation consciousness working-class reaches stage development necessary action will encounter historical circumstances cannot arbitrarily altered
however predetermined historical inevitability destiny several possible developments will take place result
critique economism also extended practised syndicalists italian trade unions
believed many trade unionists settled reformist gradualist approach refused struggle political front addition economic front
gramsci much ruling class look beyond own immediate economic interests reorganise forms own hegemony must working-class present own interests congruous universal advancement society
while gramsci envisioned trade unions organ counter-hegemonic force capitalist society trade union leaders simply saw these organizations means improve conditions within existing structure
gramsci referred views these trade unionists vulgar economism equated covert reformism even liberalism
critique materialism virtue belief human history collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question meaningful gramsci's views run contrary metaphysical materialism 'copy' theory perception advanced engels lenin though does explicitly state
gramsci marxism does deal reality exists itself independent humanity
concept objective universe outside human history human praxis view analogous belief god
gramsci defined objectivity terms universal intersubjectivity established future communist society
natural history thus meaningful relation human history
view philosophical materialism resulted lack critical thought oppose religious dogma superstition
despite gramsci resigned himself existence arguably cruder form marxism
marxism philosophy proletariat subaltern class thus often expressed form popular superstition common sense
nonetheless necessary effectively challenge ideologies educated classes marxists must present their philosophy sophisticated guise attempt genuinely understand their opponents’ views
influence gramsci's thought emanates organized left also become important figure current academic discussions within cultural studies critical theory
political theorists center right also found insight concepts idea hegemony example become widely cited
influence particularly strong contemporary political science see neo-gramscianism
work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse popular culture scholarly popular culture studies many found potential political ideological resistance dominant government business interests
[citation needed] critics charge fostering notion power struggle through ideas
find gramscian approach philosophical analysis reflected current academic controversies conflict open-ended liberal inquiry grounded apolitical readings classics western culture
gramscians counter thoughts liberal inquiry apolitical reading utterly naive gramscians these intellectual devices used maintain hegemony capitalist class
credit blame gramsci travails current academic politics odd turn history since gramsci himself never academic fact deeply intellectually engaged italian culture history current liberal thought
socialist gramsci's legacy disputed
6–7 togliatti led party renamed italian communist party pci after world war ii whose gradualist approach forerunner eurocommunism claimed pci's practices during period congruent gramscian thought
others however argued gramsci left communist
