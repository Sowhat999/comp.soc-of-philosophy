bernstein principally concerned refuting marx's predictions imminent inevitable demise capitalism marx's consequent laissez faire policy opposed ameliorative social interventions before demise
bernstein indicated simple facts considered evidence marx's predictions being borne out noted centralisation capitalist industry while significant becoming wholescale ownership capital becoming less diffuse
marx's belief disappearance middleman bernstein declared entrepreneur class being steadily recruited proletariat class therefore compromise measures such state regulation hours labor provisions old-age pensions should encouraged
reason bernstein urged laboring classes take active interest politics
bernstein also indicated considered flaws marx's labor theory value
bernstein vilified orthodox marxists led rosa luxemburg revisionism
bernstein remained however very much socialist albeit unorthodox believed socialism achieved capitalism capitalism's destruction rights gradually won workers their cause grievance diminished consequently too motivation revolution
during intra-party debates ideas bernstein explained final goal socialism nothing progress toward goal everything
socialism rosa luxemburg argued end social revolution
revisionism she amounts practice advice
abandon social revolution--the goal social democracy--and turn social reform means class struggle final aim
she says revisionism lost sight scientific socialism reverted idealism therefore lost predictive force
since reformists underestimate anarchy capitalism say adaptability viability mean contradictions capitalism will historical necessity drive doom she abandon objective necessity socialism give up hope socialist future
movement will collapse unless revisionism repudiated
trade unionists see successes capitalism improvement working conditions wanted improve working conditions through parliament generally followed bernstein while hard core intellectuals generally followed luxemburg
although marx argue free trade quickest fulfillment capitalist system thus end bernstein considered protectionism helping selective few being fortschrittsfeindlich anti-progressive negative effects masses
germany's protectionism bernstein argued based political expediency isolating germany world especially britain creating autarky result conflict germany rest world
bernstein's views jewish matters evolved
never identified zionist
yet after initially favoring wholly assimilationist solution jewish question attitude toward zionism became considerably sympathetic after world war
bernstein also noted being first socialists deal sympathetically issue homosexuality
