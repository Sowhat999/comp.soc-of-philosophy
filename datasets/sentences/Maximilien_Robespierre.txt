333 original french«il faut une volonté une
il faut qu'elle soit républicaine ou royaliste
pour qu'elle soit républicaine il faut des ministres républicains des papiers républicains des députés républicains un gouvernement républicain
guerre étrangère est ime maladie mortelle fléau mortel tandis que le corps politique est malade de révolution et de division des volontés
les dangers intérieurs viennent des bourgeois pour vaincre les bourgeois il faut rallier le peuple
insurrection actuelle continue jusqu'à ce que les mesures nécessaîres pour sauver république aient été prises
faut que le peuple sal ue à convention et que convention se serve du peuple
»courtois edme-bonaventure 1828
