regards pesticide ddt carson never actually called outright ban
part argument she made silent spring even ddt other insecticides no environmental side effects their indiscriminate overuse counter-productive because create insect resistance pesticides making pesticides useless eliminating target insect populations no responsible person contends insect-borne disease should ignored

ddt never banned anti-malarial use ban agricultural use united states 1972 apply outside us anti-malaria spraying international treaty banned most uses ddt other organochlorine pesticides — 2001 stockholm convention persistent organic pollutants — included exemption ddt use malaria control until affordable substitutes found
mass outdoor spraying ddt abandoned poor countries subject malaria such sri lanka 1970 s 1980 s because government prohibitions because ddt lost ability kill mosquitoes because insects' very short breeding cycle large number offspring most resistant insects survive pass their genetic traits their offspring replace pesticide-slain insects relatively rapidly
agricultural spraying pesticides produces resistance pesticide seven ten years
consequently experts argued restrictions placed agricultural use ddt increased effectiveness tool battling malaria
according pro-ddt advocate amir attaran result 2004 stockholm convention banning ddt's use agriculture arguably better status quo
