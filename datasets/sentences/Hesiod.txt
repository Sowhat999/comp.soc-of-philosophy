epic narrative allowed poets like homer no opportunity personal revelations
however hesiod's extant work comprises didactic poems went out way let audience few details life
there three explicit references works days well passages theogony support inferences made scholars
former poem says father came cyme aeolis coast asia minor little south island lesbos crossed sea settle hamlet near thespiae boeotia named ascra cursed place cruel winter hard summer never pleasant works l
hesiod's patrimony there small piece ground foot mount helicon occasioned lawsuits brother perses seems first cheated rightful share thanks corrupt authorities kings later became impoverished ended up scrounging thrifty poet works l

unlike their father hesiod averse sea travel once crossed narrow strait greek mainland euboea participate funeral celebrations athamas chalcis there won tripod singing competition
also describes meeting himself muses mount helicon pasturing sheep goddesses presented laurel staff symbol poetic authority theogony ll
22–35 fanciful though story might seem account led ancient modern scholars infer play lyre professionally trained presented lyre instead
[nb 1] scholars seen perses literary creation foil moralizing hesiod develops works days there also arguments against theory
example quite common works moral instruction imaginative setting means getting audience's attention[nb 2] difficult see how hesiod travelled around countryside entertaining people narrative himself account known fictitious
gregory nagy other hand sees both persēs destroyer πέρθω perthō hēsiodos emits voice ἵημι hiēmi αὐδή audē fictitious names poetical personae
hesiod muse gustave moreau
here presented lyre contradicts account given hesiod himself gift laurel staff
might seem unusual hesiod's father migrated asia minor westwards mainland greece opposite direction most colonial movements time hesiod himself gives no explanation
however around 750 bc little later there migration seagoing merchants original home cyme asia minor cumae campania colony shared euboeans possibly move west something since euboea far boetia eventually established himself family
family association cyme might explain familiarity eastern myths evident poems though greek world might already developed own versions them
spite hesiod's complaints poverty life father's farm too uncomfortable works days anything judge since describes routines prosperous yeomanry rather peasants
farmer employs friend l
370 well servants ll

469–71 slave boy cover seed ll

modern scholar surmises hesiod may learned world geography especially catalogue rivers theogony ll
337–45 listening father's accounts own sea voyages merchant father probably spoke aeolian dialect cyme hesiod probably grew up speaking local boeotian dialect
however while poetry features aeolisms there no words certainly boeotian—he composed main literary dialect time homer's dialect ionian
probable hesiod poems down dictated them rather passed them orally rhapsodes did—otherwise pronounced personality now emerges poems surely diluted through oral transmission rhapsode another
pausanias asserted boeotians showed old tablet made lead works engraved
write dictate perhaps aid memory because lacked confidence ability produce poems extempore trained rhapsodes
certainly wasn't quest immortal fame since poets era no such notions
however scholars suspect presence large-scale changes text attribute oral transmission
possibly composed verses during idle times farm spring before may harvest dead winter
personality behind poems unsuited kind aristocratic withdrawal typical rhapsode instead argumentative suspicious ironically humorous frugal fond proverbs wary women
fact misogynist same calibre later poet semonides
resembles solon preoccupation issues good versus evil how just all-powerful god allow unjust flourish life
resembles aristophanes rejection idealised hero epic literature favour idealised view farmer
yet fact eulogise kings theogony ll
80 ff 430 434 denounce them corrupt works days suggests resemble whichever audience composed
various legends accumulated hesiod recorded several sources story poetic contest ἀγών / agōn homer hesiod vita hesiod byzantine grammarian john tzetzes entry hesiod suda two passages scattered remarks pausanias ix 31
3–6 38
3–4 passage plutarch moralia 162
two different—yet early—traditions record site hesiod's grave
early thucydides reported plutarch suda john tzetzes states delphic oracle warned hesiod die nemea fled locris killed local temple nemean zeus buried there
tradition follows familiar ironic convention oracle predicts accurately after
other tradition first mentioned epigram chersias orchomenus written 7 th century bc within century hesiod's death claims hesiod lies buried orchomenus town boeotia
according aristotle's constitution orchomenus thespians ravaged ascra villagers sought refuge orchomenus following advice oracle collected ashes hesiod set them place honour their agora next tomb minyas their eponymous founder
eventually came regard hesiod too their hearth-founder οἰκιστής / oikistēs
later writers attempted harmonize these two accounts
dating modern mount helicon—hesiod once described nearby hometown ascra cruel winter hard summer never pleasant
greeks late fifth early 4 th centuries bc considered their oldest poets orpheus musaeus hesiod homer—in order
thereafter greek writers began consider homer earlier hesiod
devotees orpheus musaeus probably responsible precedence being given their two cult heroes maybe homeridae responsible later antiquity promoting homer hesiod's expense
first known writers locate homer earlier hesiod xenophanes heraclides ponticus though aristarchus samothrace first actually argue case
ephorus made homer younger cousin hesiod 5 th century bc historian herodotus histories 2
53 evidently considered them near-contemporaries 4 th century bc sophist alcidamas work mouseion even brought them together imagined poetic agon survives today contest homer hesiod
most scholars today agree homer's priority there good arguments either side
hesiod certainly predates lyric elegiac poets whose work come down modern era
[citation needed] imitations work observed alcaeus epimenides mimnermus semonides tyrtaeus archilochus inferred latest possible date 650 bc
upper limit 750 bc indicated number considerations such probability work written down fact mentions sanctuary delphi little national significance before c
750 bc theogony l
499 lists rivers flow euxine region explored developed greek colonists beginning th century bc
theogony 337–45
hesiod mentions poetry contest chalcis euboea sons amphidamas awarded tripod works days ll
plutarch identified amphidamas hero lelantine war chalcis eretria concluded passage must interpolation hesiod's original work assuming lelantine war too late hesiod
modern scholars accepted identification amphidamas disagreed conclusion
date war known precisely estimates placing around 730–705 bc fit estimated chronology hesiod
case tripod hesiod won might awarded rendition theogony poem seems presuppose kind aristocratic audience met chalcis
works three works survived attributed hesiod ancient commentators works days theogony shield heracles
other works attributed found now fragments
surviving works fragments written conventional metre language epic
however shield heracles now known spurious probably written sixth century bc
many ancient critics also rejected theogony e
pausanias 9
3 even though hesiod mentions himself name poem
theogony works days might very different subject matter share distinctive language metre prosody subtly distinguish them homer's work shield heracles see hesiod's greek below
moreover both refer same version prometheus myth
yet even these authentic poems may include interpolations
example first ten verses works days may borrowed orphic hymn zeus recognised work hesiod critics ancient pausanias
scholars detected proto-historical perspective hesiod view rejected paul cartledge example grounds hesiod advocates not-forgetting without any attempt verification
hesiod also considered father gnomic verse
passion systematizing explaining things
ancient greek poetry general strong philosophical tendencies hesiod like homer demonstrates deep interest wide range 'philosophical' issues nature divine justice beginnings human society
aristotle metaphysics 983 b–987 believed question first causes may even started hesiod theogony 116–53 homer iliad 14

ambivalence appears underlie presentation human history works days depicts golden period life easy good followed steady decline behaviour happiness through silver bronze iron ages except inserts heroic age last two representing warlike men better their bronze predecessors
seems case catering two different world-views epic aristocratic other unsympathetic heroic traditions aristocracy
theogony 16 th-century manuscript theogony main article theogony theogony commonly considered hesiod's earliest work
despite different subject matter poem works days most scholars notable exceptions believe two works written same man
west writes both bear marks distinct personality surly conservative countryman given reflection no lover women life felt gods' presence heavy
theogony concerns origins world cosmogony gods theogony beginning chaos gaia tartarus eros shows special interest genealogy
embedded greek myth there remain fragments quite variant tales hinting rich variety myth once existed city city hesiod's retelling old stories became according herodotus accepted version linked hellenes
creation myth hesiod long held eastern influences such hittite song kumarbi babylonian enuma elis
cultural crossover occurred eighth ninth century greek trading colonies such al mina north syria
discussion read robin lane fox's travelling heroes walcot's hesiod near east
works days main article works days works days poem over 800 lines revolves around two general truths labour universal lot man willing work will get
scholars interpreted work against background agrarian crisis mainland greece inspired wave documented colonisations search new land
poem earliest known musings economic thought
work lays out five ages man well containing advice wisdom prescribing life honest labour attacking idleness unjust judges like those decided favour perses well practice usury
describes immortals roam earth watching over justice injustice
poem regards labor source good both gods men hate idle resemble drones hive
horror triumph violence over hard work honor verses describing golden age present social character practice nonviolent diet through agriculture fruit-culture higher path living sufficiently
other writings addition theogony works days numerous other poems ascribed hesiod during antiquity
modern scholarship doubted their authenticity these works generally referred forming part hesiodic corpus whether their authorship accepted
situation summed up formulation glenn most hesiod name person hesiodic designation kind poetry including limited poems authorship may reasonably assigned hesiod himself
these works forming extended hesiodic corpus shield heracles ἀσπὶς ἡρακλέους aspis hērakleous transmitted intact via medieval manuscript tradition
classical authors also attributed hesiod lengthy genealogical poem known catalogue women ehoiai because sections began greek words ē hoiē like
mythological catalogue mortal women mated gods offspring descendants these unions
several additional hexameter poems ascribed hesiod megalai ehoiai poem similar catalogue women presumably longer
wedding ceyx poem concerning heracles' attendance wedding certain ceyx—noted riddles
melampodia genealogical poem treats families myths associated great seers mythology
idaean dactyls work concerning mythological smelters idaean dactyls

aegimius heroic epic concerning dorian aegimius variously attributed hesiod cercops miletus

also attributed homer
ornithomantia work bird omens followed works days
addition these works suda lists otherwise unknown dirge batrachus [hesiod's] beloved
reception sappho's countryman contemporary lyric poet alcaeus paraphrased section works days 582–88 recasting lyric meter lesbian dialect
paraphrase survives fragment
lyric poet bacchylides quoted/paraphrased hesiod victory ode addressed hieron syracuse commemorating tyrant's win chariot race pythian games 470 bc attribution made these words man boeotia hesiod minister [sweet] muses spoke thus 'he whom immortals honour attended also good report men
however quoted words found hesiod's extant work
[nb 3] hesiod's catalogue women created vogue catalogue poems hellenistic period
thus example theocritus presents catalogues heroines two bucolic poems 3
40–51 20
34–41 both passages recited character lovelorn rustics
portrait bust ancient bronze bust so-called pseudo-seneca now conjectured imaginative portrait hesiod
roman bronze bust so-called pseudo-seneca late first century bc found herculaneum now thought seneca younger
identified gisela richter imagined portrait hesiod
fact recognized since 1813 bust seneca inscribed herma portrait seneca quite different features discovered
most scholars now follow richter's identification
[nb 4] hesiod's greek hesiod employed conventional dialect epic verse ionian
comparisons homer native ionian unflattering
hesiod's handling dactylic hexameter masterful fluent homer's modern scholar refers hobnailed hexameters
use language meter works days theogony distinguishes also author shield heracles
three poets example employed digamma inconsistently sometimes allowing affect syllable length meter sometimes
ratio observance/neglect digamma varies them
extent variation depends how evidence collected interpreted there clear trend revealed example following set statistics
theogony 2
5/1 works days
5/1 shield 5
9/1 homer 5
4/1[nb 5] hesiod does observe digamma often others
result bit counter-intuitive since digamma still feature boeotian dialect hesiod probably spoke whereas already vanished ionic vernacular homer
anomaly explained fact hesiod made conscious effort compose like ionian epic poet time digamma heard ionian speech while homer tried compose like older generation ionian bards heard ionian speech
there also significant difference results theogony works days merely due fact former includes catalog divinities therefore makes frequent use definite article associated digamma oἱ
carmina though typical epic vocabulary features significant differences homer's
scholar counted 278 un-homeric words works days 151 theogony 95 shield heracles
disproportionate number un-homeric words w & due un-homeric subject matter
[nb 6] hesiod's vocabulary also includes quite lot formulaic phrases found homer indicates may writing within different tradition
