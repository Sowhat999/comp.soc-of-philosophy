married since 1970 two sons
1970 s sadegh-zadeh inaugurated new direction philosophy medicine based like analytic philosophy application formal logic dubbed analytic philosophy medicine distinguish traditional philosophy medicine still does consider traditional style philosophizing medicine scientific endeavor belles lettres
international recognition came especially through work logic methodology clinical reasoning including artificial intelligence fuzzy logic application theory medical decision-making
founding editor two international journals first metamed founded 1977 renamed metamedicine later
current title theoretical medicine bioethics published springer verlag second artificial intelligence medicine founded 1989 published elsevier
extensive work includes following innovative theories comprehensive theory medicine presented monumental handbook theory fuzzy biopolymers prototype resemblance theory disease palimpsest theory mind theory technoevolution machina sapiens
work analytic philosophy medicine sadegh-zadeh conceives analytic philosophy medicine philosophy medicine analytic tradition philosophizing
philosophy medicine means logical conceptual analysis primary fields inquiry being philosophy medical language medical praxiology
philosophy methodology logic medical practice medical epistemology medical deontics
analysis medical morality obligations law medical logic medical metaphysics philosophy medical language sadegh-zadeh considers medical language ill-structured ill-kept extension everyday language adding technical terms such angina pectoris appendicitis etc
most terms imprecise ambiguous because either undefined ill-defined
since significant impact both medical knowledge medical decision-making devotes himself extensively analysis nature syntax semantics pragmatics
demonstrates analyzes inherent vagueness medical terms constructs techniques dealing principally ineliminable feature means fuzzy logic
end introduces comprehensive methodology medical including fuzzy concept formation
inspired patrick suppes's carl gustav hempel's pioneering works bases methodology lucid unique explication formalization methods definition known today
medical praxiology medical clinical praxiology old term introduced sadegh-zadeh 1977-1981 already denote wide-ranging inquiry foundations clinical practice particularly clinical judgment decision-making aim reducing diagnostic-therapeutic errors improving physician performance
latter article referred defined term explicitly analysis clinical practice inquiry clinical practice theory clinical practice
philosophy methodology logic medical doing acting
central topics include everything related concepts theories basic clinical practice
concepts theories patient suffering health illness disease diagnosis etiology prognosis therapy prevention
perspective creates fertile scientific field host tasks ranging conceptual analyses like disease? diagnosis? differential diagnosis? etc
logical analyses such clinical decision-making computable does require human intelligence intuition? epistemology ethics metaphysics clinical decision-making forth
over past decades sadegh-zadeh's clinical praxiology reached remarkably high level sophistication encompassing innovative investigations frameworks
include novel approaches topics mentioned above
prominent among them prototype resemblance theory disease presenting laborious fuzzy-logical explication vague concept disease demonstrates means say concept disease non-classical therefore amenable traditional methods inquiry
theory undertakes reconstruction disease category contradistinction traditional views based set common features members individual diseases few best examples category called prototypes similarity relationship such human condition considered disease resembles prototype
enables new approaches resolving many stubborn problems associated concept disease
medical epistemology medical epistemology philosophy medical knowledge simply theory medical knowledge
sadegh-zadeh conceived task branch philosophy medicine already 1982 deploring contemporary philosophy medicine movement mainly concerned medical-ethical problems while unduly neglecting medical-epistemological ones
category medical knowledge consists statements spatio-temporally localized facts general hypotheses theories
sadegh-zadeh proposed elaborate systematics types medical hypotheses knowledge latter ones including classificatory knowledge causal knowledge experimental knowledge theoretical knowledge practical knowledge clinical knowledge medical metaknowledge
most important among them called practical knowledge know-how medicine
formally precise explication knowledge type shows medical-practical knowledge actually consists conditional norms
deontic conditionals mainly conditional obligations
reasons why sadegh-zadeh considers medicine deontic discipline
specifically views clinical practice practiced morality because clinical decision-making nothing application conditional obligations diagnostic-therapeutic rules action primarily consist
since clinical research pursues such rules action tries improve available ones constitutes explorative normative ethics based empirical research experience
central role sadegh-zadeh's medical epistemology play medical theories
analyzes concept medical theory line so-called structuralist view theories represent their structure content according patrick suppes joseph
sneed's approach set-theoretic predicates
enables show theory medicine cannot confirmed supported disconfirmed verified falisfied simply because merely conceptual structure no epistemic entity true probable false
does make any empirical claims world
such claims made using theory tool
claims themselves empirical hypotheses something different theory
medical theories non-epistemic entities deserve ascription truth falsehood
regarding any other piece general medical knowledge sadegh-zadeh shows apart gettier problem does fulfill classical definition knowledge justified true belief
according detailed analysis there no justified true beliefs medicine
statements hypotheses theories medicine other fileds usually viewed knowledge because ascription knowledge example aids caused hiv knowledge performative conducted affirmed scientific professional community social group
communitarian social epistemology goes back polish physician epistemologist ludwik fleck 1896–1961 profitably utilzed extended sadegh-zadeh
medical deontics apart deontic nature medical-practical knowledge referred above second reason why sadegh-zadeh classifies medicine deontic field view according prototype resemblance theory disease concept disease inherently value-laden
because prototype diseases upon nosology based phenomena disvalued human beings therefore considered something ought
means consequently other diseases their resemblants deontic entities
deonticity medicine disease basic concept necessitates according sadegh-zadeh specific inquiry means suitable tools methods
deontic logic
research field terms medical deontics
also includes medical ethics medical metaethics medical law
medical logic publications entitled logic medicine give rise question whether medicine own logic like quantum logic argued logic quantum mechanics
answer question sadegh-zadeh distinguishes logic medicine logic medicine
logic medicine means class logics may applied medicine solve theoretical practical problems
examples classical two-valued logic many-valued logic paraconsistent logic deontic logic temporal logic probability logic fuzzy logic
their number unlimited
none them specifically made medical use
logical pluralism medicine parallels mathematical pluralism innumerable mathematical theories used medicine well without any them being mathematics medicine
there no logic medicine sadegh-zadeh concludes logic viewed used specifically medical logic
medical metaphysics medical metaphysics primarily concerned medical ontology ii medical truth iii nature medicine
medical ontology
sadegh-zadeh devotes himself extensively pure formal applied ontology use them logical analysis medical-ontological issues medical knowledge clinical practice nosology psychiatry psychosomatics biomedicine such example whether diseases exist fictitious entities invented nosologists physicians whether particular other things such genes psyche schizophrenia exist mere myths
settle these enduring controversies similar ones medicine first distinguishes ontology de re ontology de dicto
distinction based syntactic criterion similar barcan formula enables differentiation fictional entities such sherlock holmes real ones
second inaugurates intriguing fuzzy ontology introducing many-place existence operator fuzzyfying operator obtain quantitative concept existence calls heraclitean operator
heraclitean operator ranges over domain imaginable entities including existent non-existent fictitious ones over possible frames reference frame reference being particular language particular logic
result entity exists does exist fictitious particular extent unit interval [0 1] respect particular language particular logic
way ontological stances such realism anti-realism fictionalism regarding whether something exists become obsolete
example schizophrenia may exist respect eugen bleuler 1857-1939 followers' language logic while thomas szasz followers may view myth respect their language logic
remedy irreconcilable ontological controversies similar type care one's unkempt language logic reach agreement language conceptual system logic should used particular scientific discourse
anyhow medical language sublanguages ill-structured ill-kempt workaday languages absolutely unsuitable serious discourses
allow their users too much latitude interpretation
change your language logic you will see another world
fuzzy ontology also includes fuzzy mereology mereotopology means vague part-whole relationships example anatomy surgery other medical fields become logically tractable
addition developed technique bring light ontological commitments any piece medical knowledge ascertain ontological prerequisites satisfiability
hopes paved way thereby precise medical model theory analogy mathematical might enable sophisticated knowledge ontology medicine elsewhere thus advanced medical epistemology
such medical model theory relationships models different items medical knowledge including theories precisely analyzed
however very skeptical recently come known biomedical ontology engineering biomedical computer information sciences
does regard endeavor ontology because actually concerned vocabularies terminologies confirming slogan ontology recapitulates philology
ii medical truth
after thorough discussion truth theories sadegh-zadeh shows there sufficient evidence support assertion medical truths system-relative produced within respective health care systems themselves
mirror report scientifically discovered facts world out there independent conceptual system viewed judged
problem concerns truth medical sciences also truth clinical practice
specifically precisely explicates concepts diagnosis differential diagnosis misdiagnosis demonstrate truth falsehood these outcomes clinical decision-making relative respective medical language knowledge used methods inquiry applied conceptual systems vocabularies terminologies constructed proposed scientific professional communities regulations issued health authorities other factors health care system impact actions interactions diagnostic personnel
according sadegh-zadeh medical truth made medicine
iii nature medicine
analytic philosophy medicine sadegh-zadeh places particular emphasis analysis medicine scientific field
abandoning widespread shallow mono-categorizations such medicine science versus medicine art demonstrates declarations type medicine such such global term medicine should differentiated acknowledge medicine comprising many heterogeneous disciplines belongs large number categories
example without doubt biomedicine natural science clinical research however practical science also normative ethics clinical practice practiced morality
worth noting medicine also poietic science greek term ποίησις making creating invents designs produces medical devices widest sense term making drugs prosthetics brain chips artificial organs artificial babies
medicine thus way become engineering science conducted health engineering anthropotechnology
applied fuzzy logic application fuzzy set theory fuzzy logic biomedical subjects clinical problems philosophical issues sadegh-zadeh's main interests
prominent among achievements area reconstruction biopolymers such nucleic acid chains dna rna polypeptide chains ordered fuzzy sets
theory fuzzy biopolymers made biopolymers amenable fuzzy set theory logic proved very fruitful thereby stimulate research interest different teams
other examples extensive application fuzzy logic clinical praxiology problems clinical decision-making ii fuzzification deontics ontology
philosophy technology methodology fuzzy concept formation sadegh-zadeh introduced fuzzy concept self-reproduction termed quasiself-reproduction enabled interpret self-reproducing machines completely new way suggest intriguing theory technoevolution
there something nature technology says human beings cannot afford ignore
tendency machines join up work together effect larger machine emerges being efficient powerful parts
peculiarity led last centuries growth distributed unique global machine gm consists network machines around earth
how globalization machine occur gm looks like reconstructed explained theory
comparable bioevolution animal plant species technoevolution proceeds darwinian quasiself-reproduction selection
gm constitutes subsystem hybrid hypercycle two evolving partners biosphere technosphere due enormous dynamics hypercycle rapidly coevolve
part technosphere salient yield coevolution advancing mentalization gm process human beings misconceive artificial intelligence constructed them
according sadegh-zadeh's theory myopic interpretation gradual natural emergence intelligent self-conscious machina sapiens guise globally distributed machine
