sagan frequently religion relationship religion science expressing skepticism conventional conceptualization god sapient being
example people think god outsized light-skinned male long white beard sitting throne somewhere up there sky busily tallying fall every sparrow
others—for example baruch spinoza albert einstein—considered god essentially sum total physical laws describe universe
know any compelling evidence anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny hidden celestial vantage point madness deny existence physical laws
another description view concept god sagan emphatically writes idea god oversized white male flowing beard sits sky tallies fall every sparrow ludicrous
god means set physical laws govern universe then clearly there such god
god emotionally unsatisfying
does make much sense pray law gravity
atheism sagan commented 1981 atheist someone certain god does exist someone compelling evidence against existence god
know no such compelling evidence
because god relegated remote times places ultimate causes know great deal universe now sure no such god exists
certain existence god certain nonexistence god seem me confident extremes subject riddled doubt uncertainty inspire very little confidence indeed
sagan also commented christianity stating my long-time view christianity represents amalgam two seemingly immiscible parts religion jesus religion paul
thomas jefferson attempted excise pauline parts new testament
there wasn't much left done inspiring document
regarding relationship spirituality science sagan stated science compatible spirituality profound source spirituality
recognize our place immensity light-years passage ages grasp intricacy beauty subtlety life then soaring feeling sense elation humility combined surely spiritual
environmental appeal preserving cherishing earth signed sagan other noted scientists january 1990 stated historical record makes clear religious teaching example leadership powerfully able influence personal conduct commitment
thus there vital role religion science
reply question 1996 religious beliefs sagan answered i'm agnostic
sagan maintained idea creator god universe difficult prove disprove conceivable scientific discovery challenge infinitely old universe
sagan's views religion interpreted form pantheism comparable einstein's belief spinoza's god
son dorion sagan my father believed god spinoza einstein god behind nature nature equivalent
