1935 discovered possible interpretation boolean algebra logic electro-mechanical relay circuits
graduated moscow state university 1934 worked there general physics department almost until death

early 20 th century relay circuits began widely used automatics defense electric communications systems
[clarification needed] every relay circuit schema practical use distinct invention because general principle simulation these systems known
[citation needed] shestakov's credit independently later claude shannon's general theory logical simulation inspired rapidly increasing complexity technical demands
logical simulation requires solid mathematical foundations
namely these foundations originally established shestakov
shestakov set forth algebraic logic model electrical two-pole switches later three- four-pole switches series parallel connections schematic elements resistors capacitors magnets inductive coils etc
resistance these elements take arbitrary values real-number line upon two-element set {0 ∞} degenerates bivalent boolean algebra logic
shestakov may considered forerunner combinatorial logic application hence boolean algebra logic well electric engineering 'language' broad enough simulate non-electrical objects any conceivable physical nature
pioneer study merged continual algebraic logic parametrical topological structural models
