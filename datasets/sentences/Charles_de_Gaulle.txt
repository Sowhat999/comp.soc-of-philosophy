president john f
kennedy admired stance against soviet union—particularly berlin wall being built—and called great captain western world their relationship later cooled
de gaulle kennedy's most loyal ally during cuban missile crisis supported right united states claimed defend interests western hemisphere contrast then german chancellor konrad adenauer doubted kennedy's commitment europe thought crisis avoided
de gaulle accepted might necessary united states take preemptive military action against cuba unlike many other european leaders time
de gaulle prominent figure kennedy's funeral
de gaulle very much admired later president nixon
after meeting palace versailles just before general left office nixon declared try put airs aura majesty seemed envelop
performance—and use word disparagingly—was breathtaking
arriving funeral several months later nixon greatness knows no national boundaries
general vernon
walters military attaché dwight eisenhower later military attaché france 1967–1973 noted strong relationship de gaulle eisenhower de gaulle's unconditional support eisenhower during u-2 incident de gaulle's strong support john f
kennedy during cuban missile crisis
thus walters intensely curious great contrast de gaulle's close relations two united states presidents during notable cold war crises de gaulle's later decision withdraw france nato's military command walters spoke many close military political aides de gaulle
walters' conclusion based upon de gaulle's comments many aides eisenhower during meeting ramboullet castle 1959 de gaulle feared later united states presidents after eisenhower eisenhower's special ties europe risk nuclear war over europe
also de gaulle interpreted peaceful resolution cuban missile crisis without fighting take back cuba communism mere 90 miles united states indication united states might fight europe's defense 3500 miles away following soviet aggression europe go war following nuclear strike against united states itself
de gaulle eisenhower france seek compete strategic air command army united states believed france needed way strike soviet union
number commentators critical de gaulle failure prevent massacres after algerian independence while others take view struggle long savage perhaps inevitable
australian historian brian crozier able part algeria without civil war great though negative achievement probability beyond capacity any other leader france possessed
april 1961 four rebel generals seized power algeria flinch face daunting challenge appeared television general's uniform forbid frenchmen obey rebels' orders inflexible display personal authority
de gaulle excellent manipulator media seen shrewd use television persuade around 80% metropolitan france approve new constitution fifth republic
doing refused yield reasoning opponents succeeded algeria no longer necessary
afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings once every frenchman will gaullist
de gaulle necessarily reflect mainstream french public opinion veto suggested decisive majority french people voted favour british membership much conciliatory pompidou called referendum matter 1972
early influence setting parameters eec still seen today most notably controversial common agricultural policy
writers take view pompidou progressive influential leader de gaulle because though also gaullist less autocratic interested social reforms
although followed main tenets de gaulle's foreign policy keen work towards warmer relations united states
banker profession pompidou also widely credited de gaulle's prime minister 1962–1968 putting place reforms provided impetus economic growth followed
1968 shortly before leaving office de gaulle refused devalue franc grounds national prestige upon taking over pompidou reversed decision almost straight away
ironic during financial crisis 1968 france rely american west german financial aid help shore up economy
perry written events 1968 illustrated brittleness de gaulle's rule
taken surprise indictment rule too remote real life no interest conditions under ordinary french people lived
problems like inadequate housing social services ignored
french greeted news departure relief feeling grown outlived usefulness
perhaps clung onto power too long perhaps should retired 1965 still popular
brian crozier fame de gaulle outstrips achievements chose make repeated gestures petulance defiance weakened west without compensating advantages france régis debray called de gaulle super-lucide pointed out virtually predictions such fall communism reunification germany resurrection 'old' russia came true after death
debray compared napoleon 'the great political myth 19 th century' calling de gaulle 20 th century equivalent
sublime seems appears france once century
napoleon left two generations dead battlefield
de gaulle sparing other people's blood even left us stranded alive dazed… delusion perhaps turns world upside down causes events movements divides people supporters adversaries leaves traces form civil penal codes railways factories institutions fifth republic already lasted three times long empire
statesman gets something going followers escapes reality reports statistics become part imagination
napoleon de gaulle modified state things because modified souls
however debray pointed out there difference napoleon de gaulle how exterminator compared liberator?
former ran whole enterprise ground while latter managed save
measure rebel against despot challenger against leader just glaringly idiotic
you simply put adventurer worked himself family same level commander-in-chief serving country
regrettably gaullism bonapartism number features common napoleon de gaulle same moral value
first wanted holy french empire without faith europe under french occupation
second wanted rescue nation emperors establish free france free europe
