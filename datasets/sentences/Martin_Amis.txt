highly critical article guardian absurd world martin amis satirist chris morris likened amis muslim cleric abu hamza jailed inciting racial hatred 2006 suggesting both men employ mock erudition vitriol decontextualised quotes qu'ran incite hatred
later piece eagleton added there something rather stomach-churning sight those such amis political allies champions civilisation centuries wreaked untold carnage throughout world shrieking illegal measures find themselves first time sticky end same treatment
elsewhere amis especially careful distinguish islam radical islamism stating “ begin saying respect muhammad no serious person fail respect muhammad - unique luminous historical being
judged continuities able set motion muhammad strong claims being most extraordinary man ever lived
repeat respect islam - donor countless benefits mankind
islamism? no hardly asked respect creedal wave calls our own elimination

term since argued wrongly applied
political opinions attacked quarters particularly guardian
received support other writers
spectator philip hensher noted “ controversy raised amis’s views religion specifically embodied islamists empty
will tell you loathing limited islamists even islam certainly ethnic groups concerned
point think demonstrated openness willing think out loud usefully emulated political figures addicted weasel words double talk

also independent terence blacker criticised amis' article snobbery patronising noting amis born social cultural privilege
blacker amis' article unintentionally hilarious piece diatribe whilst also suggesting amis inadvertently convert many supporting corbyn instead
agnosticism 2006 amis agnostic respectable position simply because our ignorance universe vast atheism premature
clearly there's going any kind anthropomorphic entity universe incredibly complicated over our heads cannot exclude existence intelligence behind
2010 i'm agnostic rational position
it's because feel god think anything resembling banal god religion will turn up
think atheism sounds like proof something it's incredibly evident nowhere near intelligent enough understand universe
writers above individualists above writing freedom will go off sorts directions
think does apply debate religion it's crabbed novelist pulls shutters down says there's no other thing
don't use word god something intelligent us
can't understand then it's formidable
understand very little
