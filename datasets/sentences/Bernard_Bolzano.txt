career bolzano entered university prague 1796 studied mathematics philosophy physics
starting 1800 also began studying theology becoming catholic priest 1804
appointed then newly created chair philosophy religion prague university 1805
proved popular lecturer just religion also philosophy elected dean philosophical faculty 1818
bolzano alienated many faculty church leaders teachings social waste militarism needlessness war
urged total reform educational social economic systems direct nation's interests toward peace rather toward armed conflict nations
upon refusal recant beliefs bolzano dismissed university 1819
political convictions inclined share others frequency eventually proved too liberal austrian authorities
exiled countryside point devoted energies writings social religious philosophical mathematical matters
although forbidden publish mainstream journals condition exile bolzano continued develop ideas publish them either own obscure eastern european journals
1842 moved back prague died 1848
works bolzano's posthumously published work paradoxien des unendlichen paradoxes infinite 1851 greatly admired many eminent logicians came after including charles sanders peirce georg cantor richard dedekind
bolzano's main claim fame however 1837 wissenschaftslehre theory science work four volumes covered philosophy science modern sense also logic epistemology scientific pedagogy
logical theory bolzano developed work come acknowledged ground-breaking
other works four-volume lehrbuch religionswissenschaft textbook science religion metaphysical work athanasia defense immortality soul
bolzano also valuable work mathematics remained virtually unknown until otto stolz rediscovered many lost journal articles republished them 1881
wissenschaftslehre theory science 1837 wissenschaftslehre bolzano attempted provide logical foundations sciences building abstractions like part-relation abstract objects attributes sentence-shapes ideas propositions themselves sums sets collections substances adherences subjective ideas judgments sentence-occurrences
these attempts basically extension earlier thoughts philosophy mathematics example 1810 beiträge emphasized distinction objective relationship logical consequences our subjective recognition these connections
bolzano enough merely confirmation natural mathematical truths rather proper role sciences both pure applied seek out justification terms fundamental truths may may appear obvious our intuitions
introduction wissenschaftslehre bolzano begins work explaining means theory science relation our knowledge truths sciences
human knowledge states made truths true propositions men know known
however very small fraction truths out there although still too much human being comprehend
therefore our knowledge divided accessible parts
such collection truths bolzano calls science wissenschaft
important note true propositions science known men hence how make discoveries science
better understand comprehend truths science men created textbooks lehrbuch course contain true propositions science known men
how know divide our knowledge truths belong together? bolzano explains will ultimately know through reflection resulting rules how divide our knowledge sciences will science itself
science tells us truths belong together should explained textbook theory science wissenschaftslehre
metaphysics wissenschaftslehre bolzano mainly concerned three realms realm language consisting words sentences
2 realm thought consisting subjective ideas judgements
3 realm logic consisting objective ideas ideas themselves propositions themselves
bolzano devotes great part wissenschaftslehre explanation these realms their relations
two distinctions play prominent role system
firstly distinction parts wholes
instance words parts sentences subjective ideas parts judgments objective ideas parts propositions themselves
secondly objects divide those exist means causally connected located time and/or space those exist
bolzano's original claim logical realm populated objects latter kind
satz sich proposition itself satz sich basic notion bolzano's wissenschaftslehre
introduced very beginning section 19
bolzano first introduces notions proposition spoken written thought itself idea spoken written thought itself
grass green proposition satz connection words something asserted
grass however idea vorstellung
something represented does assert anything
bolzano's notion proposition fairly broad rectangle round proposition — even though false virtue self-contradiction — because composed intelligible manner out intelligible parts
bolzano does give complete definition satz sich
proposition itself gives us just enough information understand means
proposition itself no existence no position time place ii either true false independent anyone knowing thinking true false iii 'grasped' thinking beings
written sentence 'socrates wisdom' grasps proposition itself namely proposition [socrates wisdom]
written sentence does existence certain location certain time say your computer screen very moment expresses proposition itself realm itself
bolzano's use term sich differs greatly kant kant's use term see sich
every proposition itself composed out ideas themselves simplicity will use proposition mean proposition itself idea refer objective idea idea itself
ideas negatively defined those parts proposition themselves propositions
proposition consists least three ideas namely subject idea predicate idea copula
'has' another form
though there propositions contain propositions won't take them consideration right now
bolzano identifies certain types ideas
there simple ideas no parts example bolzano uses [something] there also complex ideas consist other ideas bolzano uses example [nothing] consists ideas [not] [something]
complex ideas same content
same parts without being same — because their components differently connected
idea [a black pen blue ink] different idea [a blue pen black ink] though parts both ideas same
ideas objects important understand idea does need object
bolzano uses object denote something represented idea
idea object represents object
idea does object represents nothing
don't get confused here terminology objectless idea idea without representation
let's consider further explanation example used bolzano
idea [a round square] does object because object ought represented self-contrary
different example idea [nothing] certainly does object
however proposition [the idea round square complexity] subject-idea [the idea round square]
subject-idea does object namely idea [a round square]
idea does object
besides objectless ideas there ideas object e
idea [the first man moon] represents object
bolzano calls these ideas 'singular ideas'
obviously there also ideas many objects e
[the citizens amsterdam] even infinitely many objects e
[a prime number]
sensation simple ideas bolzano complex theory how able sense things
explains sensation means term intuition german called anschauung
intuition simple idea object einzelvorstellung besides also unique bolzano needs explain sensation
intuitions anschauungen objective ideas belong sich realm means don’t existence
bolzano’s argumentation intuitions explanation sensation
happens you sense real existing object instance rose different aspects rose like scent color cause you change
change means before after sensing rose your mind different state
sensation fact change your mental state
how related objects ideas? bolzano explains change your mind essentially simple idea vorstellung like ‘this smell’ particular rose
idea represents object change
besides being simple change must also unique
because literally you can’t same experience twice nor two people smell same rose same time exactly same experience smell although will quite alike
each single sensation causes single new unique simple idea particular change object
now idea your mind subjective idea meaning you particular time
subjective idea must correspond content objective idea
bolzano brings intuitions anschauungen simple unique objective ideas correspond our subjective ideas changes caused sensation
each single possible sensation there corresponding objective idea
schematically whole process like whenever you smell rose scent causes change you
change object your subjective idea particular smell
subjective idea corresponds intuition anschauung
logic according bolzano propositions composed out three simple complex elements subject predicate copula
instead traditional copulative term 'is' bolzano prefers 'has'
reason 'has' unlike 'is' connect concrete term such 'socrates' abstract term such 'baldness'
socrates baldness according bolzano preferable socrates bald because latter form less basic 'bald' itself composed elements 'something' 'that' 'has' 'baldness'
bolzano also reduces existential propositions form socrates exists simply become socrates existence dasein
major role bolzano’s logical theory played notion variations various logical relations defined terms changes truth value propositions incur their non-logical parts replaced others
logically analytical propositions instance those non-logical parts replaced without change truth value
two propositions 'compatible' verträglich respect their component parts x there least term inserted make both true
proposition q 'deducible' ableitbar proposition p respect certain their non-logical parts any replacement those parts makes p true also makes q true
proposition deducible another respect non-logical parts 'logically deducible'
besides relation deducibility bolzano also stricter relation 'consequentiality' abfolge
asymmetric relation obtains true propositions propositions deducible also explained other
truth bolzano distinguishes five meanings words true truth common usage bolzano takes unproblematic
meanings listed order properness
abstract objective meaning truth signifies attribute may apply proposition primarily proposition itself namely attribute basis proposition expresses something reality expressed
antonyms falsity falseness falsehood
concrete objective meaning truth signifies proposition attribute truth abstract objective meaning
antonym falsehood
subjective meaning truth signifies correct judgment
antonym mistake
collective meaning truth signifies body multiplicity true propositions judgments e
biblical truth
improper meaning true signifies object reality denomination states
true god
antonyms false unreal illusory
bolzano's primary concern concrete objective meaning concrete objective truths truths themselves
truths themselves kind propositions themselves
spatiotemporally located thought spoken propositions
however certain propositions attribute being truth itself
being thought proposition part concept truth itself notwithstanding fact given god’s omniscience truths themselves also thought truths
concepts ‘truth itself’ ‘thought truth’ interchangeable apply same objects identical
bolzano offers correct definition abstract objective truth proposition true expresses something applies object
correct definition concrete objective truth must thus truth proposition expresses something applies object
definition applies truths themselves rather thought known truths none concepts figuring definition subordinate concept something mental known
bolzano proves §§31-32 wissenschaftslehre three things there least truth itself concrete objective meaning
there no true propositions assumption 2
proposition obvious 3
true assumed false because
self-contradictory because 3
false because 4
there least true proposition because

there no other truths themselves apart because 7

there infinitely many truths themselves 13
there n truths themselves namely
z assumption 14
z n truths themselves because 13
there no other truths apart
z because 13
true proposition/ truth itself because 13
there n+1 truths themselves because 14
steps 5 repeated n+1 results n+2 truths endlessly because n variable 19
there infinitely many truths themselves because 18
judgments cognitions known truth parts bestandteile truth itself judgment bolzano wissenschaftslehre §26
judgment thought states true proposition
judging least matter judgment true proposition idea object being connected certain way idea characteristic § 23
true judgments relation idea object idea characteristic actual/existent relation §28
every judgment matter proposition either true false
every judgment exists ‘für sich’
judgments namely contrast propositions themselves dependent subjective mental activity
every mental activity though judgment recall judgments matter propositions hence judgments need either true false
mere presentations thoughts examples mental activities necessarily need stated behaupten judgments § 34
judgments matter true propositions called cognitions §36
cognitions also dependent subject opposed truths themselves cognitions permit degrees proposition less known cannot less true
every cognition implies necessarily judgment every judgment necessarily cognition because there also judgments true
bolzano maintains there no such things false cognitions false judgments §34
mathematics bolzano made several original contributions mathematics
overall philosophical stance contrary much prevailing mathematics era better introduce intuitive ideas such time motion mathematics boyer 1959 pp
end earliest mathematicians begin instilling rigor mathematical analysis three chief mathematical works beyträge zu einer begründeteren darstellung mathematik 1810 binomische lehrsatz 1816 rein analytischer beweis 1817
these works presented
sample new way developing analysis whose ultimate goal realized until fifty years later came attention karl weierstrass o'connor & robertson 2006
foundations mathematical analysis contributed introduction fully rigorous ε-δ definition mathematical limit
bolzano first recognize greatest lower bound property real numbers
like several others day skeptical[dubious discuss] possibility gottfried leibniz's infinitesimals earliest putative foundation differential calculus
bolzano's notion limit similar modern limit rather being relation among infinitesimals must instead cast terms how dependent variable approaches definite quantity independent variable approaches other definite quantity
bolzano also gave first purely analytic proof fundamental theorem algebra originally proven gauss geometrical considerations
also gave first purely analytic proof intermediate value theorem also known bolzano's theorem
today mostly remembered bolzano–weierstrass theorem karl weierstrass developed independently published years after bolzano's first proof initially called weierstrass theorem until bolzano's earlier work rediscovered boyer & merzbach p
philosophical legacy effect thought philosophy initially seemed destined slight work rediscovered however edmund husserl kazimierz twardowski both students franz brentano
through them bolzano became formative influence both phenomenology analytic philosophy
