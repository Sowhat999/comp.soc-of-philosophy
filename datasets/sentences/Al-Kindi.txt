family belonged most prominent families tribal nobility kufa early islamic period until lost much power following revolt abd al-rahman ibn muhammad ibn al-ash'ath
father ishaq governor kufa al-kindi received preliminary education there
later went complete studies baghdad patronized abbasid caliphs al-ma'mun ruled 813–833 al-mu'tasim r
account learning aptitude study al-ma'mun appointed house wisdom recently established centre translation greek philosophical scientific texts baghdad
also well known beautiful calligraphy point employed calligrapher al-mutawakkil

842–847 especially al-mutawakkil r
847–861 al-kindi's star waned
there various theories concerning attribute al-kindi's downfall scholarly rivalries house wisdom others refer al-mutawakkil’s often violent persecution unorthodox muslims well non-muslims point al-kindi beaten library temporarily confiscated
henry corbin authority islamic studies says 873 al-kindi died lonely man baghdad during reign al-mu'tamid r
after death al-kindi's philosophical works quickly fell obscurity many them lost even later islamic scholars historians
felix klein-franke suggests number reasons aside militant orthodoxy al-mutawakkil mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion
however says most probable cause writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such al-farabi avicenna ultimately overshadowed
accomplishments al-kindi master many different areas thought held greatest islamic philosophers time
italian renaissance scholar geralomo cardano 1501–1575 considered twelve greatest minds middle ages
according ibn al-nadim al-kindi least two hundred sixty books contributing heavily geometry thirty-two books medicine philosophy twenty-two books each logic nine books physics twelve books
influence fields physics mathematics medicine philosophy music far-reaching lasted several centuries
although most books lost over centuries few survived form latin translations gerard cremona others rediscovered arabic manuscripts most importantly twenty-four lost works located mid-twentieth century turkish library
philosophy greatest contribution development islamic philosophy efforts make greek thought both accessible acceptable muslim audience
al-kindi carried out mission house wisdom bayt al-hikma institute translation learning patronized abbasid caliphs baghdad
well translating many important texts much become standard arabic philosophical vocabulary originated al-kindi indeed work philosophers like al-farabi avicenna al-ghazali might possible
writings al-kindi's central concerns demonstrate compatibility philosophy natural theology hand revealed speculative theology other though fact rejected speculative theology
despite make clear believed revelation superior source knowledge reason because guaranteed matters faith reason uncover
while philosophical approach original even considered clumsy later thinkers mainly because first philosopher writing arabic language successfully incorporated aristotelian especially neo-platonist thought islamic philosophical framework
important factor introduction popularization greek philosophy muslim intellectual world
astronomy al-kindi took view solar system ptolemy placed earth centre series concentric spheres known heavenly bodies moon mercury venus sun mars jupiter stars embedded
treatises subject says these bodies rational entities whose circular motion obedience worship god
their role al-kindi believes act instruments divine providence
furnishes empirical evidence proof assertion different seasons marked particular arrangements planets stars most notably sun appearance manner people varies according arrangement heavenly bodies situated above their homeland
however ambiguous comes actual process heavenly bodies affect material world
theory posits works aristotle conceived movement these bodies causes friction sub-lunar region stirs up primary elements earth fire air water these combine produce everything material world
alternative view found treatise rays planets exercise their influence straight lines
each these presents two fundamentally different views physical interaction action contact action distance
dichotomy duplicated writings optics
notable astrological works al-kindi include book judgement stars including forty chapters questions elections
stellar rays
several epistles weather meteorology including de mutatione temporum changing weather
treatise judgement eclipses
treatise dominion arabs duration used predict end arab rule
choices days elections
revolutions years mundane astrology natal revolutions
de signis astronomiae applicitis mediciam ‘on signs astronomy applied medicine’ treatise spirituality planets
optics two major theories optics appear writings al-kindi aristotelian euclidian
aristotle believed order eye perceive object both eye object must contact transparent medium such air filled light
these criteria met sensible form object transmitted through medium eye
other hand euclid proposed vision occurred straight lines rays eye reached illuminated object reflected back
theories astrology dichotomy contact distance present al-kindi's writings subject well
factor al-kindi relied upon determine these theories most correct how adequately each explained experience seeing
example aristotle's theory unable account why angle individual sees object affects perception
example why circle viewed side will appear line
according aristotle complete sensible form circle should transmitted eye should appear circle
other hand euclidean optics provided geometric model able account well length shadows reflections mirrors because euclid believed visual rays travel straight lines something commonly accepted modern science
reason al-kindi considered latter preponderant
through latin version de aspectibus al-kindi partly influenced optical investigations robert grosseteste roger bacon
medicine there thirty treatises attributed al-kindi field medicine chiefly influenced ideas galen
most important work field probably de gradibus demonstrates application mathematics medicine particularly field pharmacology
example developed mathematical scale quantify strength drug system based phases moon allow doctor determine advance most critical days patient's illness
chemistry advanced chemist also opponent alchemy debunked myth simple base metals transformed precious metals such gold silver
also credited first distillers alcohol creating alkindus distiller used distillation alcohol
mathematics al-kindi authored works number important mathematical subjects including arithmetic geometry indian numbers harmony numbers lines multiplication numbers relative quantities measuring proportion time numerical procedures cancellation
also four volumes use indian numerals ketab fi isti'mal al-'adad al-hindi contributed greatly diffusion indian system numeration middle-east west
geometry among other works theory parallels
also related geometry two works optics
ways made use mathematics philosopher attempt disprove eternity world demonstrating actual infinity mathematical logical absurdity
first page al-kindi's manuscript deciphering cryptographic messages containing oldest known description cryptanalysis frequency analysis
cryptography al-kindi credited developing method whereby variations frequency occurrence letters analyzed exploited break ciphers

book topic istikhraj al-kotob al-mu'amah رسالة في استخراج الكتب المعماة literally extracting obscured correspondence contemporary decrypting encrypted correspondence
music theory al-kindi first great theoretician music arab-islamic world
known written fifteen treatises music theory five survived
added fifth string 'ud
works included discussions therapeutic value music regarded cosmological connections music
philosophical thought influences while muslim intellectuals already acquainted greek philosophy especially logic al-kindi credited being first real muslim philosopher
own thought largely influenced neo-platonic philosophy proclus plotinus john philoponus amongst others although does appear borrowed ideas other hellenistic schools well
makes many references aristotle writings these often unwittingly re-interpreted neo-platonic framework
trend most obvious areas such metaphysics nature god causal entity
earlier experts suggested influenced mutazilite school theology because mutual concern both demonstrated maintaining singularity tawhid god
however such agreements now considered incidental further study shown disagreed number equally important topics
metaphysics according al-kindi goal metaphysics knowledge god
reason does make clear distinction philosophy theology because believes both concerned same subject
later philosophers particularly al-farabi avicenna strongly disagree issue saying metaphysics actually concerned being qua being such nature god purely incidental
central al-kindi's understanding metaphysics god's absolute oneness considers attribute uniquely associated god therefore shared anything else
means while may think any existent thing being fact both many
example says while body also composed many different parts
person might say see elephant means see elephant term 'elephant' refers species animal contains many
therefore god absolutely both being concept lacking any multiplicity whatsoever
feel understanding entails very rigorous negative theology because implies any description predicated anything else cannot god
addition absolute oneness al-kindi also described god creator
means acts both final efficient cause
unlike later muslim neo-platonic philosophers asserted universe existed result god's existence overflowing passive act al-kindi conceived god active agent
fact god agent because other intermediary agencies contingent upon
key idea here god acts through created intermediaries turn act another through chain cause effect produce desired result
reality these intermediary agents act merely conduit god's own action
especially significant development islamic philosophy portrayed first cause unmoved mover aristotelian philosophy compatible concept god according islamic revelation
epistemology ancient greek philosophers such plato aristotle become highly revered medieval islamic world
al-kindi theorized there separate incorporeal universal intellect known first intellect
first god's creation intermediary through other things came creation
aside obvious metaphysical importance also crucial al-kindi's epistemology influenced platonic realism
according plato everything exists material world corresponds certain universal forms heavenly realm
these forms really abstract concepts such species quality relation apply physical objects beings
example red apple quality redness derived appropriate universal
however al-kindi says human intellects potentially able comprehend these
potential actualized first intellect perpetually thinking universals
argues external agency intellect necessary saying human beings cannot arrive universal concept merely through perception
other words intellect cannot understand species thing simply examining instances
according will yield inferior sensible form universal form desire
universal form attained through contemplation actualization first intellect
analogy provides explain theory wood fire
wood argues potentially hot just human potentially thinking universal therefore requires something else already hot such fire actualize
means human intellect think something first intellect must already thinking
therefore says first intellect must thinking everything
once human intellect comprehends universal process becomes part individual's acquired intellect thought whenever she wishes
soul afterlife al-kindi says soul simple immaterial substance related material world because faculties operate through physical body
explain nature our worldly existence borrowing epictetus compares ship during course ocean voyage temporarily anchored itself island allowed passengers disembark
implicit warning those passengers linger too long island may left behind ship sets sail again
here al-kindi displays stoic concept must become attached material things represented island will invariably taken away us ship sets sail again
then connects neo-platonist idea saying our soul directed towards pursuit desire pursuit intellect former will tie body body dies will also die latter will free body allow survive light creator realm pure intelligence
relationship revelation philosophy view al-kindi prophecy philosophy two different routes arrive truth
contrasts two positions four ways
firstly while person must undergo long period training study become philosopher prophecy bestowed upon someone god
secondly philosopher must arrive truth own devices great difficulty whereas prophet truth revealed god
thirdly understanding prophet being divinely revealed clearer comprehensive philosopher
fourthly way prophet able express understanding ordinary people superior
therefore al-kindi says prophet superior two fields ease certainty receives truth way presents
however crucial implication content prophet's philosopher's knowledge same
says adamson demonstrates how limited superiority al-kindi afforded prophecy
addition al-kindi adopted naturalistic view prophetic visions
argued through faculty imagination conceived aristotelian philosophy certain pure well-prepared souls able receive information future events
significantly does attribute such visions dreams revelation god instead explains imagination enables human beings receive form something without needing perceive physical entity refers
therefore seem imply anyone purified themselves able receive such visions
precisely idea amongst other naturalistic explanations prophetic miracles al-ghazali attacks incoherence philosophers
critics patrons while al-kindi appreciated usefulness philosophy answering questions religious nature there many islamic thinkers enthusiastic potential
incorrect assume opposed philosophy simply because foreign science
oliver leaman expert islamic philosophy points out objections notable theologians rarely directed philosophy itself rather conclusions philosophers arrived
even al-ghazali famous critique philosophers himself expert philosophy logic
criticism arrived theologically erroneous conclusions
three most serious these view believing co-eternity universe god denying bodily resurrection asserting god knowledge abstract universals particular things philosophers subscribed these same views
during life al-kindi fortunate enough enjoy patronage pro-mutazilite caliphs al-ma'mun al-mu'tasim meant carry out philosophical speculations relative ease
own time al-kindi criticized extolling intellect being most immanent creation proximity god commonly held position angels
also engaged disputations mutazilites whom attacked their belief atoms
real role al-kindi conflict philosophers theologians prepare ground debate
works says deborah black contained seeds future controversy fully realized al-ghazali's incoherence philosophers
