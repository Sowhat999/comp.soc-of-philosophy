major concepts return freud lacan's return freud emphasizes renewed attention original texts freud included radical critique ego psychology whereas lacan's quarrel object relations psychoanalysis muted affair
here attempted restore notion object relation
capital experience legitimately belongs building upon termed hesitant controlled work melanie klein
through her know function imaginary primordial enclosure formed imago mother's body well upon notion transitional object introduced
key-point explanation genesis fetishism
nevertheless lacan systematically questioned those psychoanalytic developments 1930 s 1970 s increasingly almost exclusively focused child's early relations mother
pre-oedipal kleinian mother lacan's rereading freud—characteristically lacan insists return freud supplies valid model—formed basic conceptual starting-point oppositional strategy
lacan thought freud's ideas slips tongue jokes interpretation dreams emphasized agency language subjective constitution
agency letter unconscious reason since freud proposes unconscious structured like language
unconscious primitive archetypal part mind separate conscious linguistic ego explained rather formation complex structurally sophisticated consciousness itself
consequence idea unconscious structured like language self denied any point reference restored following trauma crisis identity
andré green objected you read freud obvious proposition doesn't work minute
freud very clearly opposes unconscious says constituted thing-presentations nothing else pre-conscious
related language belong pre-conscious
freud certainly contrasted presentation word presentation thing
unconscious presentation presentation thing alone metapsychology
however dylan evans dictionary lacanian psychoanalysis
takes issue those like andré green question linguistic aspect unconscious emphasizing lacan's distinction das ding die sache freud's account thing-presentation
green's criticism lacan also included accusations intellectual dishonesty [he] cheated everybody… return freud excuse just meant going lacan
mirror stage main article mirror stage lacan's first official contribution psychoanalysis mirror stage described formative function revealed psychoanalytic experience
early 1950 s came regard mirror stage moment life infant instead formed part permanent structure subjectivity
imaginary order their own image permanently catches captivates subject
lacan explains mirror stage phenomenon assign twofold value
first place historical value marks decisive turning-point mental development child
second place typifies essential libidinal relationship body-image
concept developed further stress fell less historical value structural value
fourth seminar relation d'objet lacan states mirror stage far mere phenomenon occurs development child
illustrates conflictual nature dual relationship
mirror stage describes formation ego via process objectification ego being result conflict one's perceived visual appearance one's emotional experience
identification lacan called alienation
six months baby still lacks physical co-ordination
child able recognize themselves mirror prior attainment control over their bodily movements
child sees their image whole synthesis image produces sense contrast lack co-ordination body perceived fragmented body
child experiences contrast initially rivalry their image because wholeness image threatens child fragmentation—thus mirror stage gives rise aggressive tension subject image
resolve aggressive tension child identifies image primary identification counterpart forms ego
lacan understands moment identification moment jubilation since leads imaginary sense mastery yet child compares their own precarious sense mastery omnipotence mother depressive reaction may accompany jubilation
lacan calls specular image orthopaedic since leads child anticipate overcoming real specific prematurity birth
vision body integrated contained opposition child's actual experience motor incapacity sense her body fragmented induces movement insufficiency anticipation
other words mirror image initiates then aids like crutch process formation integrated sense self
mirror stage misunderstanding méconnaissance constitutes ego—the me moi becomes alienated itself through introduction imaginary dimension subject
mirror stage also significant symbolic dimension due presence figure adult carries infant
having jubilantly assumed image their own child turns their head towards adult represents big other call adult ratify image
other/other while freud uses term other referring andere other person das andere otherness under influence alexandre kojève lacan's use closer hegel's
lacan often used algebraic symbology concepts big other designated french autre little other designated italicized french autre
asserts awareness distinction fundamental analytic practice analyst must imbued difference situate himself place other other
dylan evans explains little other other really other reflection projection ego
evans adds reason symbol represent both objet ego schema l
simultaneously counterpart specular image
little other thus entirely inscribed imaginary order
big other designates radical alterity other-ness transcends illusory otherness imaginary because cannot assimilated through identification
lacan equates radical alterity language law hence big other inscribed order symbolic
indeed big other symbolic insofar particularized each subject
other thus both another subject radical alterity unassimilable uniqueness also symbolic order mediates relationship other subject
lacan other must first considered locus speech constituted other another subject secondary other symbolic order
speak other subject secondary sense subject occupies position thereby embodies other another subject
arguing speech originates ego nor subject rather other lacan stresses speech language beyond subject's conscious control
come another place outside consciousness—the unconscious discourse other
conceiving other place lacan refers freud's concept psychical locality unconscious described other scene
mother first occupies position big other child dylan evans explains she receives child's primitive cries retroactively sanctions them particular message
castration complex formed child discovers other complete because there lack manque other
means there signifier missing trove signifiers constituted other
lacan illustrates incomplete other graphically striking bar through symbol hence another name castrated incomplete other barred other
phallus feminist thinkers both utilised criticised lacan's concepts castration phallus
feminists such avital ronell jane gallop elizabeth grosz interpreted lacan's work opening up new possibilities feminist theory
feminists argued lacan's phallocentric analysis provides useful means understanding gender biases imposed roles while other feminist critics most notably luce irigaray accuse lacan maintaining sexist tradition psychoanalysis
irigaray phallus does define single axis gender presence/absence instead gender two positive poles
like irigaray french philosopher jacques derrida criticizing lacan's concept castration discusses phallus chiasmus hymen both other
three orders imaginary main article imaginary psychoanalysis imaginary field images imagination deception
main illusions order synthesis autonomy duality similarity
lacan thought relationship created within mirror stage ego reflected image means ego imaginary order itself places radical alienation alienation constitutive imaginary order
relationship also narcissistic
four fundamental concepts psychoanalysis lacan argues symbolic order structures visual field imaginary means involves linguistic dimension
signifier foundation symbolic signified signification part imaginary order
language symbolic imaginary connotations—in imaginary aspect language wall language inverts distorts discourse other
other hand imaginary rooted subject's relationship her own body image body
fetishism symbolic imaginary real lacan argues sexual plane imaginary appears sexual display courtship love
insofar identification analyst objective analysis lacan accused major psychoanalytic schools reducing practice psychoanalysis imaginary order
instead lacan proposes use symbolic dislodge disabling fixations imaginary—the analyst transforms images words
use symbolic argued way analytic process cross plane identification
symbolic main article symbolic seminar iv relation d'objet lacan argues concepts law structure unthinkable without language—thus symbolic linguistic dimension
order equivalent language however since language involves imaginary real well
dimension proper language symbolic signifier—that dimension elements no positive existence constituted virtue their mutual differences
symbolic also field radical alterity—that other unconscious discourse other
realm law regulates desire oedipus complex
symbolic domain culture opposed imaginary order nature
important elements symbolic concepts death lack manque connive make pleasure principle regulator distance thing das ding sich death drive goes beyond pleasure principle means repetition—the death drive mask symbolic order
working symbolic order analyst able produce changes subjective position analysand
these changes will produce imaginary effects because imaginary structured symbolic
real main article real lacan's concept real dates back 1936 doctoral thesis psychosis
term popular time particularly émile meyerson referred ontological absolute true being-in-itself
lacan returned theme real 1953 continued develop until death
real lacan synonymous reality
opposed imaginary real also exterior symbolic
unlike latter constituted terms oppositions
presence/absence there no absence real
whereas symbolic opposition presence/absence implies possibility something may missing symbolic real place
symbolic set differentiated elements signifiers real itself undifferentiated—it bears no fissure
symbolic introduces cut real process signification world words creates world things—things originally confused here now process coming being
real outside language resists symbolization absolutely
seminar xi lacan defines real impossible because impossible imagine impossible integrate symbolic impossible attain
resistance symbolization lends real traumatic quality
finally real object anxiety insofar lacks any possible mediation essential object object any longer something faced words cease categories fail object anxiety par excellence
desire lacan's concept desire related hegel's begierde term implies continuous force therefore somehow differs freud's concept wunsch
lacan's desire refers unconscious desire because unconscious desire forms central concern psychoanalysis
aim psychoanalysis lead analysand recognize his/her desire doing uncover truth his/her desire
however possible desire articulated speech once formulated named presence other desire appears full sense term
again ego freud's theory technique psychoanalysis
important teach subject name articulate bring desire existence
subject should come recognize name his/his desire
isn't question recognizing something entirely given
naming subject creates brings forth new presence world
truth desire somehow present discourse although discourse never able articulate entire truth desire whenever discourse attempts articulate desire there leftover surplus
lacan distinguishes desire need demand
need biological instinct subject depends other satisfy own needs order get other's help need must articulated demand
presence other ensures satisfaction need also represents other's love
consequently demand acquires double function hand articulates need other acts demand love
even after need articulated demand satisfied demand love remains unsatisfied since other cannot provide unconditional love subject seeks
desire neither appetite satisfaction nor demand love difference results subtraction first second
desire surplus leftover produced articulation need demand desire begins take shape margin demand becomes separated need
unlike need satisfied desire never satisfied constant pressure eternal
attainment desire does consist being fulfilled reproduction such
slavoj žižek puts desire's raison d'être realize goal find full satisfaction reproduce itself desire
lacan also distinguishes desire drives desire drives many
drives partial manifestations single force called desire
lacan's concept objet petit object desire although object towards desire tends rather cause desire
desire relation object relation lack manque
four fundamental concepts psychoanalysis lacan argues man's desire desire other
entails following desire desire other's desire meaning desire object another's desire desire also desire recognition
here lacan follows alexandre kojève follows hegel kojève subject must risk own life wants achieve desired prestige
desire object another's desire best exemplified oedipus complex subject desires phallus mother
subversion subject dialectic desire freudian unconscious
lacan contends subject desires point view another whereby object someone's desire object desired another makes object desirable precisely desired someone else
again lacan follows kojève follows hegel
aspect desire present hysteria hysteric someone converts another's desire his/her own see sigmund freud's fragment analysis case hysteria se vii dora desires frau k because she identifies herr k
matters then analysis hysteric find out object her desire discover subject whom she identifies
désir de l'autre translated desire other though also desire other
fundamental desire incestuous desire mother primordial other
desire desire something else since impossible desire already object desire continually deferred why desire metonymy
desire appears field other unconscious
last least lacan first person occupies place other mother first child her mercy
father articulates desire law castrating mother subject liberated mother's desire
drive lacan maintains freud's distinction drive trieb instinct instinkt
drives differ biological needs because never satisfied aim object rather circle perpetually around
argues purpose drive triebziel reach goal follow aim meaning way itself instead final destination circle around object
purpose drive return circular path true source jouissance repetitive movement closed circuit
lacan posits drives both cultural symbolic constructs—to drive given something archaic primordial
incorporates four elements drives defined freud pressure end object source theory drive's circuit drive originates erogenous zone circles round object returns erogenous zone
three grammatical voices structure circuit active voice see reflexive voice see oneself passive voice seen active reflexive voices autoerotic—they lack subject
drive completes circuit passive voice new subject appears implying prior instance there subject
despite being passive voice drive essentially active make oneself seen rather seen
circuit drive way subject transgress pleasure principle
freud sexuality composed partial drives
oral anal drives each specified different erotogenic zone
first these partial drives function independently
polymorphous perversity children puberty become organized under aegis genital organs
lacan accepts partial nature drives rejects notion partial drives ever attain any complete organization primacy genital zone achieved precarious 2 argues drives partial represent sexuality partially sense part whole
drives represent reproductive function sexuality dimension jouissance
lacan identifies four partial drives oral drive erogenous zones lips partial object breast verb suck anal drive anus faeces shit scopic drive eyes gaze see invocatory drive ears voice hear
first two drives relate demand last two desire
notion dualism maintained throughout freud's various reformulations drive-theory
initial opposition sexual drives ego-drives self-preservation final life drives lebenstriebe death drives todestriebe
lacan retains freud's dualism terms opposition symbolic imaginary referred different kinds drives
lacan drives sexual drives every drive death drive pulsion de mort since every drive excessive repetitive destructive
drives closely related desire since both originate field subject
confused drives partial aspects desire realized—desire undivided whereas drives partial manifestations
drive demand caught up dialectical mediation desire drive mechanical insistence ensnared demand dialectical mediation
other concepts name father foreclosure psychoanalysis lack manque objet petit graph desire matheme sinthome four discourses lacan error knowledge building freud's psychopathology everyday life lacan long argued every unsuccessful act successful say 'well-turned' discourse highlighting well sudden transformations errors truths seemed due nothing perseverance
late seminar generalised fully psychoanalytic discovery truth—arising misunderstanding maintain subject naturally erring
discourse structures alone give moorings reference points signs identify orient neglects forgets loses them condemned err anew
because alienation speaking beings subjected due their being language survive must let oneself taken signs become dupe discourse
[of] fictions organized discourse
lacan masculine knowledge irredeemably erring individual must thus allow himself fooled these signs chance getting bearings amidst them must place maintain himself wake discourse
become dupe discourse
les non-dupes errent
lacan comes close here points very occasionally sounds like thomas kuhn whom never mentions lacan's discourse resembling kuhn's paradigm seen entire constellation beliefs values techniques shared members given community
clinical contributions variable-length session variable-length psychoanalytic session lacan's crucial clinical innovations key element conflicts ipa whom innovation reducing fifty-minute analytic hour delphic seven eight minutes sometimes even single oracular parole murmured waiting-room unacceptable
lacan's variable-length sessions lasted anywhere few minutes even deemed appropriate analyst few seconds several hours
[citation needed] practice replaced classical freudian fifty minute hour
respect called cutting up 'timing' lacan asked question why make intervention impossible point consequently privileged way? allowing analyst's intervention timing variable-length session removed patient's—or technically analysand's—former certainty length time couch
lacan adopted practice psychoanalytic establishment scandalized—and given 1979 1980 saw average ten patients hour perhaps hard see why psychoanalysis reduced zero no less lucrative
time original innovation lacan described issue concerning systematic use shorter sessions certain analyses particular training analyses practice certainly shortening session around so-called critical moment took place critics 'everyone well aware meant deceptive phrase variable length
sessions systematically reduced just few minutes'
irrespective theoretical merits breaking up patients' expectations clear lacanian analyst never wants 'shake up' routine keeping them rather less time
whatever justification practical effects startling
does take cynic point out lacan able take many analysands anyone using classical freudian techniques
[and] technique adopted pupils followers almost exponential rate growth became possible
accepting importance critical moment insight arises object relations theory nonetheless quietly suggest analyst does provide patient space nothing needs happen there no space something happen
julia kristeva very different language concur lacan alert scandal timeless intrinsic analytic experience mistaken wanting ritualize technique scansion short sessions
writings writing style most lacan's psychoanalytic writings forties through early sixties compiled index concepts jacques-alain miller 1966 collection titled simply écrits
published french éditions du seuil later issued two-volume set 1970/1 new preface
selection writings chosen lacan himself translated alan sheridan published tavistock press 1977
full 35-text volume appeared first time english bruce fink's translation published norton & co
écrits included list 100 most influential books 20 th century compiled polled broadsheet le monde
lacan's writings late sixties seventies thus subsequent 1966 collection collected posthumously along early texts nineteen thirties éditions du seuil volume autres écrits 2001
although most texts écrits autres écrits closely related lacan's lectures lessons seminar often style denser lacan's oral delivery clear distinction writings transcriptions oral teaching evident reader
jacques-alain miller sole editor lacan's seminars contain majority life's work
there considerable controversy over accuracy otherwise transcription editing well over miller's refusal allow any critical annotated edition published
despite lacan's status major figure history psychoanalysis seminars remain unpublished
since 1984 miller regularly conducting series lectures l'orientation lacanienne
miller's teachings published us journal lacanian ink
lacan's writing notoriously difficult due part repeated hegelian/kojèvean allusions wide theoretical divergences other psychoanalytic philosophical theory obscure prose style
impenetrability lacan's prose
[is] too often regarded profundity precisely because cannot understood
arguably least imitation style other 'lacanian' commentators resulted obscurantist antisystematic tradition lacanian literature
though major influence psychoanalysis france parts latin america lacan's influence clinical psychology english-speaking world negligible ideas best known arts humanities
however there lacanian psychoanalytic societies both north america united kingdom carry work
example lacan's work being practiced united states found works annie g
rogers shining affliction unsayable hidden language trauma credit lacanian theory many therapeutic insights successfully treating sexually abused young women
lacan's work also reached quebec interdisciplinary freudian group research clinical cultural interventions gifric claims used modified form lacanian psychoanalysis successfully treating psychosis many patients task once thought unsuited psychoanalysis even psychoanalysts themselves
criticism fashionable nonsense 1997 alan sokal jean bricmont criticize lacan's use terms mathematical fields such topology accusing superficial erudition abusing scientific concepts does understand
however note want enter debate over purely psychoanalytic part lacan's work
other critics dismissed lacan's work wholesale
françois roustang called incoherent system pseudo-scientific gibberish quoted linguist noam chomsky's opinion lacan amusing perfectly self-conscious charlatan
former lacanian analyst dylan evans eventually dismissed lacanianism lacking sound scientific basis harming rather helping patients criticized lacan's followers treating writings holy writ
richard webster decried sees lacan's obscurity arrogance resultant cult lacan
others forceful still describing shrink hell listing many associates—from lovers family colleagues patients editors—left damaged wake
type charismatic authority linked many conflicts among followers analytic schools involved
intellectual style also come much criticism
eclectic use sources lacan seen concealing own thought behind apparent explication others
thus return freud called malcolm bowie complete pattern dissenting assent ideas freud
lacan's argument conducted freud's behalf same time against
bowie also suggested lacan suffered both love system deep-seated opposition forms system
lacan similarly seen trapped very phallocentric mastery language ostensibly sought undermine
result—castoriadis maintain—was make thought depend upon himself thus stifle capacity independent thought among those around
their difficulties reinforced didier anzieu described kind teasing lure lacan's discourse fundamental truths revealed
further point
perhaps aspect sadistic narcissism feminists especially detected nature
though many narcissist indulging omnipotent fantasies through systems thought lacan seen example michael maccoby called productive narcissist those through their power draw others their visions eventually changed very parameters our cultural world
