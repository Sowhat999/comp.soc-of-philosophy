studying germany boas awarded doctorate 1881 physics while also studying geography
then participated geographical expedition northern canada became fascinated culture language baffin island inuit
went field work indigenous cultures languages pacific northwest
1887 emigrated united states first worked museum curator smithsonian 1899 became professor anthropology columbia university remained rest career
through students many whom went found anthropology departments research programmes inspired their mentor boas profoundly influenced development american anthropology

boas most prominent opponents then popular ideologies scientific racism idea race biological concept human behavior best understood through typology biological characteristics
series groundbreaking studies skeletal anatomy showed cranial shape size highly malleable depending environmental factors such health nutrition contrast claims racial anthropologists day held head shape stable racial trait
boas also worked demonstrate differences human behavior primarily determined innate biological dispositions largely result cultural differences acquired through social learning
way boas introduced culture primary concept describing differences behavior human groups central analytical concept anthropology
among boas's main contributions anthropological thought rejection then popular evolutionary approaches study culture saw societies progressing through set hierarchic technological cultural stages western-european culture summit
boas argued culture developed historically through interactions groups people diffusion ideas consequently there no process towards continuously higher cultural forms
insight led boas reject stage-based organization ethnological museums instead preferring order items display based affinity proximity cultural groups question
boas also introduced ideology cultural relativism holds cultures cannot objectively ranked higher lower better correct humans see world through lens their own culture judge according their own culturally acquired norms

although grandparents observant jews parents embraced enlightenment values including their assimilation modern german society
boas's parents educated well-to-do liberal like dogma any kind
due boas granted independence think himself pursue own interests
early life displayed penchant both nature natural sciences
boas vocally opposed anti-semitism refused convert christianity identify himself jew indeed according biographer 'ethnic' german preserving promoting german culture values america
autobiographical sketch boas background my early thinking german home ideals revolution 1848 living force
my father liberal active public affairs my mother idealistic lively interest public matters founder 1854 kindergarten my home town devoted science
my parents broken through shackles dogma
my father retained emotional affection ceremonial parental home without allowing influence intellectual freedom
kindergarten boas educated natural history subject enjoyed
gymnasium most proud research geographic distribution plants
started university studies boas first attended heidelberg university semester followed four terms bonn university studying physics geography mathematics these schools
1879 hoped transfer berlin university study physics under hermann von helmholtz ended up transferring university kiel instead due family reasons
kiel boas studied under theobald fischer received doctorate physics 1881 dissertation entitled contributions understanding color water examined absorption reflection polarization light seawater
although technically boas' doctorate degree physics advisor fischer student carl ritter primarily geographer thus biographers view boas geographer physicist stage
combination physics geography also may accomplished through major physics minor geography
part boas self-identified geographer time prompting sister toni write 1883 after long years infidelity my brother re-conquered geography first love boyhood
dissertation research boas' methodology included investigating how different intensities light created different colors interacting different types water however encountered difficulty being able objectively perceive slight differences color water result became intrigued problem perception influence quantitative measurements
boas already interested kantian philosophy since taking course aesthetics kuno fischer heidelberg
these factors led boas consider pursuing research psychophysics explores relationship psychological physical after completing doctorate no training psychology
boas publish six articles psychophysics during year military service 1882-1883 ultimately decided focus geography primarily receive sponsorship planned baffin island expedition
post-graduate studies boas took up geography way explore growing interest relationship subjective experience objective world
time german geographers divided over causes cultural variation
many argued physical environment principal determining factor others notably friedrich ratzel argued diffusion ideas through human migration important
1883 encouraged theobald fischer boas went baffin island conduct geographic research impact physical environment native inuit migrations
first many ethnographic field trips boas culled notes write first monograph titled central eskimo published 6 th annual report bureau american ethnology 1888
boas lived worked closely inuit peoples baffin island developed abiding interest way people lived
perpetual darkness arctic winter boas reported traveling companion became lost forced keep sledding twenty-six hours through ice soft snow temperatures dropped below −46 °c
following day boas penciled diary33 often ask myself advantages our 'good society' possesses over 'savages' find see their customs no right look down upon them
no right blame them their forms superstitions may seem ridiculous us
'highly educated people' much worse relatively speaking
— franz boas marie krackowizer 23 december 1883 boas went explain same entry service therefore man perform humanity must serve promote truth
boas forced depend various inuit groups everything directions food shelter companionship
difficult year filled tremendous hardships included frequent bouts disease mistrust pestilence danger
boas successfully searched areas yet surveyed found unique ethnographic objects long winter lonely treks across perilous terrain forced search soul find direction life scientist citizen
[citation needed] boas's interest indigenous communities grew worked royal ethnological museum berlin introduced members nuxalk nation british columbia sparked lifelong relationship first nations pacific northwest
returned berlin complete studies
1886 boas defended helmholtz's support habilitation thesis baffin land named privatdozent geography
while baffin island began develop interest studying non-western cultures resulting book central eskimo published 1888
1885 boas went work physical anthropologist rudolf virchow ethnologist adolf bastian royal ethnological museum berlin
boas studied anatomy virchow two years earlier while preparing baffin island expedition
time virchow involved vociferous debate over evolution former student ernst haeckel
haeckel abandoned medical practice study comparative anatomy after reading charles darwin's origin species vigorously promoted darwin's ideas germany
however like most other natural scientists prior rediscovery mendelian genetics 1900 development modern synthesis virchow felt darwin's theories weak because lacked theory cellular mutability
accordingly virchow favored lamarckian models evolution
debate resonated debates among geographers
lamarckians believed environmental forces precipitate rapid enduring changes organisms no inherited source thus lamarckians environmental determinists often found themselves same side debates
boas worked closely bastian noted antipathy environmental determinism
instead argued psychic unity mankind belief humans same intellectual capacity cultures based same basic mental principles
variations custom belief argued products historical accidents
view resonated boas's experiences baffin island drew towards anthropology
while royal ethnological museum boas became interested native americans pacific northwest after defending habilitation thesis left three-month trip british columbia via new york
january 1887 offered job assistant editor journal science

many others however—including boas's student alexander lesser later researchers such marian w
smith herbert s
lewis matti bunzl—have pointed out boas explicitly rejected physics favor history model anthropological research
distinction science history origins 19 th-century german academe distinguished naturwissenschaften sciences geisteswissenschaften humanities gesetzwissenschaften jurisprudence geschichtswissenschaften history historiography
generally naturwissenschaften gesetzwissenschaften refer study phenomena governed objective natural laws while latter terms two oppositions refer those phenomena meaning terms human perception experience
1884 kantian philosopher wilhelm windelband coined terms nomothetic idiographic describe these two divergent approaches
observed most scientists employ mix both differing proportions considered physics perfect example nomothetic science history idiographic science
moreover argued each approach origin two interests reason kant identified critique judgement—one generalizing other specifying
winkelband's student heinrich rickert elaborated distinction limits concept formation natural science logical introduction historical sciences boas's students alfred kroeber edward sapir relied extensively work defining their own approach anthropology
although kant considered these two interests reason objective universal distinction natural human sciences institutionalized germany through organization scholarly research teaching following enlightenment
germany enlightenment dominated kant himself sought establish principles based universal rationality
reaction kant german scholars such johann gottfried herder argued human creativity necessarily takes unpredictable highly diverse forms important human rationality
1795 great linguist philosopher wilhelm von humboldt called anthropology synthesize kant's herder's interests
humboldt founded university berlin 1809 work geography history psychology provided milieu boas's intellectual orientation matured
historians working humboldtian tradition developed ideas become central boasian anthropology
leopold von ranke defined task historian merely show actually cornerstone boas's empiricism
wilhelm dilthey emphasized centrality understanding human knowledge lived experience historian provide basis empathic understanding situation historical actor
boas both values well-expressed quote goethe single action event interesting because explainable because true
[citation needed] influence these ideas boas apparent 1887 essay study geography distinguished physical science seeks discover laws governing phenomena historical science seeks thorough understanding phenomena their own terms
boas argued geography must historical sense
1887 after baffin island expedition boas principles ethnological classification developed argument application anthropology ethnological phenomena result physical psychical character men development under influence surroundings
'surroundings' physical conditions country sociological phenomena
relation man man
furthermore study present surroundings insufficient history people influence regions through passed migrations people whom came contact must considered boas stocking 1989
formulation echoes ratzel's focus historical processes human migration culture contact bastian's rejection environmental determinism
also emphasizes culture context surroundings importance history
these hallmarks boasian anthropology marvin harris later call historical-particularism guide boas's research over next decade well instructions future students
see lewis 2001 alternative view harris'
although context history essential elements boas's understanding anthropology geisteswissenschaften geschichtswissenschaften there essential element boasian anthropology shares naturwissenschaften empiricism
1949 boas's student alfred kroeber summed up principles empiricism define boasian anthropology science method science begin questions answers least value judgements
science dispassionate inquiry therefore cannot take over outright any ideologies already formulated everyday life since these themselves inevitably traditional normally tinged emotional prejudice
sweeping all-or-none black-and-white judgements characteristic categorical attitudes no place science whose very nature inferential judicious
orthogenetic versus darwinian evolution greatest accomplishments boas students their critique theories physical social cultural evolution current time
critique central boas's work museums well work four fields anthropology
historian george stocking noted however boas's main project distinguish biological cultural heredity focus cultural processes believed greatest influence over social life
fact boas supported darwinian theory although assume automatically applied cultural historical phenomena indeed lifelong opponent 19 th-century theories cultural evolution such those lewis h
morgan edward burnett tylor
notion evolution boasians ridiculed rejected then dominant belief orthogenesis—a determinate teleological process evolution change occurs progressively regardless natural selection
boas rejected prevalent theories social evolution developed edward burnett tylor lewis henry morgan herbert spencer because rejected notion evolution per se because rejected orthogenetic notions evolution favor darwinian evolution
difference these prevailing theories cultural evolution darwinian theory cannot overstated orthogeneticists argued societies progress through same stages same sequence
thus although inuit whom boas worked baffin island germans whom studied graduate student contemporaries another evolutionists argued inuit earlier stage their evolution germans later stage
echoed popular misreading darwin suggested human beings descended chimpanzees
fact darwin argued chimpanzees humans equally evolved
characterizes darwinian theory attention processes species transforms another adaptation key principle explaining relationship species environment natural selection mechanism change
contrast morgan spencer tylor little say process mechanics change
furthermore darwin built up theory through careful examination considerable empirical data
boasian research revealed virtually every claim made cultural evolutionists contradicted data reflected profound misinterpretation data
boas's student robert lowie remarked contrary misleading statements subject there no responsible opponents evolution 'scientifically proved' though there determined hostility evolutionary metaphysics falsifies established facts
unpublished lecture boas characterized debt darwin thus although idea does appear quite definitely expressed darwin's discussion development mental powers seems quite clear main object express conviction mental faculties developed essentially without purposive end originated variations continued natural selection
idea also brought out very clearly wallace emphasized apparently reasonable activities man might very well developed without actual application reasoning
thus boas suggested appear patterns structures culture product conscious design rather outcome diverse mechanisms produce cultural variation such diffusion independent invention shaped social environment people live act
boas concluded lecture acknowledging importance darwin's work hope may succeeded presenting you however imperfectly currents thought due work immortal darwin helped make anthropology present time

boas focused kwakiutl lived two clusters
kwakiutl seemed mix features
prior marriage man assume wife's father's name crest
children took these names crests well although sons lose them got married
names crests thus stayed mother's line

1907 essay anthropology boas identified two basic questions anthropologists why tribes nations world different how present differences developed? amplifying these questions explained object anthropological study thus discuss anatomical physiological mental characteristics man considered individual interested diversity these traits groups men found different geographical areas different social classes
our task inquire causes brought observed differentiation investigate sequence events led establishment multifarious forms human life
other words interested anatomical mental characteristics men living under same biological geographical social environment determined their past
these questions signal marked break then-current ideas human diversity assumed people history evident historical written record while other people lacking writing also lack history
distinction two different kinds societies explained difference history sociology economics other disciplines focus people writing anthropology supposed focus people without writing
boas rejected distinction kinds societies division labor academy
understood societies history societies proper objects anthropological society
order approach literate non-literate societies same way emphasized importance studying human history through analysis other things besides written texts
thus 1904 article history anthropology boas historical development work anthropologists seems single out clearly domain knowledge heretofore treated any other science
biological history mankind varieties linguistics applied people without written languages ethnology people without historic records prehistoric archeology
historians social theorists 18 th 19 th centuries speculated causes differentiation boas dismissed these theories especially dominant theories social evolution cultural evolution speculative
endeavored establish discipline base claims rigorous empirical study
boas's most important books mind primitive man 1911 integrated theories concerning history development cultures established program dominate american anthropology next fifteen years
study established any given population biology language material symbolic culture autonomous each equally important dimension human nature no these dimensions reducible another
other words established culture does depend any independent variables

physical anthropology boas's work physical anthropology brought together interest darwinian evolution interest migration cause change
most important research field study changes body form among children immigrants new york
other researchers already noted differences height cranial measurements other physical features americans people different parts europe
many used these differences argue there innate biological difference races
boas's primary interest—in symbolic material culture language—was study processes change therefore set out determine whether bodily forms also subject processes change
boas studied 17821 people divided seven ethno-national groups
boas found average measures cranial size immigrants significantly different members these groups born united states
moreover discovered average measures cranial size children born within ten years their mothers' arrival significantly different those children born ten years after their mothers' arrival
boas deny physical features such height cranial size inherited however argue environment influence these features expressed through change over time
work central influential argument differences races immutable
these findings radical time continue debated
2002 anthropologists corey s
sparks richard l
jantz claimed differences children born same parents europe america very small insignificant there no detectable effect exposure american environment cranial index children
argued their results contradicted boas's original findings demonstrated may no longer used support arguments plasticity cranial morphology
however jonathan marks—a well-known physical anthropologist former president general anthropology section american anthropological association—has remarked revisionist study boas's work ring desperation obfuscation quickly rebutted mainstream biological anthropology
2003 anthropologists clarence c
gravlee h
russell bernard william r
leonard reanalyzed boas's data concluded most boas's original findings correct
moreover applied new statistical computer-assisted methods boas's data discovered evidence cranial plasticity
later publication gravlee bernard leonard reviewed sparks jantz's analysis
argue sparks jantz misrepresented boas's claims sparks's jantz's data actually support boas
example point out sparks jantz look changes cranial size relation how long individual united states order test influence environment
boas however looked changes cranial size relation how long mother united states
argue boas's method useful because prenatal environment crucial developmental factor
further publication jantz based gravlee et al
claims boas cherry picked two groups immigrants sicilians hebrews varied most towards same mean discarded other groups varied opposite direction
commented using recent reanalysis gravlee et al
2003 observe figure 2 maximum difference cranial index due immigration hebrews much smaller maximum ethnic difference sicilians bohemians
shows long headed parents produce long headed offspring vice versa
make argument children immigrants converge onto american type required boas use two groups changed most
although sociobiologists evolutionary psychologists suggested boas opposed darwinian evolution boas fact committed proponent darwinian evolutionary thought
1888 declared development ethnology largely due general recognition principle biological evolution since boas's times physical anthropologists established human capacity culture product human evolution
fact boas's research changes body form played important role rise darwinian theory
crucial remember boas trained time biologists no understanding genetics mendelian genetics became widely known after 1900
prior time biologists relied measurement physical traits empirical data any theory evolution
boas's biometric studies however led question use method kind data
speech anthropologists berlin 1912 boas argued best such statistics raise biological questions answer them
context anthropologists began turning genetics basis any understanding biological variation
linguistics boas also contributed greatly foundation linguistics science united states
published many descriptive studies native american languages theoretical difficulties classifying languages laid out research program studying relations language culture students such edward sapir paul rivet alfred kroeber followed
1889 article alternating sounds however made singular contribution methodology both linguistics cultural anthropology
response paper presented 1888 daniel garrison brinton time professor american linguistics archeology university pennsylvania
brinton observed spoken languages many native americans certain sounds regularly alternated
clearly function individual accents brinton suggesting individuals pronounced certain words differently others
arguing there many words even repeated same speaker varied considerably their vocalization
using evolutionary theory brinton argued pervasive inconsistency sign linguistic inferiority evidence native americans low stage their evolution
boas familiar brinton talking experienced something similar during research baffin island pacific northwest
nevertheless argued alternating sounds feature native american languages—indeed argued really exist
rather take alternating sounds objective proof different stages cultural evolution boas considered them terms longstanding interest subjective perception objective physical phenomena
also considered earlier critique evolutionary museum displays
there pointed out two things artefacts material culture appear similar may fact quite different
article raises possibility two things sounds appear different may fact same
short shifted attention perception different sounds
boas begins raising empirical question people describe sound different ways because cannot perceive difference might there another reason? immediately establishes concerned cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent color-blindness
points out question people describe sound different ways comparable people describe different sounds way
crucial research descriptive linguistics studying new language how note pronunciation different words? point boas anticipates lays groundwork distinction phonemics phonetics
people may pronounce word variety ways still recognize using same word
issue then such sensations recognized their individuality other words people recognize differences pronunciations rather sounds classified according their similarity other words people classify variety perceived sounds category
comparable visual example involve words colors
english word green used refer variety shades hues tints
there languages no word green
such cases people might classify call green either yellow blue
example color-blindness—people perceive differences color categorize similar colors different way english speakers
boas applied these principles studies inuit languages
researchers reported variety spellings given word
past researchers interpreted data number ways—it indicate local variations pronunciation word indicate different dialects
boas argues alternative explanation difference how inuit pronounce word rather how english-speaking scholars perceive pronunciation word
english speakers physically incapable perceiving sound question rather phonetic system english cannot accommodate perceived sound
although boas making very specific contribution methods descriptive linguistics ultimate point far reaching observer bias need personal cultural
other words perceptual categories western researchers may systematically cause westerner misperceive fail perceive entirely meaningful element another culture
critique otis mason's museum displays boas demonstrated appeared evidence cultural evolution really consequence unscientific methods reflection westerners' beliefs their own cultural superiority
point provides methodological foundation boas's cultural relativism elements culture meaningful culture's terms even may meaningless take radically different meaning another culture

considers every phenomena worthy being studied own sake
mere existence entitles full share our attention knowledge existence evolution space time fully satisfies student
boas's student ruth benedict gave her presidential address american anthropological association 1947 she reminded anthropologists importance idiographic stance quoting literary critic
bradley watch 'what is' seeing happened must happened
orientation led boas promote cultural anthropology characterized strong commitment empiricism resulting skepticism attempts formulate scientific laws culture notion culture fluid dynamic ethnographic fieldwork anthropologist resides extended period among people being researched conducts research native language collaborates native researchers method collecting data cultural relativism methodological tool while conducting fieldwork heuristic tool while analyzing data
boas argued order understand is—in cultural anthropology specific cultural traits behaviors beliefs symbols—one examine them their local context
also understood people migrate place another cultural context changes over time elements culture their meanings will change led emphasize importance local histories analysis cultures
although other anthropologists time such bronisław malinowski alfred reginald radcliffe-brown focused study societies understood clearly bounded boas's attention history reveals extent traits diffuse place another led view cultural boundaries multiple overlapping highly permeable
thus boas's student robert lowie once described culture thing shreds patches
boas students understood people try make sense their world seek integrate disparate elements result different cultures characterized having different configurations patterns
boasians also understood such integration tensions diffusion any appearance stable configuration contingent see bashkow 2004 445
during boas's lifetime today many westerners saw fundamental difference modern societies characterized dynamism individualism traditional societies stable homogeneous
boas's empirical field research however led argue against comparison
example 1903 essay decorative designs alaskan needlecases history conventional designs based materials u
museum provides another example how boas made broad theoretical claims based detailed analysis empirical data
after establishing formal similarities among needlecases boas shows how certain formal features provide vocabulary out individual artisans create variations design
thus emphasis culture context meaningful action made sensitive individual variation within society william henry holmes suggested similar point 1886 paper origin development form ornament ceramic art although unlike boas develop ethnographic theoretical implications
programmatic essay 1920 methods ethnology boas argued instead systematic enumeration standardized beliefs customs tribe anthropology needs document way individual reacts whole social environment difference opinion mode action occur primitive society causes far-reaching changes
boas argued attention individual agency reveals activities individual determined great extent social environment turn own activities influence society lives may bring modifications form
consequently boas thought culture fundamentally dynamic soon these methods applied primitive society loses appearance absolute stability
cultural forms rather appear constant state flux
see lewis 2001 having argued against relevance distinction literate non-literate societies way defining anthropology's object study boas argued non-literate literate societies should analyzed same way
nineteenth-century historians applying techniques philology reconstruct histories relationships literate societies
order apply these methods non-literate societies boas argued task fieldworkers produce collect texts non-literate societies
took form compiling lexicons grammars local language recording myths folktales beliefs social relationships institutions even recipes local cuisine
order boas relied heavily collaboration literate native ethnographers among kwakiutl most often george hunt urged students consider such people valuable partners inferior their standing western society superior their understanding their own culture
see bunzl 2004 438–439 using these methods boas published another article 1920 revisited earlier research kwakiutl kinship
late 1890 s boas tried reconstruct transformation organization kwakiutl clans comparing them organization clans other societies neighboring kwakiutl north south
now however argued against translating kwakiutl principle kin groups any english word
instead trying fit kwakiutl larger model tried understand their beliefs practices their own terms
example whereas earlier translated kwakiutl word numaym clan now argued word best understood referring bundle privileges there no english word
men secured claims these privileges through their parents wives there variety ways these privileges acquired used transmitted generation next
work alternating sounds boas come realize different ethnological interpretations kwakiutl kinship result limitations western categories
work alaskan needlecases now saw variation among kwakiutl practices result play social norms individual creativity
before death 1942 appointed helen codere edit publish manuscripts culture kwakiutl people
franz boas folklore franz boas immensely influential figure throughout development folklore discipline
first glance might seem concern discipline anthropology—after fought most life keep folklore part anthropology
yet boas motivated desire see both anthropology folklore become professional well-respected
boas afraid folklore allowed become own discipline standards folklore scholarship lowered
combined scholarships amateurs lead folklore completely discredited boas believed
order further professionalize folklore boas introduced strict scientific methods learned college discipline
boas championed use exhaustive research fieldwork strict scientific guidelines folklore scholarship
boas believed true theory formed thorough research even once you theory should treated work progress unless proved beyond doubt
rigid scientific methodology eventually accepted major tenets folklore scholarship boas's methods remain use even today
boas also nurtured many budding folklorists during time professor students counted among most notable minds folklore scholarship
boas passionate collection folklore believed similarity folktales amongst different folk groups due dissemination
boas strove prove theory efforts produced method breaking folktale parts then analyzing these parts
creation catch-words allowed categorization these parts ability analyze them relation other similar tales
boas also fought prove cultures progressed along same path non-european cultures particular primitive different
boas remained active development scholarship folklore throughout life

letter boas john dewey 11/6/39 boas known passionately defending believed right
during lifetime often through work boas combated racism berated anthropologists folklorists used their work cover espionage worked protect german austrian scientists fled nazi regime openly protested hitlerism
many social scientists other disciplines often agonize over legitimacy their work science consequently emphasize importance detachment objectivity abstraction quantifiability their work
perhaps because boas like other early anthropologists originally trained natural sciences students never expressed such anxiety
moreover believe detachment objectivity quantifiability required make anthropology scientific
since object study anthropologists different object study physicists assumed anthropologists employ different methods different criteria evaluating their research
thus boas used statistical studies demonstrate extent variation data context-dependent argued context-dependent nature human variation rendered many abstractions generalizations passing scientific understandings humankind especially theories social evolution popular time fact unscientific
understanding ethnographic fieldwork began fact objects ethnographic study e
inuit baffin island just objects subjects research called attention their creativity agency
importantly viewed inuit teachers thus reversing typical hierarchical relationship scientist object study
emphasis relationship anthropologists those study—the point while astronomers stars chemists elements botanists plants fundamentally different anthropologists those study equally human—implied anthropologists themselves objects anthropological study
although boas pursue reversal systematically article alternating sounds illustrates awareness scientists should confident their objectivity because too see world through prism their culture
emphasis also led boas conclude anthropologists obligation speak out social issues
boas especially concerned racial inequality research indicated biological origin rather social
boas credited first scientist publish idea people—including white african-americans—are equal
often emphasized abhorrence racism used work show there no scientific basis such bias
early example concern evident 1906 commencement address atlanta university invitation w
du bois
boas began remarking you accept view present weakness american negro uncontrollable emotions lack energy racially inherent your work still noble
then went however argue against view
claim european asian civilizations time advanced african societies boas objected against total history humankind past two thousand years brief span
moreover although technological advances our early ancestors such taming fire inventing stone tools might seem insignificant compared invention steam engine control over electricity should consider might actually even greater accomplishments
boas then went catalogue advances africa such smelting iron cultivating millet domesticating chickens cattle occurred africa well before spread europe asia evidence now suggests chickens first domesticated asia original domestication cattle under debate
then described activities african kings diplomats merchants artists evidence cultural achievement
concluded any social inferiority negroes united states cannot explained their african origins therefore claimed your race doomed economic inferiority you may confidently look home your ancestors say you set out recover colored people strength their own before set foot shores continent
you may say you go work bright hopes you will discouraged slowness your progress you recover lost transplanting negro race native soil continent you must reach higher levels your ancestors ever attained
boas proceeds discuss arguments inferiority negro race calls attention fact brought americas through force
boas just example many times conquest colonialism brought different peoples unequal relation mentions conquest england normans teutonic invasion italy [and] manchoo conquest china resulting similar conditions
best example boas phenomenon jews europe even now there lingers consciousness old sharper divisions ages able efface strong enough find—not here there—expression antipathy jewish type
france let down barriers hundred years ago feeling antipathy still strong enough sustain anti-jewish political party
boas's closing advice african-americans should look whites approval encouragement because people power usually take very long time learn sympathize people out power
remember every single case history process adaptation exceeding slowness
look impossible let your path deviate quiet steadfast insistence full opportunities your powers
despite boas's caveat intractability white prejudice also considered scientist's responsibility argue against white myths racial purity racial superiority use evidence research fight racism
boas also critical nation imposing power over others
1916 boas letter new york times published under headline why german-americans blame america
although boas begin letter protesting bitter attacks against german-americans time war europe most letter critique american nationalism
my youth taught school home love good my own country also seek understand respect individualities other nations
reason one-sided nationalism often found nowadays me unendurable
writes love american ideals freedom growing discomfort american beliefs own superiority over others
opinion no right impose our ideals upon other nations no matter how strange may seem us enjoy kind life lead how slow may utilizing resources their countries how much opposed their ideals may ours
our intolerant attitude most pronounced regard like call our free institutions
modern democracy no doubt most wholesome needed reaction against abuses absolutism selfish often corrupt bureaucracy
wishes thoughts people should find expression form government should conform these wishis axiom pervaded whole western world even taking root far east
quite different question however how far particular machinery democratic government identical democratic institutions
claim often our solution democratic ideal one-sided expression americanism
see no reason why should allow germans austrians russians whoever else may solve their problems their own ways instead demanding bestow upon themselves benefactions our regime
although boas felt scientists responsibility speak out social political problems appalled might involve themselves disingenuous deceitful ways
thus 1919 discovered four anthropologists course their research other countries serving spies american government angry letter nation
perhaps letter most clearly expresses understanding commitment science soldier whose business murder fine art diplomat whose calling based deception secretiveness politician whose very life consists compromises conscience business man whose aim personal profit within limits allowed lenient law—such may excused set patriotic deception above common everyday decency perform services spies
merely accept code morality modern society still conforms
very essence life service truth
know scientists private life come up standard truthfulness nevertheless consciously falsify results their researches
bad enough put up these because reveal lack strength character liable distort results their work
person however uses science cover political spying demeans himself pose before foreign government investigator asks assistance alleged researches order carry under cloak political machinations prostitutes science unpardonable way forfeits right classed scientist
although boas name spies question referring group led sylvanus g
morley affiliated harvard university's peabody museum
while conducting research mexico morley colleagues looked evidence german submarine bases collected intelligence mexican political figures german immigrants mexico
boas's stance against spying took place context struggle establish new model academic anthropology columbia university
previously american anthropology based smithsonian institution washington peabody museum harvard these anthropologists competed boas's students control over american anthropological association flagship publication american anthropologist
national academy sciences established national research council 1916 means scientists assist united states government prepare entry war europe competition two groups intensified
boas's rival w
holmes gotten job director field museum boas passed over years earlier appointed head nrc morley protégé holmes
boas's letter published holmes friend complaining prussian control anthropology country need end boas's hun regime
opinion influenced anti-german probably also anti-jewish sentiment
anthropological society washington passed resolution condemning boas's letter unjustly criticizing president wilson attacking principles american democracy endangering anthropologists abroad now suspected being spies charge especially insulting given concerns very issue prompted boas write letter first place
resolution passed american anthropological association aaa national research council
members american anthropological association among whom boas founding member 1902 meeting peabody museum archaeology ethnology harvard morley lothrop spinden affiliated voted 20 10 censure boas
result boas resigned aaa's representative nrc although remained active member aaa
aaa's censure boas rescinded until 2005
boas continued speak out against racism intellectual freedom
nazi party germany denounced jewish science included boasian anthropology freudian psychoanalysis einsteinian physics boas responded public statement signed over 8000 other scientists declaring there science race religion irrelevant
after world war boas created emergency society german austrian science
organization originally dedicated fostering friendly relations american german austrian scientists providing research funding german scientists adversely affected war help scientists interned
rise nazi germany boas assisted german scientists fleeing nazi regime
boas helped these scientists escape secure positions once arrived
additionally boas addressed open letter paul von hindenburg protest against hitlerism
boas students such melville j
herskovits opposed racist pseudoscience developed kaiser wilhelm institute anthropology human heredity eugenics under director eugen fischer melville j
herskovits franz boas's students pointed out health problems social prejudices encountered these children rhineland bastards their parents explained germans viewed racial inferiority due racial heredity
provoked polemic invective against latter [boas] fischer
views mr
boas part quite ingenious field heredity mr
boas no means competent even though great number research projects kwi-a picked up boas' studies immigrants new york confirmed findings—including study walter dornfeldt eastern european jews berlin
fischer resorted polemic simply because no arguments counter boasians' critique
students influence franz boas died stroke columbia university faculty club december 21 1942 arms claude lévi-strauss
time become most influential respected scientists generation
1901 1911 columbia university produced seven ph ds anthropology
although today's standards very small number time sufficient establish boas's anthropology department columbia preeminent anthropology program country
moreover many boas's students went establish anthropology programs other major universities

boas students also influence claude lévi-strauss interacted boas boasians during stay new york 1940 s
several boas's students went serve editors american anthropological association's flagship journal american anthropologist john r
swanton 1911 1921–1923 robert lowie 1924–1933 leslie spier 1934–1938 melville herskovits 1950–1952
edward sapir's student john alden mason editor 1945 1949 alfred kroeber robert lowie's student walter goldschmidt editor 1956 1959
most boas's students shared concern careful historical reconstruction antipathy towards speculative evolutionary models
moreover boas encouraged students example criticize themselves much others
example boas originally defended cephalic index systematic variations head form method describing hereditary traits came reject earlier research after further study similarly came criticize own early work kwakiutl pacific northwest language mythology
encouraged drive self-criticism well boasian commitment learn one's informants let findings one's research shape one's agenda boas's students quickly diverged own research agenda
several students soon attempted develop theories grand sort boas typically rejected
kroeber called colleagues' attention sigmund freud potential union cultural anthropology psychoanalysis
ruth benedict developed theories culture personality national cultures kroeber's student julian steward developed theories cultural ecology multilineal evolution
legacy nevertheless boas enduring influence anthropology
virtually anthropologists today accept boas's commitment empiricism methodological cultural relativism
moreover virtually cultural anthropologists today share boas's commitment field research involving extended residence learning local language developing social relationships informants
