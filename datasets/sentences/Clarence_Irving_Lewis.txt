career logic lewis studied logic under eventual ph
thesis supervisor josiah royce principal architect modern philosophical logic
1912 two years after publication first volume principia mathematica lewis began publishing articles taking exception principia' s pervasive use material implication specifically bertrand russell's reading a→b implies
lewis restated criticism reviews both editions principia mathematica
lewis's reputation promising young logician soon assured
material implication allows true consequent follow false antecedent
lewis proposed replace material implication strict implication such false antecedent never strictly imply true consequent
strict implication primitive defined terms negation conjunction prefixed unary intensional modal operator
let x formula classical bivalent truth value
then x read x possibly true false case may
lewis then defined strictly implies ab
lewis's strict implication now historical curiosity formal modal logic grounded notion ancestor modern work subject
lewis's notation still standard current practice usually takes dual necessity primitive defined case strictly implies simply written a→b
first logic text survey symbolic logic 1918 went out print after selling several hundred copies
time publication included discussion english logical writings charles peirce second after russell's monograph 1900 leibniz
while modal logic survey soon proved inconsistent lewis went devise modal systems s1 s5 set these out symbolic logic 1932 possible formal analyses alethic modalities
lewis mildly preferred s2 over others amended modal system survey s3 s4 s5 generated sustained interest mathematical well philosophical down present day
s4 s5 beginning now called normal modal logic

pragmatist no positivist section follows dayton 2004 closely
around 1930 american philosophy began experience turning point because arrival logical empiricism brought european philosophers fleeing nazi germany
new doctrine challenged american philosophers naturalistic pragmatic bent such lewis
any event logical empiricism emphasis scientific models knowledge logical analysis meaning soon emerged perhaps dominant tendency american philosophy
while many saw lewis kin logical empiricists never truly comfortable such company because declined divorce experience cognition
positivism rejected value lacking cognitive significance also rejecting analysis experience favor physicalism
both rejections struck regrettable
indeed growing awareness pragmatic tradition led opposite direction
lewis within experience anything significance anything thus came see value way representing significance knowledge future conduct
these convictions led reflect differences pragmatism positivism cognitive structure value experiences
lewis agreed pragmatism committed peircean pragmatic test
1930 essay pragmatism current thought maintained commitment taken either two directions
direction emphasises subjectivity experience
other direction took 'his 1929 began peirce's limitation meaning makes verifiable difference experience
hence concepts abstractions immediate precisely element must left out
claim must properly understood
operational account concepts mainly eliminates ineffable your hours felt twice long mine your pounds twice heavy makes no difference tested our assignment physical properties things
hence concept relational pattern
does follow ought discard world experienced sense connotation concept strictly comprises nothing abstract configuration relations
another sense denotation empirical application meaning vested process characteristically begins something given ends something done operation translates presented datum instrument prediction control
thus knowledge begins ends experience keeping mind beginning ending experiences differ
knowledge something requires verifying experience actually experienced
thus pragmatist verifiability operational definition test empirical meaning statement requires speaker know how apply statement apply able trace consequences statement situations both real hypothetical
lewis firmly objected positivist conception value statements devoid cognitive content merely expressive
pragmatist judgements implicitly value judgements
lewis 1946 sets out both conception sense meaning thesis valuation form empirical cognition
essay logical positivism pragmatism lewis revealed disagreement verificationism comparing unfavorably preferred pragmatic conception empirical meaning
outset saw both pragmatism logical positivism forms empiricism
first glance seem pragmatic conception meaning despite different formulation focus action very much resembles logical positivist verification requirement
nevertheless lewis argued there deep difference two pragmatism ultimately grounds meaning conceivable experience while positivism reduces relation meaning experience matter logical form
lewis positivist conception meaning omits precisely pragmatist count empirical meaning
specifying observation sentences follow given sentence helps us determine empirical meaning given sentence observation sentences themselves already understood meaning terms specific qualities experience predicates observation sentences refer
thus lewis saw logical positivists failing distinguish linguistic meaning namely logical relations among terms empirical meaning namely relation expressions experience
well-known terminology carnap charles w
morris empirical meaning falls under pragmatics linguistic meaning under semantics
lewis logical positivist shuts eyes precisely properly confirms sentence namely content experience
