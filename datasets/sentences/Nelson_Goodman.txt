induction grue book fact fiction forecast goodman introduced new riddle induction so-called analogy hume's classical problem induction
accepted hume's observation inductive reasoning
inferring past experience events future based solely human habit regularities our day-to-day existence accustomed us
goodman argued however hume overlooked fact regularities establish habits given piece copper conducting electricity increases credibility statements asserting other pieces copper conduct electricity while fact given man room third son does increase credibility statements asserting other men room third sons
how then differentiate regularities hypotheses construe law-like statements those contingent based upon accidental generality? hempel's confirmation theory argued solution differentiate hypotheses apply things certain class evidence statements apply thing
goodman's famous counterargument introduce predicate grue applies things examined before certain time t just case green also other things just case blue examined before time t
examine emeralds before time t find emerald green emerald green forth each will confirm hypothesis emeralds green
however emeralds c
also confirm hypothesis emeralds grue
thus before time t apparently law-like statements emeralds green emeralds grue equally well confirmed observation obviously emeralds grue law-like statement
goodman's example showed difficulty determining constitutes law-like statements far greater previously thought once again find ourselves facing initial dilemma anything confirm anything
nominalism mereology goodman along stanislaw lesniewski founder contemporary variant nominalism argues philosophy logic mathematics should dispense set theory
goodman's nominalism driven purely ontological considerations
after long difficult 1947 paper coauthored w
quine goodman ceased trouble himself finding way reconstruct mathematics while dispensing set theory discredited sole foundations mathematics 1913 russell/whitehead
program david hilbert reconstruct logical axioms proven futile 1936 gödel
because other failures seemingly fruitful lines research quine soon came believe such reconstruction impossible goodman's penn colleague richard milton martin argued otherwise writing number papers suggesting ways forward
according thomas tymoczko's afterword new directions philosophy mathematics quine urged abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics science just accept resulting assimilation putting key burden theories networks sentences accept individual sentences whose significance change dramatically depending their theoretical context
doing tymoczko claimed philosophy mathematics philosophy science merged quasi-empiricism emphasis mathematical practice effectively part scientific method emphasis method over result
goodman–leonard 1940 calculus individuals starting point american variant mereology
while exposition goodman leonard invoked bit naive set theory variant calculus individuals grounds goodman's 1951 structure appearance revision extension ph
thesis makes no mention notion set while ph

simons 1987 casati varzi 1999 show calculus individuals grounded either bit set theory monadic predicates schematically employed
mereology accordingly ontologically neutral retains quine's pragmatism tymoczko 1998 carefully qualified american pragmatism
