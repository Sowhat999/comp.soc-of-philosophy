andrews scotland published grain universe text hauerwas argued karl barth foremost natural theologian gifford lectures
such argument controversial since karl barth well known enemy natural theology
hauerwas however barth argued christian convictions world describe god's good creation while emphasizing such convictions cannot understood apart christian witness
according hauerwas makes barth proper natural theologian comparison reinhold niebuhr william james also featured lectures
earlier 1997 gave scottish journal theology lectures aberdeen published sanctify them truth 1998
basic theological philosophical views hauerwas long associated narrative theology postliberal theology closely related necessarily synonymous movements
both these movements attached yale biblical scholars brevard childs hans frei george lindbeck
hauerwas received theological training yale university during 1960 s
hauerwas writes narrative necessary grammar christian convictions christian claims inextricably linked god done history ongoing story god's people move through time
sense hypertemporal god hauerwas claims gotten john howard yoder impressed upon need locating god's actions timeliness created order witnessed bible
explained understanding people
church constituted their ongoing story god terms pointed oft-repeated aphorism my claim offensive first task church make world world make world just correlative theological metaphysics
world simply cannot narrated - world cannot story - unless people exist make world world
eschatological claim presupposes know there beginning because seen end
[c]reation names god's continuing action god's unrelenting desire us want loved love manifest christ's life death resurrection

among hauerwas's most well-known critics jeffrey stout princeton nicholas wolterstorff yale though both often praised work well
interaction thought niebuhrs hauerwas's theological views may best illuminated engagement work reinhold niebuhr h
richard niebuhr often considered two most influential american theologians 20 th century
hauerwas frequently discusses work both niebuhr brothers mentioning them form most books
reinhold also primary subjects hauerwas' 2000–2001 gifford lectures later republished book form under title grain universe
early years career hauerwas deeply influenced work both brothers
however later primarily result encountering work john howard yoder came disagree fundamental elements their theology while continuing affirm other elements their work finds important
while many believe niebuhrs' advocacy christian realism represents rejection liberal christianity hauerwas argues brothers actually belong theological tradition
while both placed strong emphasis sinfulness humanity stood stark contrast most liberal thinkers believes niebuhrs based their theologies presuppositions secular philosophy rather those christianity thus placing them liberal tradition modern christian thought
particular hauerwas argues reinhold niebuhr deeply influenced william james accepting pragmatist epistemology
should noted reinhold niebuhr's supporters perhaps most notably gabriel fackre argue hauerwas wrong point during niebuhr's career theology evolved being strongly neo-orthodox rather liberal
hauerwas niebuhrs important figures part because flaws their thinking represent same flaws endemic much modern christianity church often being shaped culture liberal democracy message jesus
hauerwas' view led church christians general compromise their values place too much faith secular political ideologies often leading misplaced passion political power
represents thesis hauerwas most popular book resident aliens co-written william willimon
book hauerwas willimon argue church's accommodation secular culture led tragedies like dropping atomic bomb hiroshima hauerwas therefore believes niebuhrs' thinking subject same flaws jerry falwell hauerwas willimon stating few books greater hindrance accurate assessment [the church's] situation h
richard niebuhr's famous book christ culture
thus according hauerwas while may disagreed comes policy both niebuhrs falwell fell prey notion christians duty use political process means enact christian legislation pursue justice
book peaceable kingdom hauerwas offers commentary two classic essays written niebuhrs christian century subject conflict manchuria
first essay entitled grace doing nothing h
richard niebuhr argues humans self-interested egoistic christians because subject these same flaws should remain non-violent even time war
essay response entitled must nothing? reinhold niebuhr argues christians must self-awareness their own sinfulness self-interestedness must sometimes use force protect certain ideals people
commentary hauerwas acknowledges both brothers make important points critiques reinhold's view ultimately agreeing h
richard niebuhr
views human experimentation deontological utilitarian thought basic utilitarian rationalization research human beings ends justify means
means any sort research human being justified possibility successfully saving others
example cancer research justified possibility finding cure cancer inevitably save life many others
utilitarian argument focuses greatest good greatest amount people greater good
under utilitarian justification person's duty sacrifice himself herself save others long individual person's societal worth less combined societal worth others
therefore either doctor homeless person must die save lives many others homeless person must sacrifice himself since worth less society doctor
deontological argument against research human beings persons ends themselves
means cannot use people any purpose
deontological argument relies belief should treat others like treated
someone suffering terminal illness likely die shortly under deontological assumptions research done them even meant saving lives millions
understanding experimentation hauerwas finds these two moral theories very limiting because quandary ethics cases rely extreme situations
believes there needs third reasoning falls somewhere these two
believes basic doctor-patient relationship should built trust caring
characterizes deontological thinker however does believe research human beings
hauerwas’s perspective there needs middle ground these two perspectives
patient becomes dehumanized through research however without research there little medical improvement
hauerwas therefore believes middle ground should focus caring patient instead curing
hauerwas believes moral understanding handle current medicine
mentioned above hauerwas believes moral issue experimentation humans cannot answered utilitarianism versus deontological perspective
believes society lacks cohesive understanding notions “the good mankind” “the rights individual
issue solved society come conclusive decision how science should used serve humans needs
therapeutic nontherapeutic experimentation humans differentiated intent procedure
therapeutic experimentation meant help patient their current needs while nontherapeutic experimentation no intention helping patient collect research benefit future patients
issue becomes should medical progress helping current patient future patient? stanley hauerwas believes society no consensus meanings health illness contributes issue how patients should treated
society comes universal understanding these issues moral dilemma experimentation humans resolved
informed consent hauerwas finds little justification human experimentation through informed consent
argues patient’s understanding experimental procedure will never approach her physician
questions even possibility patient reaching state “informed consent
further believes individuals reach such state “informed consent” does mean individuals should consent fully understand meaning their consent
“for persons misuse themselves even voluntarily full knowledge
individuals consenting experimentation through justification human good turn themselves objects use experimentation
issue further complicated hauerwas whom should considered medical experimentation
use prisoners proliferates social stereotypes denigration
believes informed consent necessary human experimentation does provide justification our willingness submit participate experimentation
language rights hauerwas finds language “rights” disturbing assumes people relate others strangers lends even understanding family contractual society
argues being part family however voluntary undertaking
such part family kinds responsibilities each member holds relation each other
hauerwas finds parent you duty your children just because you brought them existence because role parent ensure children brought up way conducive community’s values
thus issue “rights” language attempts prevent maltreatment individuals point exclusion familial communal responsibility
hauerwas’s bottom line there no real society members relate terms noninterference
language rights destroys society because regard people strangers instead assuming responsibility towards them family members community share
views death dying well hauerwas believes there difference concept death criteria death
concept death “involves philosophical judgment significant change happened person” therefore “is correlative takes necessary condition human life e
… potential consciousness”
criteria death however “those empirical measurements made determine whether person dead such cessation respiration flat eeg”
thus brain death criterion death may serve “as symbol time die”
person must delay death long no longer possible die good death
subject suicide hauerwas challenges claim autonomous suicide morally acceptable also wants distinguish himself position denies rational suicide
believes suicide often rational decision “autonomous” agent does agree notion justified
contends suicide institution must considered morally doubtful life given should considered gift bestowed upon us god
many term rational suicide based assumption decision live die depends whether life meaning purpose
[citation needed] hauerwas however contends reason should live because our lives ours such reminds us there commitment keep living
yet while there may times our lives suicide may seem rational mere existence allows us enjoy certain joys such helping another healing sick should enough sustain our commitment living
according hauerwas “good death death prepare through living because able see death necessary correlative good life
long life may give person chance good death because may able get himself morally line during time period also possible die well quickly you lived morally
good death also requires death morally proportion way lived sustained occurs way allows those caring us see sustaining us
views patience courage set up hauerwas’s stance courage must understanding philosophy patience
according essay “practicing patience how christians should sick” christians among virtues christians called patient patients sickness health because “patience integral christian life
patience can’t first learned while being patient
learn patience christians exercise virtue through deeds truth practice living
hauerwas also pointed out patience virtue common god
“in patience beginning source takes splendor dignity
author went say god showed us best example patience came life jesus
because god foundation hauerwas stated “only patience shaped christ true patience
top later emphasized patience isn’t developed human will given through holy spirit gives us capacity love “without [love] us there cannot patience because good men [love] god endures things
author’s essay gave people framework how learn practice patience sick
given another learn live another
we’ve given time space develop habits activities require patience
now patience explained courage better understood
stanley hauerwas spoke courage essay “courage exemplified” christians among virtues
first looked aristotle firmly believed soldiers show courage
also courage acquired through imitation action emotion virtue required practice before mastered
hauerwas indicated aristotle “without war courage fully known
philosopher also spoke aquinas’ view courage
begin expressed aquinas charity central trunk other virtues branch out includes courage
contrast aristotle courage isn’t just battlefield adds any situation might face danger death such tending sick bed loved going walk unknown friend
according essay aquinas “treats fortitude such way ends transformed charity
even though situation might dangerous individual courageous because possess love person helping
courage then accessible opposed aristotle’s view
transition hauerwas added christian mix narrated christianity requires courage “a kind endurance face difficulty danger oppression
tie first essay went say patience perseverance “integral very meaning virtue
say christian must patience get through tough times
ultimate display courage through martyr “required patiently persevere since confidence enduring wrong gift charity
philosopher also highlighted true courage gift holy spirit “courage gift spirit protects martyr ‘dread danger
’ martyr best example because believe “god will complete god’s work [them] even [their] lives taken [the] enemies
eyes both aquinas hauerwas “those formed courage necessary face death well will easily led fuller amount courage offered christians
overall hauerwas believes america courageous because don't act out charity
church rest america? answer no
“we america lost our moral vision precisely lost our courage fight right good
