metaphysics religion landauer's ideas metaphysics religion changed around 1900
essay christentum und anarchismus christianity anarchism published 1895 magazine sozialist landauer posed against religion
especially rejected monotheist religions such christianity judaism islam saying denied any revelation
also seen 1895 text series articles zur entwicklungsgeschichte des individuums developmental history individual landauer pronounced himself favour buddha
unlike religions mentioned before buddha supported statements arguments
under mystic-symbolic cloak teachings reincarnation believes discovered deep-lying core truth now express truth without cloak
until 1903 landauer clearly rejected religious concepts such god immortality hereafter revelation etc
instead believed rationality enlightenment
essay skepsis und mystik scepticism mysticism published 1903 there turn landauer's thinking towards mysticism
translation doctrines meister eckhart die mystischen schriften des meister eckhart middle high german high german also published 1903
although landauer still skeptical meister eckhart's concept god because instead talking god actually talks worldly world spirit
divine-oneness meister eckhart seen perspective essence bliss nature essential things transcendent
thus argued landauer pantheism mind
also often wrongly called meister eckhart pantheist
eckhart term pan-en-theism things god probably fitting
landauer's view religion during conception mysticism characterized follows still regards concrete manifestations ecclesiastical christianity negative among them priests professors philosophy also priests founders philosophies quickly find peace something positive
sympathizes those passionately desire peace cannot appeased anything such heretics sectarians mystics
amongst others skepsis und mystik scepticism mysticism landauer mentions dionysius areopagita johannes scotus eriugena meister eckhart giovanni pico della mirandola jakob böhme angelus silesius alfred mombert
their common trait accept terms concepts intellectually correct therefore opposed religious groups
these thinkers world senses something metaphorical
segregation try unite their self world
landauer's reverence mysticism enabled include christ thinking
interprets christ symbol man becoming god
landauer becoming god means merger self world that's exactly christ showed us
age landauer broke jewish religious community
described before rather referred christian-mystical tradition judaism
around 1907 consciously returned judaism religious traditions
important impetus reversal came martin buber whom good friends
buber also occupied himself beginning century christian mysticism
then landauer also included hasidic mysticism thinking
interesting how landauer coins terms time eternity essay skepsis und mystik sceticism mysticism
eckhart neoplatonists christian pre-christian tradition plotinus augustinus dionysius areopagita scotus eriugena bonaventura etc
respectively define eternity time span forever expanded
eternity rather present every moment time contains time whole transcends same time
secluded person free himself time experiences eternity mystical show spiritual perception plotinus
landauer eternity same time everlasting temporal continuation also source temporal stream development entwicklungsstrom
idea past future distortion space because applying ideas space suggested standing point see past future
opinions eternity everlasting temporal continuation source time seem contradict each other
landauer eternity remains bound course time
declares eternal renewal constant through temporal quality differences quite possibly appear eternal presence
landauer's perception time eternity distinguishes itself regarding past present future category time result distortion space
thus eternity temporal course same time source time
neoplatonists meister eckhart also talk temporal course time embraced eternity same time source time
thus eternity experienced mystical show spiritual perception plotinus within time
meister eckhart well landauer key experience lies so-called secludedness
mystical anthropology mystical anthropology man within divine spark uncreated base soul goes make up actual human nature same time god
bible says man image god
define actual nature man landauer explicitly refers meister eckhart
therefore according landauer our individual firmly standing itself deeply retreating itself same time our most general connects us whole all-one world leads us unity
landauer says skepsis und mystik see skepsis und mystik 1978 p
17 deeper return home myself am blessed world
landauer sinking one's self means being blessed world
neoplatonism according meister eckhart search one's own heart end leads recognition vision god
another difference mystical anthropology landauer eckhart concept heredity landauer propagates
individual result long chain ancestors still present executing power over person
upright carriage man e
visible sign power first humans over us
heredity leads us back beyond human animal ancestors way inorganic world
thought confirmed skepsis und mystik mystical idea man whole world himself
thus our complete ancestry within us
landauer also connects concepts mankind human nature addition defines divine
course world emphasized comparison human individual
turn human individual subordinate human race
individualization result will world will individual human race
1895 landauer still adhered thesis individuals result will human race
around time also declared someone stepped out mass own independent self larger influence mankind
other hand skepsis und mystik scepticism mysticism world separate off individuals flare up appear within them world wants become
until 1900 landauer started out individual fulfill himself order come up primordial idea progressing mankind
after 1900 human being any time coincide world say man fulfill himself any time
utopia thus moved future eternal presence mystically experienced
thus future course socialism anarchism does depend certain development stage mankind
landauer seclusion necessary order break through human race
skepsis und mystik scepticism mysticism writes firmer individual footed himself deeper retreats himself isolates himself influences surroundings finds himself coinciding world past originally
originally landauer means human community stronger noble much older frail influence state society
seclusion consequences individuals themselves
seclusion individuals also returned unity world
political philosophy ethical anarchism above described philosophical sources works landauer developed anarchism individualistic rejected individualist anarchism
landauer supported anarchism already 1890 s
those years especially enthusiastic individualistic approach max stirner
didn't want stay behind stirner's extremely individual approach wanted develop new general public unity community
social anarchism union individuals voluntary basis small socialist communities came together freely
landauer's goal emancipation state church other forms subordination society
expression 'anarchism' stems greek arche meaning 'power' 'reign' 'rule'
thus 'an-archy' equals 'non-power' 'no-reign' 'no-rule'
rejection state common anarchist positions
also reject institutions moral concepts such church matrimony family rejection course voluntary
landauer came out against marxists social democrats reproaching them wanting erect another state executing power
anarchism spiritual movement almost religious
contrast other anarchists reject matrimony contrary pillar community landauer's system
true anarchism results inner segregation individuals
here once list most important aspects landauer's anarchism anarchism entails absence power reign hierarchy forced institutions anarchism equatable terrorism achieved through non-violence
anarchism cannot based upon egoistic individualism
exactly freed
precondition autonomy independence respectively seclusion leads unity world
according landauer necessary change nature man least change ways finally inner convictions appear lived
includes anarchism deed never strictly theoretical

cause begging dependent position those without possessions
landowner deny landless
latter needs land purpose direct indirect consumption thus creating dependency
land ownership correlate landlessness according landauer roots slavery bondage tribute lease interest proletariat
solution problem simply lies dissolution land ownership
aufruf zum sozialismus call socialism landauer elucidated abolition property will mainly also change spirit rebirth will stem powerful redistribution property will redistribute land different intervals future over over again
justice will depend inner spiritual attitude people
there will no need legal procedures pertaining just distribution land because spirit people will voluntarily recognise just distribution
2 second evil stressed landauer superiority money means exchange goods
after time goods lose their value through use
money makes disastrous exception part exchange devaluation
there just exchange economy money used cannot quality our money absolute value
landauer also regards interest damaging because creates constant economical growth
main evil present money non-consumptiveness
landauer's idea free exchange economy money must become equal compared goods having dual character exchange consumption
basically refers ideas economist silvio gesell
aufruf zum sozialismus writes therefore proposals silvio gesell find kind money unlike today does gain value contrary progressively loses value time
thus vendor product now possessing money will pressed exchange another product soon possible etc
according landauer gesell very few learned pierre joseph proudhon
producing acquiring means exchange there will no other interest consumption
proudhon's idea fast circulation money brings happiness liveliness one's private life while dropping off market stubbornness persisting money also brings life grind
[citation needed] gesell proposed reformation monetary system instead money used until now called free money introduced
money given out form notes along little tickets torn off smaller change
little tickets also serve devaluation because every week must diminished 1/1000 value
every week owner note must attach stamp indicate devaluation 1/1000
induces owner money spend soon possible
coins abolished central bank replaced currency office responsible transactions contributions regulation circulation
office also withdraw notes end year replace them new ones
landauer fully supported idea gesell
3 third evil leading slavery according landauer added value
value initially means claim against someone meaning economical ethical value
word value includes expectation price should equal material value
respective price usually much higher sum wages paid make product
because people want make use every advantage property also rarity commodity demand ignorance consumer
result work cannot buy everything paid produce considerable part remains buying power profit
aufruf zum sozialismus landauer criticizes marxism follows pointing out one-sided emphasis question wages workers unions connected wrong perception added value marxists
earlier times saw how wages prices mutually dependent now point out opinion totally false according so-called added value absolute quantity produced undertaker flows other capitalist categories
truth landauer every each profit drawn labour
there no productivity property no productivity capital such productivity labour
