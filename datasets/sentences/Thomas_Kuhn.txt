vleck gaston bachelard · jean piaget bertrand russell · karl popper influenced paul feyerabend imre lakatos philip kitcher thomas samuel kuhn /ˈkuːn/ july 18 1922 june 17 1996 american physicist historian philosopher science whose controversial 1962 book structure scientific revolutions influential both academic popular circles introducing term paradigm shift since become english-language idiom
kuhn made several notable claims concerning progress scientific knowledge scientific fields undergo periodic paradigm shifts rather solely progressing linear continuous way these paradigm shifts open up new approaches understanding scientists never considered valid before notion scientific truth any given moment cannot established solely objective criteria defined consensus scientific community
competing paradigms frequently incommensurable competing irreconcilable accounts reality
thus our comprehension science never rely wholly upon objectivity alone
science must account subjective perspectives well since objective conclusions ultimately founded upon subjective conditioning/worldview researchers participants

structure scientific revolutions main article structure scientific revolutions structure scientific revolutions ssr originally printed article international encyclopedia unified science published logical positivists vienna circle
book kuhn argued science does progress via linear accumulation new knowledge undergoes periodic revolutions also called paradigm shifts although coin phrase nature scientific inquiry within particular field abruptly transformed
general science broken up three distinct stages
prescience lacks central paradigm comes first
followed normal science scientists attempt enlarge central paradigm puzzle-solving
guided paradigm normal science extremely productive paradigm successful profession will solved problems members scarcely imagined never undertaken without commitment paradigm
during period normal science failure result conform paradigm seen refuting paradigm mistake researcher contra popper's falsifiability criterion
anomalous results build up science reaches crisis point new paradigm subsumes old results along anomalous results framework accepted
termed revolutionary science
ssr kuhn also argues rival paradigms incommensurable—that possible understand paradigm through conceptual framework terminology another rival paradigm
many critics example david stove popper after 1982 thesis seemed entail theory choice fundamentally irrational rival theories cannot directly compared then cannot make rational choice better
whether kuhn's views such relativistic consequences subject much debate kuhn himself denied accusation relativism third edition ssr sought clarify views avoid further misinterpretation
freeman dyson quoted kuhn saying am kuhnian! referring relativism philosophers developed based work
enormous impact kuhn's work measured changes brought vocabulary philosophy science besides paradigm shift kuhn popularized word paradigm itself term used certain forms linguistics work georg lichtenberg current broader meaning coined term normal science refer relatively routine day-to-day work scientists working within paradigm largely responsible use term scientific revolutions plural taking place widely different periods time different disciplines opposed single scientific revolution late renaissance
frequent use phrase paradigm shift made scientists aware many cases receptive paradigm changes kuhn's analysis evolution scientific views itself influenced evolution
[citation needed] kuhn's work extensively used social science instance post-positivist/positivist debate within international relations
kuhn credited foundational force behind post-mertonian sociology scientific knowledge
kuhn's work also used arts humanities such matthew edward harris distinguish scientific historical communities such political religious groups 'political-religious beliefs opinions epistemologically same those pertaining scientific theories'
because would-be scientists' worldviews changed through rigorous training through engagement kuhn calls 'exemplars' global paradigm
kuhn's notions paradigms paradigm shifts influential understanding history economic thought example keynesian revolution debates political science
defense kuhn gives against objection account science structure scientific revolutions results relativism found essay kuhn called objectivity value judgment theory choice
essay reiterates five criteria penultimate chapter ssr determine help determine properly theory choice - accurate - empirically adequate experimentation observation - consistent - internally consistent also externally consistent other theories - broad scope - theory's consequences should extend beyond initially designed explain - simple - simplest explanation principally similar occam's razor - fruitful - theory should disclose new phenomena new relationships among phenomena then goes show how although these criteria admittedly determine theory choice imprecise practice relative individual scientists
according kuhn scientists must choose competing theories two men fully committed same list criteria choice may nevertheless reach different conclusions
reason criteria still objective usual sense word because individual scientists reach different conclusions same criteria due valuing criterion over another even adding additional criteria selfish other subjective reasons
kuhn then goes say am suggesting course criteria choice began function rules determine choice values influence
because kuhn utilizes history science account science criteria values theory choice often understood descriptive normative rules properly values theory choice scientific community rather prescriptive normative rules usual sense word criteria although there many varied interpretations kuhn's account science
polanyi–kuhn debate although used different terminologies both kuhn michael polanyi believed scientists' subjective experiences made science relativized discipline
polanyi lectured topic decades before kuhn published structure scientific revolutions
supporters polanyi charged kuhn plagiarism known kuhn attended several polanyi's lectures two men debated endlessly over epistemology before either achieved fame
charge plagiarism peculiar kuhn generously acknowledged polanyi first edition structure scientific revolutions
despite intellectual alliance polanyi's work constantly interpreted others within framework kuhn's paradigm shifts much polanyi's kuhn's dismay
