paternal great-grandfather grandfather both theology professors göttingen father law professor kiel munich
max planck's signature ten years age planck born kiel holstein johann julius wilhelm planck second wife emma patzig
baptised name karl ernst ludwig marx planck given names marx now obsolete variant markus maybe simply error max actually short maximilian indicated primary name
however age ten signed name max used rest life
6 th child family though two siblings father's first marriage
among earliest memories marching prussian austrian troops kiel during second schleswig war 1864
1867 family moved munich planck enrolled maximilians gymnasium school came under tutelage hermann müller mathematician took interest youth taught astronomy mechanics well mathematics
müller planck first learned principle conservation energy
planck graduated early age 17
how planck first came contact field physics
planck gifted came music
took singing lessons played piano organ cello composed songs operas
however instead music chose study physics
planck young man 1878 munich physics professor philipp von jolly advised planck against going physics saying field almost everything already discovered remains fill few holes
planck replied wish discover new things understand known fundamentals field began studies 1874 university munich
under jolly's supervision planck performed experiments scientific career studying diffusion hydrogen through heated platinum transferred theoretical physics
1877 went friedrich wilhelms university berlin year study physicists hermann von helmholtz gustav kirchhoff mathematician karl weierstrass
helmholtz never quite prepared spoke slowly miscalculated endlessly bored listeners while kirchhoff spoke carefully prepared lectures dry monotonous
soon became close friends helmholtz
while there undertook program mostly self-study clausius's writings led choose heat theory field
october 1878 planck passed qualifying exams february 1879 defended dissertation über den zweiten hauptsatz mechanischen wärmetheorie second law thermodynamics
briefly taught mathematics physics former school munich
june 1880 presented habilitation thesis gleichgewichtszustände isotroper körper verschiedenen temperaturen equilibrium states isotropic bodies different temperatures
academic career completion habilitation thesis planck became unpaid private lecturer privatdozent munich waiting until offered academic position
although initially ignored academic community furthered work field heat theory discovered after another same thermodynamical formalism gibbs without realizing
clausius's ideas entropy occupied central role work
april 1885 university kiel appointed planck associate professor theoretical physics
further work entropy treatment especially applied physical chemistry followed
published treatise thermodynamics 1897
proposed thermodynamic basis svante arrhenius's theory electrolytic dissociation
within four years named successor kirchhoff's position friedrich-wilhelms-universität berlin presumably thanks helmholtz's intercession 1892 became full professor
1907 planck offered boltzmann's position vienna turned down stay berlin
during 1909 university berlin professor invited become ernest kempton adams lecturer theoretical physics columbia university new york city
series lectures translated co-published columbia university professor
retired berlin 10 january 1926 succeeded erwin schrödinger
family march 1887 planck married marie merck 1861–1909 sister school fellow moved her sublet apartment kiel
four children karl 1888–1916 twins emma 1889–1919 grete 1889–1917 erwin 1893–1945
after apartment berlin planck family lived villa berlin-grunewald wangenheimstrasse 21
several other professors berlin university lived nearby among them theologian adolf von harnack became close friend planck
soon planck home became social cultural centre
numerous well-known scientists such albert einstein otto hahn lise meitner frequent visitors
tradition jointly performing music already established home helmholtz
after several happy years july 1909 marie planck died possibly tuberculosis
march 1911 planck married second wife marga von hoesslin 1882–1948 december fifth child hermann born
during first world war planck's second son erwin taken prisoner french 1914 while oldest son karl killed action verdun
grete died 1917 while giving birth her first child
her sister died same way two years later after having married grete's widower
both granddaughters survived named after their mothers
planck endured these losses stoically
january 1945 erwin whom particularly close sentenced death nazi volksgerichtshof because participation failed attempt assassinate hitler july 1944
erwin executed 23 january 1945
professor berlin university professor friedrich-wilhelms-universität berlin planck joined local physical society
later time those days essentially theoretical physicist there whence things easy me because started mentioning entropy quite fashionable since regarded mathematical spook
thanks initiative various local physical societies germany merged 1898 form german physical society deutsche physikalische gesellschaft dpg 1905 1909 planck president
plaque humboldt university berlin max planck discoverer elementary quantum action h taught building 1889 1928
planck started six-semester course lectures theoretical physics dry somewhat impersonal according lise meitner using no notes never making mistakes never faltering best lecturer ever heard according english participant james r
partington continues there many standing around room
lecture-room well heated rather close listeners time time drop floor disturb lecture
planck establish actual school number graduate students 20 among them 1897 max abraham 1875–1922 1904 moritz schlick 1882–1936 1906 walther meissner 1882–1974 1906 max von laue 1879–1960 1907 fritz reiche 1883–1960 1912 walter schottky 1886–1976 1914 walther bothe 1891–1957 black-body radiation 1894 planck turned attention problem black-body radiation
commissioned electric companies create maximum light lightbulbs minimum energy
problem stated kirchhoff 1859 how does intensity electromagnetic radiation emitted black body perfect absorber also known cavity radiator depend frequency radiation
color light temperature body?
question explored experimentally no theoretical treatment agreed experimental values
wilhelm wien proposed wien's law correctly predicted behaviour high frequencies failed low frequencies
rayleigh–jeans law another approach problem created later known ultraviolet catastrophe contrary many textbooks motivation planck
planck's first proposed solution problem 1899 followed planck called principle elementary disorder allowed derive wien's law number assumptions entropy ideal oscillator creating referred-to wien–planck law
soon found experimental evidence confirm new law planck's frustration
planck revised approach deriving first version famous planck black-body radiation law described experimentally observed black-body spectrum well
first proposed meeting dpg 19 october 1900 published 1901
first derivation include energy quantisation use statistical mechanics held aversion
november 1900 planck revised first approach relying boltzmann's statistical interpretation second law thermodynamics way gaining fundamental understanding principles behind radiation law
planck deeply suspicious philosophical physical implications such interpretation boltzmann's approach recourse them later put act despair
ready sacrifice any my previous convictions physics
central assumption behind new derivation presented dpg 14 december 1900 supposition now known planck postulate electromagnetic energy emitted quantized form other words energy multiple elementary unit planck's constant also known planck's action quantum introduced already 1899 greek letter nu roman letter v frequency radiation
note elementary units energy discussed here represented simply
physicists now call these quanta photons photon frequency will own specific unique energy
total energy frequency then equal multiplied number photons frequency
planck 1918 year received nobel prize physics work quantum theory first planck considered quantisation purely formal assumption
actually think much
nowadays assumption incompatible classical physics regarded birth quantum physics greatest intellectual accomplishment planck's career ludwig boltzmann discussing theoretical paper 1877 possibility energy states physical system discrete
discovery planck's constant enabled define new universal set physical units such planck length planck mass based fundamental physical constants upon much quantum theory based
recognition planck's fundamental contribution new branch physics awarded nobel prize physics 1918
subsequently planck tried grasp meaning energy quanta no avail
my unavailing attempts somehow reintegrate action quantum classical theory extended over several years caused me much trouble
even several years later other physicists like rayleigh jeans lorentz set planck's constant zero order align classical physics planck knew well constant precise nonzero value
am unable understand jeans' stubbornness example theoretician should never existing same hegel philosophy
much worse facts don't fit
max born planck nature conservative mind nothing revolutionary thoroughly skeptical speculations
yet belief compelling force logical reasoning facts strong flinch announcing most revolutionary idea ever shaken physics
einstein theory relativity 1905 three epochal papers hitherto completely unknown albert einstein published journal annalen physik
planck among few immediately recognized significance special theory relativity
thanks influence theory soon widely accepted germany
planck also contributed considerably extend special theory relativity
example recast theory terms classical action
einstein's hypothesis light quanta photons based philipp lenard's 1902 discovery photoelectric effect initially rejected planck
unwilling discard completely maxwell's theory electrodynamics
theory light thrown back decades centuries age christian huygens dared fight against mighty emission theory isaac newton
[citation needed] 1910 einstein pointed out anomalous behavior specific heat low temperatures another example phenomenon defies explanation classical physics
planck nernst seeking clarify increasing number contradictions organized first solvay conference brussels 1911
meeting einstein able convince planck
meanwhile planck appointed dean berlin university whereby possible call einstein berlin establish new professorship 1914
soon two scientists became close friends met frequently play music together
world war onset first world war planck endorsed general excitement public writing besides much horrible there also much unexpectedly great beautiful smooth solution most difficult domestic political problems unification parties
extolling everything good noble
nonetheless planck refrained extremes nationalism
1915 time italy join allied powers voted successfully scientific paper italy received prize prussian academy sciences planck four permanent presidents
planck also signed infamous manifesto 93 intellectuals pamphlet polemic war propaganda while einstein retained strictly pacifistic attitude almost led imprisonment being spared swiss citizenship
1915 planck after several meetings dutch physicist lorentz revoked parts manifesto
then 1916 signed declaration against german annexationism
post war weimar republic turbulent post-war years planck now highest authority german physics issued slogan persevere continue working colleagues
october 1920 fritz haber established notgemeinschaft deutschen wissenschaft emergency organization german science aimed providing financial support scientific research
considerable portion money organization distribute raised abroad
planck also held leading positions berlin university prussian academy sciences german physical society kaiser wilhelm society 1948 became max planck society
during time economic conditions germany such hardly able conduct research
1926 planck became foreign member royal netherlands academy arts sciences
during interwar period planck became member deutsche volks-partei german people's party party nobel peace prize laureate gustav stresemann aspired liberal aims domestic policy rather revisionistic aims politics around world
planck disagreed introduction universal suffrage later expressed view nazi dictatorship resulted ascent rule crowds
quantum mechanics left right w
einstein m
planck r
millikan von laue dinner given von laue berlin november 1931 end 1920 s bohr heisenberg pauli worked out copenhagen interpretation quantum mechanics rejected planck schrödinger laue einstein well
planck expected wave mechanics soon render quantum theory—his own child—unnecessary
case however
further work cemented quantum theory even against einstein's philosophical revulsions
planck experienced truth own earlier observation struggle older views younger years new scientific truth does triumph convincing opponents making them see light rather because opponents eventually die new generation grows up familiar
nazi dictatorship world war ii nazis seized power 1933 planck 74
witnessed many jewish friends colleagues expelled their positions humiliated hundreds scientists emigrated nazi germany
again tried persevere continue working asked scientists considering emigration remain germany
hoped crisis abate soon political situation improve
otto hahn asked planck gather well-known german professors order issue public proclamation against treatment jewish professors planck replied you able gather today 30 such gentlemen then tomorrow 150 others will come speak against because eager take over positions others
under planck's leadership kaiser wilhelm society kwg avoided open conflict nazi regime except concerning fritz haber
planck tried discuss issue adolf hitler unsuccessful
following year 1934 haber died exile
year later planck having president kwg since 1930 organized somewhat provocative style official commemorative meeting haber
also succeeded secretly enabling number jewish scientists continue working institutes kwg several years
1936 term president kwg ended nazi government pressured refrain seeking another term
political climate germany gradually became hostile johannes stark prominent exponent deutsche physik german physics also called aryan physics attacked planck sommerfeld heisenberg continuing teach theories einstein calling them white jews
hauptamt wissenschaft nazi government office science started investigation planck's ancestry claiming 1/16 jewish however planck himself denied
max planck's grave göttingen 1938 planck celebrated 80 th birthday
dpg held celebration during max-planck medal founded highest medal dpg 1928 awarded french physicist louis de broglie
end 1938 prussian academy lost remaining independence taken over nazis gleichschaltung
planck protested resigning presidency
continued travel frequently giving numerous public talks such talk religion science five years later sufficiently fit climb 3000-meter peaks alps
during second world war increasing number allied bombing missions against berlin forced planck wife temporarily leave city live countryside
1942 me ardent desire grown persevere crisis live long enough able witness turning point beginning new rise
february 1944 home berlin completely destroyed air raid annihilating scientific records correspondence
rural retreat threatened rapid advance allied armies both sides
after end war planck second wife son her brought relative göttingen planck died 4 october 1947
grave situated old stadtfriedhof city cemetery göttingen
1945 planck's younger son erwin arrested due attempted assassination hitler july 20 plot
erwin consequently died hands gestapo death destroyed much max planck's will live
religious views planck member lutheran church germany
however planck very tolerant towards alternative views religions
lecture 1937 entitled religion und naturwissenschaft suggested importance these symbols rituals related directly believer's ability worship god must mindful symbols provide imperfect illustration divinity
criticized atheism being focused derision such symbols while same time warned over-estimation importance such symbols believers
max planck 1944 man devoted whole life most clear headed science study matter tell you result my research atoms much there no matter such
matter originates exists virtue force brings particle atom vibration holds most minute solar system atom together
must assume behind force existence conscious intelligent mind
mind matrix matter
planck regarded scientist man imagination faith faith interpreted being similar having working hypothesis
example causality principle isn't true false act faith
thereby planck may indicated view points toward imre lakatos' research programs process descriptions falsification mostly tolerable faith future removal
also both religion science require belief god
believers god beginning physicists end considerations… former foundation latter crown edifice every generalized world view
other hand planck
'to believe' means 'to recognize truth' knowledge nature continually advancing incontestably safe tracks made utterly impossible person possessing training natural science recognize founded truth many reports extraordinary occurrences contradicting laws nature miracles still commonly regarded essential supports confirmations religious doctrines formerly used accepted facts pure simple without doubt criticism
belief miracles must retreat step step before relentlessly reliably progressing science cannot doubt sooner later must vanish completely
later life planck's views god deist
example six months before death rumour started planck converted catholicism questioned brought make step declared although deeply religious believe personal god let alone christian god
