essay analytical approach definition political concepts re-introduced methods analytic philosophy study political philosophy
spurred background philosophy language berlin argued nuanced subtle understanding our political terminology superficially understood single concept mask plurality different uses therefore meanings
berlin argued these multiple differing concepts otherwise masked rhetorical conflations showed plurality incompatibility human values need us distinguish trade off analytically rather conflate them avoid disguising underlying value-conflicts
two concepts 'negative freedom' freedom interference berlin derived british tradition 'positive freedom' freedom self-mastery asks free free
berlin points out these two different conceptions liberty clash each other
counter-enlightenment main article counter-enlightenment further information three critics enlightenment berlin's writings enlightenment critics especially giambattista vico johann gottfried herder joseph de maistre johann georg hamann whose views berlin referred counter-enlightenment contributed advocacy irreducibly pluralist ethical ontology
three critics enlightenment berlin argues hamann first thinkers conceive human cognition language articulation use symbols
berlin saw hamann having recognised rationalist's cartesian fallacy notion there clear distinct ideas contemplated kind inner eye without use language recognition greatly sharpened 20 th century wittgenstein's private language argument
value pluralism main article value pluralism berlin values creations mankind rather products nature waiting discovered
argued basis epistemic empathetic access other cultures across history nature mankind such certain values importance individual liberty instance will hold true across cultures meant objective pluralism
berlin's argument partly grounded wittgenstein's later theory language argued inter-translatability supervenient similarity forms life inverse implication our epistemic access other cultures entails ontologically contiguous value-structure
account value pluralism proposed view moral values may equally rather incommensurably valid yet incompatible may therefore come conflict another way admits no resolution without reference particular contexts decision
values clash may important other keeping promise may conflict pursuit truth liberty may clash social justice
moral conflicts intrinsic irremovable element human life
these collisions values essence
berlin clashing incommensurate values within no less individuals constitutes tragedy human life
alan brown suggests however berlin ignores fact values commensurable extent contribute human good
