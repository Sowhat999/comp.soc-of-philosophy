four beginnings sprouts show innate goodness mencius used example child falling down well
witnesses event immediately feel “ alarm distress gain friendship child's parents nor seek praise their neighbors friends nor because dislike reputation [of lack humanity rescue child]
feeling commiseration beginning humanity feeling shame dislike beginning righteousness feeling deference compliance beginning propriety feeling right wrong beginning wisdom
men these four beginnings just their four limbs

saying should taken instigation violence against authorities application confucian philosophy society
confucianism requires clarification may reasonably expected any given relationship
relationships should beneficial each own principle inner logic
ruler must justify position acting benevolently before expect reciprocation people
