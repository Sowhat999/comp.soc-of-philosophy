philosophy mind kim defended various mind-body theories during career
began defending version identity theory early 1970 s then moved non-reductive version physicalism relied heavily supervenience relation
recently rejected strict physicalism grounds insufficient basis resolving mind-body problem
particular concluded hard problem consciousness—according detailed comprehensive neurophysical description brain still account fact consciousness—is insurmountable context thoroughgoing physicalism
arguments against physicalism found two latest monographs mind physical world 1998 physicalism something near enough 2005
kim claims physicalism will able survive intact entirety
according kim because qualia phenomenal qualitative aspect mental states cannot reduced physical states processes
kim claims phenomenal mental properties functionally definable hence functionally irreducible functional reduction doesn't work qualia nothing will thus there aspect mind physicalism cannot capture
kim currently defends thesis intentional mental states e
beliefs desires functionally reduced their neurological realizers qualitative phenomenal mental states e
sensations irreducibly non-physical epiphenomenal
thus defends version dualism although kim argues physicalism near enough
march 2008 kim still sees physicalism most comprehensive world view irreplaceable any other world view
2008 interview korean daily newspaper joongang ilbo kim stated must seek naturalistic explanation mind because mind natural phenomenon supernatural explanation provides riddle over another
believes any correct explanation nature mind come natural science rather philosophy psychology
argument against non-reductive physicalism figure demonstration how m1 m2 reduced p1 p2
kim raised objection based causal closure overdetermination non-reductive physicalism
non-reductive physicalist committed following three principles irreducibility mental physical version mental-physical supervenience causal efficaciousness mental states
problem according kim these three commitments combined few other well-accepted principles inconsistency generated entails causal impotence mental properties
first principle most ontological physicalists accept causal closure physical domain according every physical effect sufficient physical cause
second principle kim notes causal exclusion holds no normal event sufficient cause
problem behavior cannot cause both physical event supervening mental event without resulting case overdetermination thus violating principle causal exclusion
result physical causes exclude mental states causally contributing behavior
detail proposes using chart right m1 causes m2 these mental events p1 causes p2 these physical events
m1 p1 supervenience base m2 p2 supervenience base
way m1 cause m2 causing supervenience base p2 case mental-to-physical causation
p1 causes p2 m1 causes p2 then case causal overdetermination
applying principle causal-exclusion either p1 m1 must eliminated cause p2
given principle causal closure physical domain m1 excluded
non-reductive physicalist forced choose two unappealing options reject causal-exclusion principle claim scenario dealing genuine case overdetermination embrace epiphenomenalism
kim argues mental causation preserved rejecting premise irreducibility favor reduction order mental properties considered causally efficacious must reducible physical properties
metaphysics kim's work metaphysics focuses primarily events properties
kim developed event identity theory defended recently
theory holds events identical occur same time place instantiate same property
thus waves ten fingers several events occur including waving even number fingers event waving fingers evenly divisible five evenly divisible ten
criticized theory producing too many events
kim also theorized events structured
known property-exemplification account events
composed three things objects property time temporal interval
events defined using operation [x p t]
[citation needed] unique event defined two principles existence condition identity condition
existence condition states [x p t] exists object x exemplifies n-adic p time t
means unique event exists above met
identity condition states [x p t] [y q t`] x=y p=q t=t`
[citation needed] epistemology kim critic naturalized epistemology popularized willard van orman quine latter half twentieth century
kim's influential article 'naturalized epistemology'? 1988 argues naturalized epistemologies like quine's proper epistemologies merely descriptive scope while generally expects epistemology make normative claims knowledge
kim argues mere description belief-forming practices cannot account justified belief
also argues even individuate beliefs naturalized epistemologist must presuppose normative criteria justification
naturalized epistemology cannot address issue justification therefore does share same aspiration traditional approach epistemology
