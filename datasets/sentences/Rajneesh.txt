teachings osho's teachings delivered through discourses presented academic setting interspersed jokes delivered rhetoric many found spellbinding
emphasis static changed over time osho revelled paradox contradiction making work difficult summarize
delighted engaging behaviour seemed entirely odds traditional images enlightened individuals early lectures particular famous their humor their refusal take anything seriously
such behaviour however capricious difficult accept explained technique transformation push people beyond mind
spoke major spiritual traditions including jainism hinduism hassidism tantrism taoism christianity buddhism variety eastern western mystics sacred scriptures such upanishads guru granth sahib
sociologist lewis f
carter saw ideas rooted hindu advaita human experiences separateness duality temporality held kind dance play cosmic consciousness everything sacred absolute worth end itself
while contemporary jiddu krishnamurti approve osho there clear similarities their respective teachings
osho also drew wide range western ideas
view unity opposites recalls heraclitus while description man machine condemned helpless acting out unconscious neurotic patterns much common freud gurdjieff
vision new man transcending constraints convention reminiscent nietzsche's beyond good evil views sexual liberation bear comparison
lawrence dynamic meditations owe debt wilhelm reich
ego mind according osho every human being buddha capacity enlightenment capable unconditional love responding rather reacting life although ego usually prevents identifying social conditioning creating false needs conflicts illusory sense identity nothing barrier dreams
otherwise man's innate being flower move periphery centre
osho views mind first foremost mechanism survival replicating behavioral strategies proven successful past
mind's appeal past deprives human beings ability live authentically present causing them repress genuine emotions shut themselves off joyful experiences arise naturally embracing present moment mind no inherent capacity joy
thinks joy
result people poison themselves manner neuroses jealousies insecurities
argued psychological repression often advocated religious leaders makes suppressed feelings re-emerge another guise sexual repression resulted societies obsessed sex
instead suppressing people should trust accept themselves unconditionally
should merely understood intellectually mind assimilate piece information instead meditation needed
meditation osho presented meditation just practice state awareness maintained every moment total awareness awakens individual sleep mechanical responses conditioned beliefs expectations
employed western psychotherapy preparatory stages meditation create awareness mental emotional patterns
suggested hundred meditation techniques total
own active meditation techniques characterised stages physical activity leading silence
most famous these remains dynamic meditation described kind microcosm outlook
performed closed blindfolded eyes comprises five stages four accompanied music
first meditator engages ten minutes rapid breathing through nose
second ten minutes catharsis let whatever happening happen
laugh shout scream jump shake—whatever you feel it! next ten minutes jumps up down arms raised shouting hoo! each time lands flat feet
fourth silent stage meditator stops moving suddenly totally remaining completely motionless fifteen minutes witnessing everything happening
last stage meditation consists fifteen minutes dancing celebration
osho developed other active meditation techniques such kundalini shaking meditation nadabrahma humming meditation less animated although also include physical activity sort another
later meditative therapies require sessions several days osho mystic rose comprising three hours laughing every day week three hours weeping each day second week third week three hours silent meditation
these processes witnessing enable jump awareness
osho believed such cathartic methods necessary since difficult modern people just sit enter meditation
once methods provided glimpse meditation people able use other methods without difficulty
sannyas another key ingredient own presence master master shares being you philosophy
never does anything disciple
initiation offered another such device
your being communicate me becomes communion
highest form communication possible transmission without words
our beings merge
possible you become disciple
ultimately though explicitly self-parodying guru osho even deconstructed own authority declaring teaching nothing game joke
emphasized anything everything become opportunity meditation
renunciation new man osho saw neo-sannyas totally new form spiritual discipline once existed since forgotten
thought traditional hindu sannyas turned mere system social renunciation imitation
emphasized complete inner freedom responsibility oneself demanding superficial behavioral changes deeper inner transformation
desires accepted surpassed rather denied
once inner flowering taken place desires such sex left behind
osho rich man's guru material poverty genuine spiritual value
himself photographed wearing sumptuous clothing hand-made watches while oregon drove different rolls-royce each day followers reportedly wanted buy 365 them each day year
publicity shots rolls-royces sent press
may reflected both advocacy wealth desire provoke american sensibilities much enjoyed offending indian sensibilities earlier
osho aimed create new man combining spirituality gautama buddha zest life embodied nikos kazantzakis' zorba greek should accurate objective scientist
sensitive full heart poet
[and as] rooted deep down being mystic
term new man applied men women equally whose roles saw complementary indeed most movement's leadership positions held women
new man zorba buddha should reject neither science nor spirituality embrace both
osho believed humanity threatened extinction due over-population impending nuclear holocaust diseases such aids thought many society's ills remedied scientific means
new man no longer trapped institutions such family marriage political ideologies religions
respect osho similar other counter-culture gurus perhaps even certain postmodern deconstructional thinkers
euthanasia crippled blind deaf dumb children genetic selection osho spoke many times favor dangers over-population advocated universal legalization contraception abortion
spoke religious prohibitions thereof criminal
argued once united nations' declaration human right life played hands religious campaigners really no right knowingly inflict lifetime suffering life should begin birth even then child born deaf dumb cannot anything parents willing child should put eternal sleep people don't permission existence take risk burdening earth crippled blind child stating body goes back basic elements soul will fly another womb
nothing destroyed
you really love child you will want live seventy-year-long life misery suffering sickness old age
even child born medically capable enjoying life fully senses healthy then better goes eternal sleep born somewhere else better body
then stated ultimately decision child should medical matter ultimately oversight population genetics must awarded science medicine lest fall power politicians genetics hands joseph stalin adolf hitler benito mussolini will fate world? once know how change program thousands possibilities open up
give every man woman best everything
there no need anyone suffer unnecessarily
being retarded crippled blind ugly these will possible change
homosexuality perversion / segregation relocation homosexuals osho criticized adult homosexuality rejected idea may born homosexual
also stated homosexuality caused aids epidemic
according osho homosexuals because perverted created disease aids also suggested rather being imprisoned homosexuals should given different localities
live their own world their own way happy should allowed move wider society spreading kinds dangerous viruses
asked gay sannyasin explain stance osho further reinforced view stating according homosexual you even human being [
you fallen dignity
osho's ten commandments early days acharya rajneesh correspondent once asked osho ten commandments
reply osho noted difficult matter because against any kind commandment just fun set out following “ never obey anyone's command unless coming within you also
there no god other life itself
truth within you search elsewhere
love prayer
become nothingness door truth
nothingness itself means goal attainment
life now here
live wakefully
die each moment you new each moment
stop see
