activities hawza ilmiyya najaf hawza najaf grew immensely under marjaiyya
historic opinion piece although official fatwa branding communism kufr atheism proved beginning end communism iraq
muhsin al-hakim led hawza also known marja'iyya group shi'i scholars based najaf responsible determining shi'i religious doctrine during time considerable tumult iraq
communism enveloped south iraq iraqi nationalist parties most prominently pan-arabist ba'ath party largely control iraq's political institutions particularly during last decade hakim's life
important note however hawza papacy therefore leading does mean hakim alone pronounce shi'i doctrine members hawza sufficient standing namely those given title absolute interpreter mujtahid mutlaq developed their own rules based accepted techniques practices
hakim simply most respected relatively small group scholars
political stances hakim's general stance respect these movements contradistinction those children later became extraordinarily active politically quietism
fact shi'i quietism later exemplified hawza leaders such grand ayatollah abul qasim al-khoei current grand ayatollah ali sistani probably reached apotheosis iraq during hakim's tenure
thus while hakim attempt limit communist influence among shi'a banning their participation party most part preferred remain out politics least tacitly agreeing baghdad's rulers keep hawza's scholars politically neutral exchange relative immunity those scholars
implicit stance certain alienation disaffection notion modern nation state exercise political authority
state politics assumed inherently sullying something good shi'is should avoid
quietism thus secularism state religion presumed important separate spheres influence rather type devotion religious authorities suspicion political ones
politics religion then united once again after return hidden mahdi now disappeared over millennium
mahdi lineal descendant prophet muhammad imam shi'i theology infallible individual whom political religious authority muslim community vested will ultimately bring justice world reappearance under shi'i eschatological theory
other point view there within hawza less enamored hakim's stance respecting political authority
muhammad baqir al-sadr example junior member hawza during hakim's time sought series reforms hawza make politically palatable appealing shi'i masses proving susceptible communism
sadr therefore tried unify centralize hawza placing power hands senior scholar sought make materials accessible understandable lay community filled arcane obscure language often minutiae no interest broader shi'i masses
helped found da'wa party well islamist party sadr imagined give hawza political influence baghdad
while hakim great deal respect intelligence enthusiasm sadr viewed political activism contrary principles interests
hakim therefore asked sadr dissociate relationship da'wa generally discouraged efforts reform large parts hawza curriculum though important reforms undertaken
hakim therefore maintained quietist balance through very difficult times ultimately projected stance politics religion shi'i community remains influential today
hakim's death sadr's activism increased ultimately ideas proved too threatening saddam government
1980 sister killed saddam hussein's interrogators any members hawza inclined take sadr's politically active position
fall saddam hussein regime however shi'ism reached considerable period ferment religious community attempting achieve form balance political activism announced sadr quietist stance embodied most clearly form muhsin al-hakim
