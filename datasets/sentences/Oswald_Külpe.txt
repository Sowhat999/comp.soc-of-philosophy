würzburg school key area focus development formation concepts
külpe students expanded use introspection first research thought processes using experimental methods watson 1978
doing developed improved process became known systematic experimental introspection retrospective reporting experiences subject after performing complex task involving thinking remembering judging
abstraction experiments especially important distinguishing relevant features objects individuals differing stages development
throughout time würzburg acted devoted teacher administrator
fact most prestige comes dedication students hard work directed towards teaching duties
though published many own personal works külpe never penned any traditional würzburg papers difficult specify personal interpretation work school
however many personal works often anticipated notions later discussed students
külpe managed exert influence field psychology via students
max wertheimer founder gestalt psychology undoubtedly most famous student
however other noteworthy students include narziß ach henry watt both whom worked concept mental set robert morris ogden played major role introducing gestalt psychology united states kurt koffka founders gestalt school
distinct view wundt würzburg school developed innovational holistic view focus studying both act content
research established strong foundation gestalt psychologists come
research notable contributions psychology made würzburg school
emphasis motivation role plays results thinking stressed school still relevant today
today still widely accepted principle motivation variable affects thinking outcomes
another contribution school theory behaviour ‘id’ depended element within thinker’s consciousness there unconscious determinants behaviour well
another notable idea born würzburg school still relevant widely accepted psychology today
imageless thought perhaps most famous psychological contribution come out würzburg laboratory related külpe’s philosophical realism beliefs
work focused idea imageless thought belief there objective significance found within experiences necessarily associated specific words symbols signs
külpe anticipated notion imageless thought early work evidenced gundriss psychologie
used experiment demonstrate our ability recognize something seen before unrelated whether remember image
demonstrative experiment took participants darkened room asked them visualize colors called them out
situations participants able visualize colors
participant unable visualize colors no cognitive deficits lead külpe conclusion recognition independent remembrance külpe believed research thought processes up point including wundt’s study associations thoughts images incomplete
influenced interest philosophy külpe believed there certain sensations feelings presentations neither described nor associated mind image
once given opportunity objectively self-observe describe neither sensation feeling nor presentation yet still thought process külpe colleagues identified need new definitions concepts aside those already exist
example külpe students
mayer j
orth identified following presentation stimulus word “meter” indescribable conscious process occurred led subject responding word “trochee”
proposed indicated wundt wrong belief events thought process either associated direct images
their research although imperfect using systematic experimental introspection methods külpe students developed refined established foundation imageless thought research still relevant debated within field psychology today
abstraction attention early 1900 s külpe performed experiments concept abstraction würzburg school
külpe defined abstraction process focuses certain aspects reality while ignoring others
famous experiment külpe instructed participants observe display numbers letters colors shapes
example participants beforehand report numbers observed then unable describe letters colors shapes any accuracy after experiment
participants describe colors then subsequent questioning unable describe letters numbers shapes
item people describe highest level accuracy item instructed observe
these results indicated subjects experiment abstract requested features while same time remaining “unconscious” other present features
külpe letter conclusions these experiments old doctrine inner sense involved idea distinction reality consciousness objectivity must now opportune renewal domain psychology
principal conclusion draw my experiments
connection there define abstraction process logically psychologically effective separated logically psychologically ineffective
effective partial contents positively abstracted thinking ideation
ineffective those abstraction made
our consciousness therefore there abstract ideas psychical reality there concrete ideas
same time old controversy nominalism realism approaches solution
another letter külpe identified key distinction ideas compared wundt’s ideas
külpe differentiates 'thought' 'thinking'
thoughts 'contents’ argues whereas thinking various forms such meaning judging concluding considered acts functions
case contents thoughts themselves whereas acts functions thinking process
külpe function content different independently variable
proposed acts functions analyzable consciousness relatively unstable observed known after event occurred
order observe them külpe’s process systematic experimental introspection critical
külpe believed contents other hand analyzable consciousness observable introspection relatively stable
also cautioned against speculating occurring physiologically time thinking
instead külpe encouraged finding improving facts subject
ignore physiological processes occurring part thinking process instead introspect upon you know occurred
result experiment külpe determined visual perception determined external stimulation also aufgabe another word task directive
since varied aufgabe task slightly each session experiment able find correlation range attention degree consciousness
found wider one’s span attention lower one’s degree consciousness any specific aspect vice versa
concluded there limited amount energy driving attention limitation constant
also concluded abstraction process based apprehension rather sensational differences presentation these two concepts distinct
mental set külpe würzburg associates also used abstraction experiments reject associationism elementary thinking method
example situations participants asked provide superordinate category superior group within classification system birds likely respond saying ‘animal’ specific bird such ‘hummingbird
’ result külpe students würzburg laboratory concluded behavior such above example explained according associationistic logic
determined actual task instead stimulus directs thinking process
mechanism became known mental set
specifically mental set refers innate tendency respond certain way
eventually mental set seen factor account large portion variation ways people solve problems
major works oswald külpe’s books published works cover variety subject matter impacted interest psychology

lack focus concept thought book interesting because würzburg school greatly researched mental set imageless thought
once colleague however concepts behind book “the source investigations psychology thinking

book külpe also looks relations body mind doing takes dualistic position
külpe also gives clearly describes relationship physical psychical other words natural science psychology

book less 350 pages went through seven editions four translations including english w
pillsbury titchener under title introduction philosophy
1912 külpe published über die moderne psychologie des denkens translates english modern psychology thinking
book looking back upon focus systematic experimental introspection method
believed before systematic experimental introspection existed research thought incomplete
also believed having subject report sensations feelings presentations thought research severely limiting provide acceptable opportunity identify considered neither sensation feeling nor presentation
once given opportunity objectively self-observe describe neither sensation feeling nor presentation yet still thought process külpe colleagues identified need new definitions concepts aside those already exist
külpe “the subjects began speak language life assign less importance presentations their inner world
knew thought judged understood grasped meaning saw connections without receiving any real help occasionally occurring imagery
