gould five years old father took hall dinosaurs american museum natural history first encountered tyrannosaurus rex
no idea there such things—i awestruck gould once recalled
moment decided become paleontologist
raised secular jewish home gould formally practice religion preferred called agnostic
biologist jerry coyne gould thesis committee described diehard atheist there ever
gould's personal friend oliver sacks called jewish atheist
asked whether agnostic interview skeptic magazine responded you absolutely forced me bet existence conventional anthropomorphic deity course i'd bet no
basically huxley right agnosticism honorable position because really cannot know
that's right
i'd real surprised there turned out conventional god
remember story clarence darrow quite atheistic
somebody asked suppose you die your soul goes up there turns out conventional story true after all? darrow's answer beautiful love way pictured 12 apostles jury box reputation giving long speeches spoke two straight days save leopold loeb
once life wasn't going make long speech
just going walk up them bow low judge's bench say gentlemen wrong
though brought up marxist father stated father's politics very different own

first bout cancer july 1982 gould diagnosed peritoneal mesothelioma deadly form cancer affecting abdominal lining frequently found people exposed asbestos rock dust
after difficult two-year recovery gould published column discover magazine entitled median isn't message discusses reaction discovering people mesothelioma median lifespan eight months after diagnosis
then describes true significance behind number relief upon realizing statistical averages just useful abstractions encompass full range variation
median halfway point means 50% people will die before eight months other half will live longer potentially much longer
then needed determine personal characteristics placed within range
given cancer detected early fact young optimistic best treatments available gould concluded should favorable half upper statistical range
after experimental treatment radiation chemotherapy surgery gould made full recovery column became source comfort many people cancer
gould also advocate medical marijuana
cancer smoked drug alleviate nausea associated medical treatments
according gould use marijuana most important effect eventual recovery

punctuated equilibrium main article punctuated equilibrium early career gould niles eldredge developed theory punctuated equilibrium according evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly alternating longer periods relative evolutionary stability
although gould coined term punctuated equilibria idea first presented eldredge's doctoral dissertation devonian trilobites article published previous year allopatric speciation
according gould punctuated equilibrium revised key pillar central logic darwinian theory
evolutionary biologists argued while punctuated equilibrium great interest biology merely modified neo-darwinism manner fully compatible known before
example george gaylord simpson tempo mode evolution 1941 described evolutionary history being characterized mostly gradual change horotely also included slow bradytely rapid tachytely rates evolution
other biologists emphasize theoretical novelty punctuated equilibrium argued evolutionary stasis unexpected most evolutionary biologists major impact paleontology evolutionary biology
critics jokingly referred theory punctuated equilibrium evolution jerks prompted gould describe phyletic gradualism evolution creeps
evolutionary developmental biology illustration 1971 article biological homage mickey mouse gould gould made significant contributions evolutionary developmental biology especially work ontogeny phylogeny
book emphasized process heterochrony encompasses two distinct processes neoteny terminal additions
neoteny process ontogeny slowed down organism does reach end development
terminal addition process organism adds development speeding shortening earlier stages developmental process
gould's influence field evolutionary developmental biology continues seen such areas study evolution feathers
selectionism sociobiology gould championed biological constraints such limitations developmental pathways evolutionary outcomes well other non-selectionist forces evolution
particular considered many higher functions human brain unintended side consequence by-product natural selection rather direct adaptations
describe such co-opted features coined term exaptation elisabeth vrba
gould believed understanding undermines essential premise human sociobiology evolutionary psychology
against sociobiology 1975 gould's harvard colleague e
wilson introduced analysis animal behavior including human behavior based sociobiological framework suggested many social behaviors strong evolutionary basis
response gould richard lewontin others boston area subsequently well-referenced letter new york review books entitled against 'sociobiology'
open letter criticized wilson's notion deterministic view human society human action
gould rule out sociobiological explanations many aspects animal behavior later sociobiologists broadened their range selective stories invoking concepts inclusive fitness kin selection solve successfully think vexatious problem altruism—previously greatest stumbling block darwinian theory social behavior
here sociobiology will continue success
here wish well
represents extension basic darwinism realm should apply
spandrels panglossian paradigm spandrel holy trinity church fulnek czech republic
richard lewontin gould influential 1979 paper entitled spandrels san marco panglossian paradigm introduced architectural term spandrel evolutionary biology
architecture spandrel curved area masonry exists arches supporting dome
spandrels also called pendentives context found particularly gothic churches
visiting venice 1978 gould noted spandrels san marco cathedral while quite beautiful spaces planned architect
rather spaces arise necessary architectural byproducts mounting dome rounded arches
gould lewontin thus defined spandrels evolutionary biology context mean any biological feature organism arises necessary side consequence other features directly selected natural selection
proposed examples include masculinized genitalia female hyenas exaptive use umbilicus brooding chamber snails shoulder hump giant irish deer several key features human mentality
voltaire's candide dr
pangloss portrayed clueless scholar despite evidence insists best best possible worlds
gould lewontin asserted panglossian evolutionary biologists view traits atomized things naturally selected criticised biologists granting theoretical space other causes such phyletic developmental constraints
relative frequency spandrels defined versus adaptive features nature remains controversial topic evolutionary biology
illustrative example gould's approach found elisabeth lloyd's case study suggesting female orgasm by-product shared developmental pathways
gould also topic essay male nipples clitoral ripples prompted lloyd's earlier work
evolutionary progress gould favored argument evolution no inherent drive towards long-term progress
uncritical commentaries often portray evolution ladder progress leading towards bigger faster smarter organisms assumption being evolution somehow driving organisms get complex ultimately like humankind
gould argued evolution's drive towards complexity towards diversification
because life constrained begin simple starting point like bacteria any diversity resulting start random walk will skewed distribution therefore perceived move direction higher complexity
life gould argued also easily adapt towards simplification often case parasites
review full house richard dawkins approved gould's general argument suggested saw evidence tendency lineages improve cumulatively their adaptive fit their particular way life increasing numbers features combine together adaptive complexes
definition adaptive evolution just incidentally progressive deeply dyed-in-the-wool indispensably progressive
cladistics gould never embraced cladistics method investigating evolutionary lineages process possibly because concerned such investigations lead neglect details historical biology considered all-important
early 1990 s led debate derek briggs begun apply quantitative cladistic techniques burgess shale fossils methods used interpreting these fossils
around time cladistics rapidly became dominant method classification evolutionary biology
inexpensive increasingly powerful personal computers made possible process large quantities data organisms their characteristics
around same time development effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made possible apply cladistic methods analysis biochemical genetic features well
technical work land snails drawing cerion snail most gould's empirical research pertained land snails
focused early work bermudian genus poecilozonites while later work concentrated west indian genus cerion
according gould cerion land snail maximal diversity form throughout entire world
there 600 described species single genus
fact they're really species interbreed names exist express real phenomenon incredible morphological diversity
shaped like golf balls shaped like pencils
now my main subject evolution form problem how you get diversity amid little genetic difference far tell very interesting
solve we'd learn something general evolution form
given cerion's extensive geographic diversity gould later lamented christopher columbus cataloged single cerion ended scholarly debate island columbus first set foot america
influence gould most frequently cited scientists field evolutionary theory
1979 spandrels paper cited 4000 times
paleobiology—the flagship journal own speciality—only charles darwin george gaylord simpson cited often
gould also considerably respected historian science
historian ronald numbers quoted saying can't say much gould's strengths scientist long time i've regarded second most influential historian science next thomas kuhn
structure evolutionary theory shortly before death gould published long treatise recapitulating version modern evolutionary theory structure evolutionary theory 2002
public figure gould became widely known through popular essays evolution natural history magazine
essays published series titled view life phrase concluding paragraph charles darwin's origin species starting january 1974 ended january 2001 amounting continuous publication 300 essays
many essays reprinted collected volumes became bestselling books such ever since darwin panda's thumb hen's teeth horse's toes flamingo's smile
passionate advocate evolutionary theory gould prolifically subject trying communicate understanding contemporary evolutionary biology wide audience
recurring theme writings history development pre-evolutionary evolutionary thought
also enthusiastic baseball fan sabermetrician made frequent reference sport essays
many baseball essays anthologized posthumously published book triumph tragedy mudville 2003
although proud darwinist gould's emphasis less gradualist reductionist most neo-darwinists
fiercely opposed many aspects sociobiology intellectual descendant evolutionary psychology
devoted considerable time fighting against creationism creation science intelligent design
most notably gould provided expert testimony against equal-time creationism law mc lean v
gould later developed term non-overlapping magisteria noma describe how view science religion comment each other's realm
gould went develop idea detail particularly books rocks ages 1999 hedgehog fox magister's pox 2003
1982 essay natural history gould our failure discern universal good does record any lack insight ingenuity merely demonstrates nature contains no moral messages framed human terms
morality subject philosophers theologians students humanities indeed thinking people
answers will read passively nature cannot arise data science
factual state world does teach us how our powers good evil should alter preserve most ethical manner
anti-evolution petition scientific dissent darwinism spawned national center science education's pro-evolution counterpart project steve named gould's honor
gould also became noted public face science often appearing television
1984 gould received own nova special pbs
other appearances included interviews cnn's crossfire nbc's today show regular appearances charlie rose show
gould also guest seven episodes dutch talk series glorious accident appeared oliver sacks
gould featured prominently guest ken burns's pbs documentary baseball well pbs's evolution series
gould also board advisers influential children's television workshop television show 3-2-1 contact made frequent guest appearances
1997 voiced cartoon version himself television series simpsons

fossil discovered marketing gimmick new mall
during production phrase gould objected line script introduced world's most brilliant paleontologist
2002 show paid tribute gould after death dedicating season 13 finale memory
gould died two days before episode aired
controversy gould received many accolades scholarly work popular expositions natural history immune criticism biologists felt public presentations out step mainstream evolutionary theory
public debates gould's supporters detractors quarrelsome dubbed darwin wars several commentators
john maynard smith eminent british evolutionary biologist among gould's strongest critics
maynard smith thought gould misjudged vital role adaptation biology critical gould's acceptance species selection major component biological evolution
review daniel dennett's book darwin's dangerous idea maynard smith gould giving non-biologists largely false picture state evolutionary theory
maynard smith consistently negative writing review panda's thumb stephen gould best writer popular science now active
often infuriates me hope will go right writing essays like these
maynard smith also among those welcomed gould's reinvigoration evolutionary paleontology
reason criticism gould appeared presenting ideas revolutionary way understanding evolution argued importance mechanisms other natural selection mechanisms believed ignored many professional evolutionists
result many non-specialists sometimes inferred early writings darwinian explanations proven unscientific gould never tried imply
along many other researchers field gould's works sometimes deliberately taken out context creationists proof scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved
gould himself corrected these misinterpretations distortions writings later works
documented kim sterelny among others gould disagreed richard dawkins importance gene selection evolution
dawkins argued evolution best understood competition among genes replicators while gould advocated importance multi-level selection including selection amongst genes cell lineages organisms demes species clades
dawkins also gould deliberately played down difference rapid gradualism macromutation theory punctuated equilibrium
criticism gould theory punctuated equilibrium found dawkins's blind watchmaker unweaving rainbow well chapter 10 dennett's darwin's dangerous idea
cambrian fauna gould's interpretation cambrian burgess shale fossils book wonderful life emphasized striking morphological disparity weirdness burgess shale fauna role chance determining members fauna survived flourished
used cambrian fauna example role contingency broader pattern evolution
view criticized simon conway morris 1998 book crucible creation
conway morris stressed those members cambrian fauna resemble modern taxa
also promoted convergent evolution mechanism producing similar forms similar environmental circumstances argued subsequent book appearance human-like animals likely
paleontologists derek briggs richard fortey also argued much cambrian fauna may regarded stem groups living taxa though still subject intense research debate relationship many cambrian taxa modern phyla established eyes many palaeontologists
paleontologist richard fortey noted prior release wonderful life conway morris shared many gould's sentiments views
after publication wonderful life conway morris revised interpretation adopted progressive stance towards history life
richard dawkins also disagreed gould's interpretation burgess shale arguing extreme gouldian view—certainly view inspired rhetoric though hard tell own words whether literally holds himself—is radically different utterly incompatible standard neo-darwinian model
new body plan—a new phylum—to spring existence actually happen ground child born suddenly out blue different parents snail earthworm
no zoologist thinks through implications even most ardent saltationist ever supported any such notion
opposition sociobiology evolutionary psychology gould also long-running public feud e
wilson other evolutionary biologists concerning disciplines human sociobiology evolutionary psychology both gould lewontin opposed richard dawkins daniel dennett steven pinker advocated
these debates reached their climax 1970 s included strong opposition groups like sociobiology study group science people
pinker accuses gould lewontin other opponents evolutionary psychology being radical scientists whose stance human nature influenced politics rather science
gould stated made no attribution motive wilson's anyone else's case cautioned human beings influenced especially unconsciously our personal expectations biases
grew up family tradition participation campaigns social justice active student civil rights movement time great excitement success early 1960 s
scholars often wary citing such commitments
… [but] dangerous scholar even imagine might attain complete neutrality then stops being vigilant personal preferences their influences—and then truly falls victim dictates prejudice
objectivity must operationally defined fair treatment data absence preference
gould's primary criticism held human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support argued adaptive behaviors frequently assumed genetic no other reason their supposed universality their adaptive nature
gould emphasized adaptive behaviors passed through culture well either hypothesis equally plausible
gould deny relevance biology human nature reframed debate biological potentiality vs
biological determinism
gould stated human brain allows wide range behaviors
flexibility permits us aggressive peaceful dominant submissive spiteful generous… violence sexism general nastiness biological since represent subset possible range behaviors
peacefulness equality kindness just biological—and may see their influence increase create social structures permit them flourish
mismeasure man main article mismeasure man gould author mismeasure man 1981 history inquiry psychometrics intelligence testing generating perhaps greatest controversy books receiving both widespread praise extensive criticism including claims misrepresentation
gould investigated methods nineteenth century craniometry well history psychological testing
gould claimed both theories developed unfounded belief biological determinism view social economic differences human groups—primarily races classes sexes—arise inherited inborn distinctions society sense accurate reflection biology
book reprinted 1996 addition new foreword critical review bell curve
2011 study conducted six anthropologists reanalyzed gould's claim samuel morton unconsciously manipulated skull measurements concluded gould's analysis poorly supported incorrect
praised gould staunch opposition racism concluded find morton's initial reputation objectivist era well-deserved
ralph holloway co-authors study commented just didn't trust gould
feeling ideological stance supreme
1996 version 'the mismeasure man' came never even bothered mention michael's study just felt charlatan
group's paper reviewed journal nature recommended degree caution notes because couldn't measure skulls know whether average cranial capacities morton reported represent sample accurately
journal stated gould's opposition racism may biased interpretation morton's data also noted lewis colleagues their own motivations
several group association university pennsylvania interest seeing valuable understudied skull collection freed stigma bias
group's paper critically reviewed journal evolution & development philosopher science michael weisberg also university pennsylvania
weisberg argues most gould's arguments against morton sound
although gould made errors overstated case number places provided prima facia evidence yet unrefuted morton indeed mismeasure skulls ways conformed 19 th century racial biases
biologists philosophers jonathan kaplan massimo pigliucci joshua alexander banta also published critique groups's paper arguing many claims misleading re-measurements completely irrelevant evaluation gould's published analysis
also argued methods deployed morton gould both inappropriate gould's statistical analysis morton's data many ways no better morton's own
non-overlapping magisteria main article non-overlapping magisteria book rocks ages 1999 gould put forward described blessedly simple entirely conventional resolution
supposed conflict science religion
defines term magisterium domain form teaching holds appropriate tools meaningful discourse resolution
non-overlapping magisteria noma principle therefore divides magisterium science cover empirical realm universe made fact why does work way theory
magisterium religion extends over questions ultimate meaning moral value
these two magisteria overlap nor encompass inquiry
suggests noma enjoys strong fully explicit support even primary cultural stereotypes hard-line traditionalism noma sound position general consensus established long struggle among people goodwill both magisteria
however view without criticism
example book god delusion richard dawkins argues division religion science simple gould claims few religions exist without claiming existence miracles definition violate principles science
dawkins also opposes idea religion anything meaningful say ethics values therefore no authority claim magisterium own
goes say believes gould disingenuous much says rocks ages
similarly humanist philosopher paul kurtz argues gould wrong posit science nothing say questions ethics
fact kurtz claims science much better method religion determining moral principles

these first two paragraphs notes unpublished letter editor new york review books leda cosmides john tooby 7 july 1997
comment two nyrb articles gould june 12
john maynard smith world's leading evolutionary biologists recently summarized nyrb sharply conflicting assessments stephen jay gould because excellence essays come seen non-biologists pre-eminent evolutionary theorist
contrast evolutionary biologists whom discussed work tend see man whose ideas confused hardly worth bothering should publicly criticized because least our side against creationists
nyrb november 30 1995 p
no take any pleasure evident pain gould experiencing now actual standing within community professional evolutionary biologists finally becoming widely known
stake solely man's self-regard common decency preclude comment
maynard smith points out stake
gould giving non-biologists largely false picture state evolutionary theory—or ernst mayr says gould small group allies—they quite conspicuously misrepresent views [biology's] leading spokesmen
indeed although gould characterizes critics anonymous tiny coterie nearly every major evolutionary biologist our era weighed vain attempt correct tangle confusions higher profile gould inundated intellectual world

first two articles provoked tooby cosmides gould commented november 1995 review work maynard smith gould darwinian fundamentalism new york review books june 12 1997 34–37
false fact refuted false argument exposed how respond purely ad hominem attack? harder altogether discouraging task may best achieved exposing internal inconsistency unfairness rhetoric
[quotation smith's criticism gould november 1995 nyrb] seems futile reply attack empty content based comments anonymous critics [
instead responding maynard smith's attack against my integrity scholarship citing people unknown arguments unmentioned let me instead merely remind blatant inconsistency admirable past lamentable present
sixteen years ago highly critical wonderfully supportive review my early book essays panda's thumb stating hope will obvious my wish argue gould compliment criticism
then attended my series tanner lectures cambridge 1984 report nature under remarkable title paleontology high table kindest most supportive critical commentary ever received
argued work small group american paleobiologists brought entire subject back theoretical centrality within evolutionary sciences
face enigma man written numerous articles amounting tens thousands words my work—always strongly incisively critical richly informed might add enormously appreciated me
now maynard smith needs canvass unnamed colleagues find out my ideas hardly worth bothering
really ought asking himself why bothering my work intensely many years
