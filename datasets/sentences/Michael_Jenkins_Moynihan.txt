reception controversy due interpretations particular comments moynihan made imagery employed michael moynihan controversial figure
matthias gardell swedish professor matthias gardell writes gods blood featured different contexts moynihan projects many different faces classified extreme rightist coogan 1999 extreme leftist wulfing 1995 nazi fascist anarchist
gardell also writes moynihan developed early interest things beyond ordinary extremist politics occult sciences
intelligent energetic creative inquisitiveness soon began manifest music art writings
people whom moynihan attracted ideas gardell lists charles manson muammar al-gaddafi mikhail bakunin julius evola james mason miguel serrano
accordance main theses book conventional left wing-right wing binary become increasingly insufficient map out scene contemporary politics gardell concludes moynihan may best described heathen anarchofascist paradoxes ambiguities follow such categorization
mattias gardell further writes while certainly [moynihan] does care majority mankind cares even less building gas chambers moynihan hardly anti-semitic white supremacist definitely radical right 'leader' anything
kevin coogan investigative journalist kevin coogan linked moynihan explicitly extreme right states moynihan does fit conventional definitions fascism
coogan classified moynihan unspecifically extreme rightist
coogan states lords chaos yet really makes book fascinating main author michael moynihan himself extreme rightist whose fusion politics aesthetic violence shapes not-so-hidden sub current runs throughout loc
coogan states lords chaos itself however fascist tract strict sense since moynihan co-wrote didrik søderlind feral house editor adam parfrey wanted publish popular book black metal political polemic
coogan then points out nor does moynihan himself fit easily conventional definitions fascism

section report regarding moynihan criticized decibel magazine 2006 stated main problem particular part article—besides being totally misleading—is blood axis black metal band
rather interview moynihan authors article excerpted quotes issue compulsion zine published 1998
moynihan responded report “regarding their attacks me these too packed misinformation outright errors” moynihan adds
“they ignore my artistic work whole—it’s clear they’ve never even listened records they’re condemning—and merely focus few provocative statements selectively culled interviews done nearly 15 years ago
these statements become far ambiguous contextualized everything i’ve done over years
very beginning blood axis represents grey area nietzschean amorality paradox inability people handle even grasp these terms proves how successfully embodies
