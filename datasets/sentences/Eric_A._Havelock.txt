well known these philosophical texts parmenides empedocles written verse metre homer recently identified still controversially time milman parry oral poet cornford other scholars these early philosophers saw practice fairly insignificant convention leftover hesiod
havelock eventually came conclusion poetic aspects early philosophy matters style substance such thinkers heraclitus empedocles actually common even intellectual level homer plato aristotle
however publicly break cornford until many years later
1926 havelock took first academic job acadia university nova scotia canada
married ellen parkinson 1927 moved victoria college university toronto 1929
havelock's scholarly work during period focused latin poetry particularly catullus far early greek philosophy worked cambridge
while canada havelock became increasingly involved politics
fellow academics frank underhill eugene forsey havelock cofounder league social reconstruction organisation politically active socialist intellectuals
underhill also most outspoken group dissident faculty members university
havelock's political engagement deepened rapidly
1931 after toronto police blocked public meeting organisation police claimed associated communists underhill public letter protest calling action short-sighted inexpedient intolerable
letter led considerable tension leadership university activist professors led havelock underhill well sharply critical public reaction
major newspapers toronto along number prominent business leaders denounced professors radical leftists their behaviour unbecoming academics
though league social reconstruction began discussion group political party became force canadian politics mid-1930 s
after havelock joined co-operative commonwealth federation along several other members league pressured superiors university curtail political activity
continuing act ally occasional spokesman underhill other leftist professors
found himself trouble again 1937 after criticising both government's industry's handling automotive workers' strike
despite calls ontario officials ouster able remain victoria college public reputation badly damaged

theall called toronto school communications
havelock's work complemented harold innis working history media
work havelock innis began 1930 s preliminary basis influential theories communication developed marshall mc luhan edmund snow carpenter 1950 s
during world war ii havelock moved away socialist organisations associated 1944 elected founding president ontario classical association
association's first activities organising relief effort greece just liberated nazi control
havelock continued write politics however political academic work came together ideas education argued necessity understanding rhetoric resistance corporate persuasiveness
toward new theory greek intellectual history attic cup inscribed greek alphabet
havelock argued simplicity spacing alphabet crucial development literate culture
same time becoming increasingly vocal visible politics havelock's scholarly work moving toward concerns occupy bulk career
first questions raised relationship literacy orality greece concerned nature historical socrates long-debated issue
havelock's position drawn analyses xenophon aristophanes well plato himself plato's presentation teacher largely fiction intended transparent whose purpose represent indirectly plato's own ideas
argued vociferously against idea associated john burnet still currency time basic model theory forms originated socrates
havelock's argument drew evidence historical change greek philosophy plato argued fundamentally writing ideas present past
most earlier work field assumed since plato uses socrates mouthpiece own philosophical concerns must similar those debated athens youth socrates teacher
havelock's contention socrates plato belonged different philosophical eras first instance become central work basic shift kinds ideas being discussed intellectuals methods discussing them happened point end fifth century bc middle fourth
1947 havelock moved cambridge massachusetts take position harvard university remained until 1963
active number aspects university department became chair undertook translation commentary aeschylus' prometheus bound benefit students
published translation extended commentary prometheus myth's implications history under title crucifixion intellectual man then changed back prometheus book republished 1960 s saying earlier title come seem bit pretentious
during time began first major attempt argue division platonic aristotelian philosophy came before
focus political philosophy particular beginnings greek liberalism introduced democritus
book liberal temper greek politics argued democritus liberals political theory based understanding behaviour man cosmic historical setting humanity defined poets define it—measured through individual actions
plato aristotle interested nature humanity particular idea human actions might rooted inherent qualities rather consisting individual choices
arguing basic heuristic split plato contemporaries democritus havelock directly contradicting very long tradition philosophy painstakingly assembled innumerable connections plato pre-socratics reinforce position plato own dialogues imply primarily informed teacher socrates socrates turn willing participant philosophical conversation already several hundred years old again seeming endorsement plato shows young socrates conversing learning pre-socratics parmenides zeno dialogue parmenides—a historical impossibility might represent figuratively intellectual rather direct conversation
book intriguing philosophers poorly received among classicists reviewer calling havelock's argument basic difference plato pre-socratics failure analysis plato aristotle distortion
preface plato seventeenth-century illustration plato's allegory cave
liberal temper makes argument division plato early greek philosophy without fully realised account havelock's theory greek literacy still developing throughout period
rather attempting once again explain distinction 5 th- 4 th-century bc thought terms dissection earlier school havelock turned 1963 preface plato 4 th-century bc philosophy itself
interested principally plato's much debated rejection poetry republic fictionalised socrates argues poetic mimesis—the representation life art—is bad soul
havelock's claim republic used understand position poetry history greek mind
book divided two parts first exploration oral culture havelock thinks oral thought second argument havelock calls necessity platonism title part 2 intimate relationship platonic thought development literacy
instead concentrating philosophical definitions key terms book democritus havelock turned greek language itself arguing meaning words changed after full development written literature admit self-reflective subject even pronouns different functions
result universal shift greek mind imagine confront here change greek language syntax linguistic usage overtones certain key words part larger intellectual revolution affected whole range greek cultural experience
our present business connect discovery crisis greek culture saw replacement orally memorised tradition quite different system instruction education therefore saw homeric state mind give way platonic
havelock plato's rejection poetry merely realisation cultural shift participant
two distinct phenomena covered shift observed greek culture end 5 th century content thought particular concept man soul organisation thought
homer havelock argues order ideas associative temporal
epic's units meaning
linked associatively form episode parts episode greater whole
plato other hand purpose thought arrive significance whole move specific general
havelock points out plato's syntax shares other 4 th-century writers reflects organisation making smaller ideas subordinate bigger ideas
thus platonic theory forms itself havelock claims derives shift organisation greek language ultimately comes down different function conception noun
preface plato profound impact almost immediately after publication impact complex inconsistent
book's claims refer ideas number different fields study then fairly new oral literature well greek philosophy greek philology book also acknowledges influence literary theory particularly structuralism
1960 s period those fields growing further apart reaction preface each them starkly different
among classicists response ranged indifference derision majority simply questioning details havelock's history literacy pointing both earlier instances writing havelock thinks possible later instances oral influence
philosophy particularly platonic scholarship moving different direction time havelock neither engages nor cited principal movers field
however book embraced literary theorists students transition literacy others fields diverse psychology anthropology
ultimately book's utility textual scholarship limited havelock's methods
account orality based almost entirely homer history homeric text known forces havelock make claims based assumptions cannot fully tested
later classicists argue poetic nature homer's language works against very arguments havelock makes intellectual nature oral poetry
asserts definitive use language never conclusively demonstrated accident metrical convenience
homerists like platonists found book less useful precise work their own discipline many classicists rejected outright havelock's essential thesis oral culture predominated through 5 th century
same time though havelock's influence particularly literary theory growing enormously

latter part career havelock's relentless pursuit unvarying thesis led lack interest addressing opposing viewpoints
review havelock's greek concept justice book attempts ascribe most significant ideas greek philosophy linguistic research philosopher alasdair mac intyre accuses havelock brusque refusal recognize substance case defeat
result refusal havelock seems caught conflict mere contradiction opponents without attempt refutation simply asserts repeatedly philosophy fundamentally literate nature countered reminder mac intyre says socrates no books
last public lecture published posthumously havelock addressed political implications own scholarly work
delivered harvard 16 march 1988 less three weeks before death lecture framed principally opposition university chicago philosopher leo strauss
strauss published detailed extensive critique havelock's liberal temper greek politics march 1959 liberalism classical political philosophy journal review metaphysics
strauss died 14 years later 1973 same year havelock retired
havelock's 1988 lecture claims contain systematic account plato's politics havelock argues plato's idealism applies mathematical strictness politics countering old teacher cornford's assertion platonic arguments morality must analyzable arithmetical terms cannot serious
way thinking politics havelock concluded used model understanding shaping inherently nonmathematical interactions stuff human politics conflict compromise
