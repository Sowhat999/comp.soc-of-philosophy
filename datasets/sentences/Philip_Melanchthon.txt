remarkable luther vehemently attacked men like erasmus bucer thought truth stake never spoke directly against melanchthon even during melancholy last years conquered temper
strained relation these two men never came external things such human rank fame much less other advantages matters church doctrine chiefly fundamental difference their individualities repelled attracted each other because nature formed out them man

universal priesthood melanchthon luther no principle ecclesiastical constitution purely religious principle
accordance idea melanchthon tried keep traditional church constitution government including bishops
want however church altogether independent state rather agreement luther believed duty secular authorities protect religion church

father christian humanism exerted lasting influence upon scientific life germany
[but erasmus called prince humanists
works new original clear intelligible answered their purpose
style natural plain better however latin greek german
without natural eloquence although voice weak
melanchthon numerous treatises dealing education learning present key thoughts learning including views basis method goal reformed education

kept practical cared little connection parts loci form isolated paragraphs
fundamental difference luther melanchthon lies much latter's ethical conception humanistic mode thought formed basis theology made ready acknowledge moral religious truths outside christianity also bring christian truth closer contact them thus mediate christian revelation ancient philosophy
melanchthon's views differed luther's modifications ideas
melanchthon looked upon law correlate gospel effect salvation prepared unchangeable order spiritual world basis god himself
furthermore reduced luther's much richer view redemption legal satisfaction

moral philosophy true does know anything promise grace revealed gospel development natural law implanted god heart man therefore representing part divine law
revealed law necessitated because sin distinguished natural law greater completeness clearness
fundamental order moral life grasped also reason therefore development moral philosophy natural principles must neglected
melanchthon therefore made no sharp distinction natural revealed morals
contribution christian ethics proper sense must sought augsburg confession apology well loci followed luther depicting evangelical ideal life free realization divine law personality blessed faith filled spirit god
