sukarno developed personality cult capital newly acquired west irian renamed sukarnapura highest peak country renamed carstensz pyramid puntjak sukarno sukarno peak
despite these appearances unchallenged control sukarno's guided democracy stood fragile grounds due inherent conflict two underlying support pillars military communists
military nationalists islamic groups shocked rapid growth communist party under sukarno's protection
feared imminent establishment communist state indonesia
1965 pki 3 million members particularly strong central java bali
pki become strongest party indonesia

advocated indonesians standing their own feet berdikari reach economic self-sufficiency free foreign influence
towards end rule sukarno's lack interest economics created distance himself indonesian people suffering economically
face become bloated disease flamboyance sexual conquests once endeared people caused public criticism turned support towards army
