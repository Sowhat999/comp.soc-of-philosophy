philosophy worldview grandson unitarian minister arthur buckminster fuller r
buckminster fuller also unitarian
buckminster fuller early environmental activist
very aware finite resources planet offer promoted principle termed ephemeralization essence—according futurist fuller disciple stewart brand—fuller coined mean doing less
resources waste material cruder products recycled making valuable products increasing efficiency entire process
fuller also introduced synergetics encompassing term used broadly metaphoric language communicating experiences using geometric concepts specifically reference empirical study systems transformation emphasis total system behavior unpredicted behavior any isolated components
fuller coined term long before term synergy became popular
fuller pioneer thinking globally explored principles energy material efficiency fields architecture engineering design
cited françois de chardenedes' opinion petroleum standpoint replacement cost out our current energy budget essentially net incoming solar flux cost nature over million dollars per u
gallon us$300000 per litre produce
point view use transportation fuel people commuting work represents huge net loss compared their earnings
encapsulation quotation views might there no energy crisis crisis ignorance
fuller concerned sustainability human survival under existing socio-economic system yet remained optimistic humanity's future
defining wealth terms knowledge technological ability protect nurture support accommodate growth needs life analysis condition spaceship earth caused conclude certain time during 1970 s humanity attained unprecedented state
convinced accumulation relevant knowledge combined quantities major recyclable resources already extracted earth attained critical level such competition necessities necessary anymore
cooperation become optimum survival strategy
selfishness declared unnecessary hence-forth unrationalizable
war obsolete
criticized previous utopian schemes too exclusive thought major source their failure
work thought utopia needed include everyone

dymaxion automobile per se rather 'ground-taxying mode' vehicle might day designed fly land drive — omni-medium transport air land water
fuller focused landing taxiing qualities noted severe limitations handling
team made constant improvements refinements platform fuller noted dymaxion invention made available general public without considerable improvements
bodywork aerodynamically designed increased fuel efficiency speed well light weight platform featured lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis rear-mounted v8 engine front-drive three-wheels
vehicle steered via third wheel rear capable 90° steering lock
thus able steer tight circle dymaxion often caused sensation bringing nearby traffic halt
shortly after launch prototype crashed after being hit another car killing dymaxion's driver
other car driven local politician illegally removed accident scene leaving reporters arrived subsequently blame dymaxion's unconventional design — though investigations exonerated prototype
fuller himself later crash another prototype young daughter aboard
despite courting interest important figures auto industry fuller used family inheritance finish second third prototypes — eventually selling three dissolving dymaxion corporation maintaining dymaxion never intended commercial venture

1969 fuller began otisco project named after location otisco new york
project developed demonstrated concrete spray technology used conjunction mesh covered wireforms viable means producing large scale load bearing spanning structures built site without use pouring molds other adjacent surfaces hoisting
initial construction method used circular concrete footing anchor posts set
tubes cut length ends flattened then bolted together form duodeca-rhombicahedron 22-sided hemisphere geodesic structure spans ranging 60 feet 18 m
form then draped layers ¼-inch wire mesh attached twist ties
concrete then sprayed onto structure building up solid layer cured support additional concrete added variety traditional means
fuller referred these buildings monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes
tubular frame form proved too problematic came setting windows doors abandoned
second method used iron rebar set vertically concrete footing then bent inward welded place create dome's wireform structure performed satisfactorily
domes up three stories tall built method proved remarkably strong
other shapes such cones pyramids arches proved equally adaptable
project enabled grant underwritten syracuse university sponsored us steel rebar johnson wire corp mesh portland cement company concrete
ability build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures free space open many possibilities architecture considered fuller's greatest contributions
