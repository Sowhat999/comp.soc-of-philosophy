work themes early text paintings 1966 baldessari using photographs text simply text canvas
early major works canvas paintings empty painted statements derived contemporary art theory
early attempt baldessari's included hand-painted phrase suppose true after all? then? 1967 heavily worked painted surface
however proved personally disappointing because form method conflicted objective use language preferred employ
baldessari decided solution remove own hand construction image employ commercial lifeless style text impact viewer without distractions
words then physically lettered sign painters unornamented black font
first series presented ironic statement two-dimensional surface without any articulation dead experience 1967
another work painting kubler 1967–68 presented viewer theoretical instructions how view importance context continuity previous works
work referenced art historian george kubler's seminal book shape time remarks history things
seemingly legitimate art concerns intended baldessari become hollow ridiculous presented such purely self-referential manner
disowning early work 1970 baldessari five friends burnt paintings created 1953 1966 part new piece titled cremation project
ashes these paintings baked cookies placed urn resulting art installation consists bronze commemorative plaque destroyed paintings' birth death dates well recipe making cookies
through ritual cremation baldessari draws connection artistic practice human life cycle
thus act disavowal becomes generative work auto-destructive artist jean tinguely
juxtaposing text images baldessari best known works blend photographic materials such film stills take them out their original context rearrange their form often including addition words sentences
related early text paintings wrong series 1966-1968 paired photographic images lines text amateur photography book aiming violation set basic rules snapshot composition
works baldessari himself photographed front palm precisely appear tree growing out head
photographic california map project 1969 created physical forms resembled letters california geographically near very spots map printed
binary code series baldessari used images information holders alternating photographs stand on-off state binary code example alternated photos woman holding cigarette parallel her mouth then dropping away
another baldessari's series juxtaposed image object such glass block wood phrase glass glass wood wood combined cigar good smoke image artist smoking cigar
these directly refer rené magritte's treachery images images similarly used stand objects described
however series also apparently refers sigmund freud's famous attributed observation sometimes cigar just cigar well rudyard kipling's … woman woman good cigar smoke
double bill series large inkjet prints baldessari paired work two selected artists such giovanni di paolo david hockney fernand léger max ernst single canvas further altering appropriated picture plane overlaying own hand-painted color additions
baldessari then names two artistic “collaborators” each canvas’s lower edge such …and manet …and duchamp
arbitrary games baldessari expressed interest language comes similarities structure games both operate arbitrary mandatory system rules
spirit many works sequences showing attempts accomplishing arbitrary goal such throwing three balls air get straight line 1973 artist attempted just photographing results eventually selecting best out 36 tries 36 being determining number just because standard number shots roll 35 mm film
writer eldritch priest ties john baldessari's piece throwing four balls air get square best 36 tries early example post-conceptual art
work published 1973 young italian publisher giampaolo prearo first believe invest work baldessari
printed two series 2000 copies second precious reserved publisher 500 copies
following baldessari’s seminal statement “i will make any boring art” conceived work artist hitting various objects golf club 1972–73 composed 30 photographs artist swinging hitting golf club objects excavated dump parody cataloging rather thorough straight classification
pointing much baldessari's work involves pointing tells viewer look how make selections comparisons often simply sake doing
baldessari's commissioned paintings 1969 series took idea pointing literally after read criticism conceptual art claimed nothing pointing
beginning photos hand pointing various objects baldessari then hired amateur yet technically adept artists paint pictures
then added caption painting [painter's name] each finished painting
instance likened choreographer directing action while having no direct hand these paintings typically read questioning idea artistic authorship
amateur artists analogized sign painters series chosen their pedestrian methods indifferent being painted
baldessari critiques formalist assessments art segment video how art now 1973 entitled examining three nails gives obsessive attention minute details nails such how much rust descriptive qualities such appears cooler distant less important others
