rather human history full examples gifts giving rise reciprocal exchange
famous question drove inquiry anthropology gift power resides object given causes recipient pay back? 19903
answer simple gift total prestation see law obligations imbued spiritual mechanisms engaging honour both giver receiver term total prestation total social fact fait social total coined student maurice leenhardt after durkheim's social fact
such transactions transcend divisions spiritual material way according mauss almost magical
giver does merely give object also part himself object indissolubly tied giver objects never completely separated men exchange them 199031
because bond giver gift act giving creates social bond obligation reciprocate part recipient
reciprocate means lose honour status spiritual implications even worse polynesia failure reciprocate means lose mana one's spiritual source authority wealth
mauss distinguished three obligations giving necessary initial step creation maintenance social relationships receiving refuse receive reject social bond reciprocating order demonstrate one's own liberality honour wealth
important notion mauss' conceptualisation gift exchange gregory 1982 1997 refers inalienability
commodity economy there strong distinction objects persons through notion private property
objects sold meaning ownership rights fully transferred new owner
object thereby become alienated original owner
gift economy however objects given inalienated givers loaned rather sold ceded
fact identity giver invariably bound up object given causes gift power compels recipient reciprocate
because gifts inalienable must returned act giving creates gift-debt repaid
because notion expected return gift creates relationship over time two individuals
other words through gift-giving social bond evolves assumed continue through space time until future moment exchange
gift exchange therefore leads mutual interdependence giver receiver
according mauss free gift returned contradiction because cannot create social ties
following durkheimian quest understanding social cohesion through concept solidarity mauss's argument solidarity achieved through social bonds created gift exchange
mauss emphasizes exchanging resulted will attaching other people ‘to put people under obligations’ because “in theory such gifts voluntary fact given repaid under obligation”

large western city
donor receiver know each other unlikely ever meet again
context donation certainly creates no obligation side beggar reciprocate neither donor nor beggar such expectation
testart argues latter actually enforced
feels mauss overstated magnitude obligation created social pressures particularly description potlatch amongst north american indians
another example non-reciprocal free gift provided british anthropologist james laidlaw 2000
describes social context indian jain renouncers group itinerant celibate renouncers living ascetic life spiritual purification salvation
jainist interpretation doctrine ahimsa extremely rigorous application principles nonviolence influences diet jain renouncers compels them avoid preparing food potentially involve violence against microscopic organisms
since jain renouncers work rely food donations lay families within jain community
however former must appear having any wants desires very hesitantly apologetically receive food prepared latter
free gifts therefore challenge aspects maussian notion gift unless moral non-material qualities gifting considered
these aspects course heart gift demonstrated books such annette weiner's 1992 inalienable possessions paradox keeping while giving
however mauss offers possible response such criticisms section note alms
