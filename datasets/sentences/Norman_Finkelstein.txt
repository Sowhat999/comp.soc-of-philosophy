holocaust industry main article holocaust industry holocaust industry reflections exploitation jewish suffering published 2000
here finkelstein argues elie wiesel others exploit memory holocaust ideological weapon
purpose writes finkelstein enable state israel world's most formidable military powers horrendous human rights record [to] cast itself victim state provide israel immunity criticism
alleges calls double shakedown repellent gang plutocrats hoodlums hucksters seeking enormous legal damages financial settlements germany switzerland moneys then go lawyers institutional actors involved procuring them rather actual holocaust survivors
book received hostile reception quarters critics charging poorly researched and/or allowed others exploit antisemitic purposes
example german historian hans mommsen disparaged first edition most trivial book appeals easily aroused anti-semitic prejudices
israeli holocaust historian israel gutman called book lampoon stating research isn't even political literature
don't even think should reviewed critiqued legitimate book
[citation needed] book also harshly criticized brown university professor omer bartov university chicago professor peter novick
based criticism holocaust exploitation anti-defamation league others branded finkelstein holocaust denier despite being son two holocaust survivors most whose family died holocaust
however preeminent holocaust scholar raul hilberg book expressed views hilberg himself subscribed substance too found exploitation holocaust finkelstein describes detestable
asked another occasion finkelstein's analysis might play hands neo-nazis antisemitic purposes hilberg replied well even use fashion i'm afraid comes truth openly without regard any consequences undesirable embarrassing
other critics claim finkelstein's evidence highly selective and/or dubious arguments based misinterpretation history questionable use sources
instance finkelstein absolves swiss banks serious misconduct towards holocaust survivors depicts them victims jewish terror based sentence important report annex while reportedly ignored report body describes deceitful actions swiss banks inappropriate closing accounts failure keep adequate records etc
criticism alan dershowitz's case israel main article dershowitz–finkelstein affair finkelstein's public feud jurist academic alan dershowitz lasted years negative effect finkelstein's academic career shortly after publication book case israel alan dershowitz finkelstein derided collection fraud falsification plagiarism nonsense
during debate democracy now! finkelstein asserted dershowitz lacked knowledge specific contents own book
also claimed dershowitz write book may even read
finkelstein noted 20 instances many pages dershowitz's book cites same sources passages used joan peters her book largely same sequence ellipses same places
two instances dershowitz reproduces peters's errors see below
finkelstein concluded dershowitz checked original sources himself contrary latter's claims
finkelstein suggests copying quotations amounts copying ideas
examining copy proof dershowitz's book managed obtain found evidence dershowitz secretarial assistant holly beth billington check harvard library sources read peters's book
dershowitz answered charge letter university california's press director lynne withey arguing finkelstein made up smoking gun quotation changed wording 'cite' 'copy' book
public debate stated somebody borrowed quote without going check back whether mark twain obviously serious charge however insisted emphatically himself indeed checked original source twain
dershowitz threatened libel action over charges finkelstein's book consequence publisher deleted word plagiarism text before publication
finkelstein agreed remove suggestion dershowitz true author case israel because publisher couldn't document
asserting consult original sources dershowitz finkelstein simply accusing good scholarly practice citing references learned initially peters's book
dershowitz denies used any peters's ideas without citation
plagiarism taking someone else's words claiming they're your own
there no borrowed words anybody
there no borrowed ideas anybody because fundamentally disagree conclusions peters's book
footnote case israel cites peters's book dershowitz explicitly denies relies peters conclusions data
their joint interview democracy now however finkelstein cited specific passages dershowitz's book phrase says peters coined incorrectly attributed george orwell [peters] coins phrase 'turnspeak' she says she's using play off george orwell listeners know used phrase 'newspeak
she coined her own phrase 'turnspeak'
you go mr
dershowitz's book got confused massive borrowings joan peters two occasions i'll cite them those copy book page 57 page 153 uses phrase quote george orwell's 'turnspeak'
'turnspeak' orwell mr
dershowitz you're felix frankfurter chair harvard you must know orwell never use such clunky phrase 'turnspeak'
james o
freedman former president dartmouth college university iowa american academy arts sciences defended dershowitz understand [finkelstein's] charge plagiarism against alan dershowitz
there no claim dershowitz used words others without attribution
uses words others quotes them properly generally cites them original sources mark twain palestine royal commission etc
[finkelstein's] complaint instead should cited them secondary source dershowitz may come upon them
chicago manual style emphasizes 'importance attribution
reuse others' materials important identify original source
bolsters claims fair use also helps avoid any accusation plagiarism
precisely dershowitz
responding article nation alexander cockburn dershowitz also cited chicago manual style cockburn's claim quotes should cited their original sources rather secondary source believes stumbled upon them
even correct found these quotations peters's book preferred method citation original source chicago manual style emphasizes reuse others' materials important identify original source
helps avoid any accusation plagiarism
cite source secondary source 'quoted
generally discouraged
cockburn responded quoting chicago manual style dershowitz artfully implies followed rules citing original opposed secondary source peters
misrepresents chicago here original means merely origin borrowed material instance peters
now look second bit quote chicago chastely separated preceding sentence demure three-point ellipsis
my associate kate levin discovered passage cite source secondary source
occurs page 727 no less 590 pages later material before ellipsis section titled citations taken secondary sources
here's full quote dershowitz left out set bold 'quoted in'
cite source secondary source quoted generally discouraged since authors expected examined works cite
original source unavailable however both original secondary source must listed
chicago clearly insisting unless dershowitz went originals obliged cite peters
finkelstein conclusively demonstrated didn't go originals
plagiarism qed plus added time willful distortion language chicago's guidelines cobbling together two separate discussions

three opposing faculty members subsequently filed minority report opposing tenure supported dean college chuck suchar
suchar stated opposed tenure because finkelstein's personal reputation demeaning attacks dershowitz benny morris holocaust authors elie wiesel jerzy kosinski inconsistent de paul's vincentian values examples latter suchar argued finkelstein lacked respect dignity individual rights others hold express different intellectual positions

[citation needed] criticism criticism leveled against finkelstein several angles
first sources responses those whose work finkelstein discussed
daniel goldhagen whose book hitler's willing executioners finkelstein criticized claimed scholarship everything burning political agenda
alan dershowitz written peter novick professor history university chicago noted holocaust historian whose work finkelstein says inspired holocaust industry strongly criticized latter's work describing trash
similarly dershowitz whose book case israel finkelstein's response beyond chutzpah sparked ongoing feud two claimed finkelstein's complicity conspiracy against pro-israel scholars mode attack consistent
chomsky selects target directs finkelstein probe writings minute detail conclude writer didn't actually write work plagiarized hoax fraud arguing finkelstein leveled charges against many academics calling least 10 distinguished jews 'hucksters' 'hoaxters' sic 'thieves' 'extortionists' worse
although back forth finkelstein dershowitz received most attention attracted significant controversy finkelstein maintained real issue israel's human rights record
israeli historian omer bartov writing new york times book review judged holocaust industry marred same errors denounces those exploit holocaust profit politics filled precisely kind shrill hyperbole finkelstein rightly deplores much current media hype over holocaust brimming same indifference historical facts inner contradictions strident politics dubious contextualizations oozes same smug sense moral intellectual superiority
like any conspiracy theory contains several grains truth like any such theory both irrational insidious
finkelstein accused journalist jeffrey goldberg torturing being accessory torture palestinian prisoners during idf service first intifada based statements made goldberg's book prisoners
finkelstein says goldberg admits personally sending prisoners zinzana says repeatedly condemned torture human rights reports

telephone interview today's zaman 2009 finkelstein stated think israel number commentators pointed out becoming insane state
while rest world wants peace europe wants peace us wants peace state wants war war war
first week massacres there reports israeli press israel want put ground forces gaza because preparing attacks iran
then there reports planning attacks lebanon
lunatic state
asked how son holocaust survivors felt israel’s operation gaza finkelstein replied long time since felt any emotional connection state israel relentlessly brutally inhumanly keeps these vicious murderous wars
vandal state
there russian writer once described vandal states genghis khan telegraph
israel genghis khan computer
feel no emotion affinity state
good friends their families there course want any them hurt
sometimes feel israel come out boils sic hell satanic state
anti-defamation league described finkelstein obsessive anti-zionist filled vitriolic hatred zionism israel
being called anti-zionist finkelstein it's superficial term
am opposed any state ethnic character israel
finkelstein advocate two-state solution israeli-palestinian conflict
hezbollah hamas 2006 carlos latuff cartoon depicting finkelstein's comparisons state israel armed arab groups finkelstein expressed solidarity hezbollah hamas respect defensive actions alleging israel invaded lebanon signal rejection hamas seeking diplomatic settlement israel
also condemned israel's refusal abide international law [and] abide opinion international community settle conflict
course happy meet hizbullah people because point view rarely heard united states
no problem saying want express solidarity them am going coward sic hypocrite
don't care hizbullah political organization
don't know much their politics anyhow it's irrelevant
don't live lebanon
it's choice lebanese make want their leaders want represent them
there fundamental principle
people right defend their country foreign occupiers people right defend their country invaders destroying their country
me very basic elementary uncomplicated question
while condemning targeting civilians achieve political goal finkelstein stated believes hezbollah right target israeli civilians long israel persists targeting [lebanese] civilians until israel ceases terrorist acts
finkelstein claims equivalence exists hamas state israel regards military policy targeted killings during second intifada
according finkelstein record shows israel routinely targeted civilians killing israel indiscriminately kills civilians
concludes argument among human rights organizations any rate
effect there’s no difference indiscriminately killing civilians targeting civilians
finkelstein argued israel's primary motivations launching 2008 offensive gaza hamas signaling wanted diplomatic settlement conflict along june 1967 border
finkelstein believes hamas joined international community seeking diplomatic settlement describes hamas's stance towards israel prior war peace offensive
statements bds movement see also boycott divestment sanctions finkelstein made many criticisms boycott divestment sanctions movement
finkelstein stated think solidarity movement right tactics
support bds
will never reach broad public until unless explicit their goal
their goal include recognition israel otherwise it's nonstarter
elsewhere stated supports lowercase bds making same point tactics goals
february jewish chronicle england stated finkelstein launched blistering attack bds movement saying hypocritical dishonest cult [l]ike munchkin cult oz tries cleverly pose human rights activists while reality their goal destroy israel
finkelstein stated bds movement very few successes just like cult leaders pretend hugely successful reality general public rejects their extreme views
june appearance democracy now! finkelstein elaborated criticisms bds movement problem see bds movement tactic
support boycott divestment sanctions? course you should
most human rights organizations church organizations moved direction
problem goal
official bds movement claim agnostic neutral—whatever term you want use—on question israel
you can’t reach broad public you agnostic question israel
broad public wants know you stand? you claim stand you lose them
bds movement says i’m using their language rights-based organization
based international law
that’s you go rights-based international law
international law clear
you read last sentence 2004 international court justice opinion wall israel building west bank last sentence says look forward two states palestinian state alongside israel peace neighbors
that's law
you want go past law ignore israel part you’ll never reach broad public
then it's cult
then it’s pointless my opinion
we're wasting time
it's wasting time
becomes — know it's strong word hope won't faulted becomes historically criminal because there time whatever made no difference
nobody listening
you shout whatever you want — cares? now actually reach people
there possibility
i’m saying certainty
i'm even saying probability
there possibility reach broad public
very careful words use very careful political strategy map out
otherwise we're going squander real opportunity
don't want squander
