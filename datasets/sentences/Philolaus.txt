fragments 6 13 identified coming book nature ancient sources
stobaeus cites fragments 2 4–7 coming work cosmos appears alternate title nature probably arose because chapter heading stobaeus under fragments cited ‘on cosmos
’ cosmology further information pythagorean astronomical system book philolaus begins nature physis world-order cosmos fitted together out things unlimited out things limiting both world-order whole everything
robert scoon explained philolaus universe 1922 philolaus trying show how ordered universe know came present condition
arose says action harmony basic substance know must infer
substance consisted different primary elements harmony fitted these together such way nature φύση turns out ordered world κόσμος
stobaeus account philolaus away ideas fixed direction space developed first non-geocentric views universe
new way thinking quite literally revolved around hypothetical astronomical object called central fire
philolaus says there fire middle centre
again fire highest point surrounding everything
nature middle first around dance ten divine bodies — sky planets then sun next moon next earth next counterearth after them fire hearth holds position centre
highest part surrounding elements found their purity calls olympus regions beneath orbit olympus five planets sun moon calls world part under them being beneath moon around earth found generation change calls sky
— stobaeus
philolaus's system sphere fixed stars five planets sun moon earth moved round central fire
according aristotle writing metaphysics philolaus added tenth unseen body called counter-earth without there nine revolving bodies pythagorean number theory required tenth
however according greek scholar george burch aristotle lampooning philolaus's ideas
reality philolaus' ideas predated idea spheres hundreds years
nearly two-thousand years later nicolaus copernicus mention de revolutionibus philolaus already knew earth's revolution around central fire
however pointed out stobaeus betrays tendency confound dogmas early ionian philosophers occasionally mixes up platonism pythagoreanism
philosophy see also pythagoreanism § music harmony philolaus argued foundation everything part played ideas limit unlimited
first declarations work philolaus things universe result combination unlimited limiting things unlimited nothing object knowledge
limiters unlimiteds combined together harmony harmonia state affairs nature harmony
essence things eternal unique divine nature knowledge does belong man
still possible any things known us should arrive our knowledge essence internal foundation principles world founded limiting unlimited elements
now since these principles mutually similar neither similar nature impossible order world should formed them unless harmony intervened
