professional soldier major accomplishment established study military sub-field sociology creating fertile research agenda other scholars still follow
remains foundational works area civil-military relations particularly important given previous foci sociology avoided study armed forces
professional soldier focused military elites well those officers destined soon join inner-circles military decision-making177

revealed changing nature organizational authority within military away disciplinary model towards subtler forms personnel management reflecting convergence military civilian spheres
furthermore soldier become technical proficient functional means narrowing gap civilian military spheres requiring specialized civilian participation technical capacities military
military also seemed experiencing shift recruitment trends wherein demographics military after world war ii began closely resemble those american people
finally leadership u
armed forces become increasingly politicized
led janowitz develop dichotomous epistemic framework consisting two competing perspectives proper use armed forces international relations
these perspectives termed absolutist pragmatic 996

after janowitz completed chairmanship sociology department university chicago 1972 able place energy academic pursuits

military arguing against increased militarization american culture
morris janowitz professional soldier1960 samuel huntington soldier state1956 formulated two distinct closely related theories provided alternative conceptions those emphasized fears militarization
both theories concerned preservation liberal democracy huntington advocated liberal theory objective civilian control military protect american democracy foreign threats while janowitz advocated civic-republican theory encouraged active interconnectedness civil society military order foster greater sense civic participation
these theories informed basic historical perspectives proper construction civil-military relations democratic societies
huntington's liberal theory civil-military relations seemed flow thinkers like thomas hobbes advocated role military protect society threats emerging state nature present international relations unbound social contract john stuart mill argued strenuously military must regulated controlled state may pursue own objectives counter democratic society
[citation needed] janowitz's theory civil-military relations other hand seemed recall ancient roman republic embraced external conflict motivating cohering force domestic culture encouraged civic participation sense citizenship necessary maintenance nation
theory also centrally concerned civic virtue inspired through role active participation citizen soldier
james burk noted both theories somewhat outdated flawed today's standards
burk's words huntington's theory presumes there clearly delineated military sphere defined war fighting independent social political sphere 13
huntington's theory overlooked transformation international relations occurring result development nuclear weapons arms race threat nuclear annihilation overestimated ability nations define achieve acceptable ends under such war fighting context
other problem huntington's theory advocated conservative realism international relations requiring spartan cultural attitude unacceptable american people
other hand janowitz argued civic participation should encouraged american society through model citizen-soldier failed elucidate how such model propagated absence mass-mobilization major wars
such method embedding military service within voluntary national service system idea never found political support american politics 13-14
pragmatism janowitz earned bachelor's degree economics washington square college new york university new york university studied under sidney hook prominent pragmatist former student john dewey
hook exposed janowitz dewey's philosophy american pragmatism early age though fully explore pragmatism's philosophical foundations sociology until after founding heritage sociology series university chicago21
sociology weakly tied pragmatism chicago school through george herbert mead theory symbolic interaction emphasized micro-social research agenda25
janowitz however admirer john dewey identified broader meta-theoretical framework sociological inquiry rejected grand idealist theories ultimate truth reality focusing instead social relations contexts [that] overlapping interpenetrating leading empirically dynamic social organization never partially integrated relatively autonomous
society characteristically unsettled affair creating problems social control
sociological inquiry like pragmatic inquiries thus part larger community discourse 25
janowitz also emphasized systemic analysis attributed harold laswell relies overlapping hypotheses differentiated concrete objects analysis embedded larger social setting26
taken together pragmatism effected janowitz outlook such way overall effect linking data theory generating research agenda focusing experimental methods empirical research28
janowitz also utilized pragmatism characterization attitudes among military leadership
professional soldier janowitz noted during vietnam era prolonged debate officer corp legitimacy strategic objectives specific military tactics unfolded under two dominant perspectives appropriate role military international relations absolutist pragmatist
absolutists military officers thought terms conventional definitions victory while pragmatists those thought terms changing realities nuclear weapons national liberation movementsxli
janowitz traced these attitudes historically competing perspectives european east asian theaters war during wwii noting strong continuity officer's estimate conduct world war ii contemporary adherence pragmatic absolute doctrine290
those defined european theater war measured success likely adhere pragmatic doctrine while those viewed european theater failure tended absolutist
moreover absolutist perspective associated emphasis preference naval strategy emanating alfred thayer mahan's theories naval power strategy based air power both better suited conflict east asia rather europe 290
cold war period adherents both perspectives adapted new realities nuclear warfare through shared belief nuclear deterrence diverged competing sub-doctrines massive graduated deterrence 304
thus absolutists tended side gen
macarthur's proposal commence strategic nuclear bombing china during korean war order achieve absolute military victory while pragmatists likely support limited wars suitable achieving political objectives311
