fragile leaves sibyl dante's master plan 1962 seung’s first book fragile leaves sibyl dante’s master plan highly original reading dante’s divine comedy crucial understanding seung’s development philosopher
articulates illustrates method interpretation trilogy hermeneutics cultural thematics formation faustian ethos 1976 structuralism hermeneutics 1982 semiotics thematic hermeneutics 1982
these three volumes contain seung’s contribution literary philosophical hermeneutics constitute methodological groundwork study kant plato nietzsche spinoza goethe wagner normative political theory
fragile leaves sibyl grew out term paper seung during first year graduate studies yale university
subject most central issue dante studies thematic unity commedia many dante scholars still regard either unsolved unsolvable
centuries dante readers pondered relation dante’s construction three realms afterworld hell purgatory paradise dante’s journey through those three realms
easy say dante’s main concern describe journey through afterworld unfold vision universal order? least obviously journey order two interdependent themes dante’s poem
account journey presupposes cosmic order order understood through account cosmic journey
fragile leaves seung says know commedia three parts inferno purgatorio paradiso know how these three parts constitute poem
learn three parts describe three worlds see how three worlds unified cosmos
find many themes scenes dante’s narrative understand how those themes scenes woven central plot dante’s text
article “the metaphysics commedia” published twenty five years after fragile leaves sibyl seung restates approach commedia problem unity division dante’s vision “what principle unity holds together nine circles hell seven terraces purgatory ten spheres paradise” “what principle divides hell nine circles purgatory seven circles paradise ten spheres?” seung elucidates poem’s thematic unity using three principles essential medieval christian thinking
first principle medieval classification virtues sins
provides framework understanding formal structures three realms
seung shows hell purgatory paradise structured accordance medieval table seven natural virtues three supernatural virtues implicitly celebrated ten spheres paradiso
natural virtues humility mercy meekness fortitude liberality temperance chastity supernatural virtues three theological virtues faith hope love
contraries natural virtues seven deadly sins pride envy wrath sloth avarice gluttony lust condemned sinful acts various sections inferno seven terraces purgatorio appear vicious dispositions being purged their virtuous opposites
moreover beginning inferno supernatural virtues thematized being absent beginning purgatorio appear distorted near end purgatorio celebrated regained finally last cantos paradiso presented full display
seung then shows dante's first principle construction classification virtues sins based second principle tripartite theory human soul vegetative sensitive spiritual their powers concupiscible irascible intellectual
natural supernatural virtues their contraries reflect powers tripartite soul virtuous vicious dispositions virtuous sinful acts
dante's third final principle construction holy trinity
since human soul created image god seung holds triadic structure human soul resembles trinitarian structure divine nature father son holy spirit
establishing systematic connection three parts human soul three persons holy trinity seung demonstrates everything dante witnesses epic journey meant allegorical reflection holy trinity their activities
because dante scholars failed recognize systematic allegorical function dante's epic seung maintains reduced grand human comedy mass humanity dante encounters journey hardly leave any room presence god
trinitarian reading seung securely installs holy trinity epic hero dante poem
apart interpretation seung says poem epic without epic hero
many dante scholars tried cope poetic anomaly exalting dante traveler epic heror
traveling reporter cannot take single step journey without aid three guides
never shows heroic stature any numerous actions
seung's trinitarian reading best exemplified allegorical interpretation dante’s three guides
traditionally dante studies focused two guides virgil leads dante through hell purgatory beatrice appears terrestrial paradise near end purgatorio she replaces virgil becomes dante’s guide through spheres paradiso
former commonly interpreted representing reason latter representing faith
however seung points out traditional account committed inexcusable mistake completely ignoring dante's third final guide saint bernard clairvaux appears end dante's ascent highest heaven
through saint bernard’s prayer virgin mary dante granted beatific vision holy trinity
final guide consummates dante's long journey initiated sustained first second guides
therefore role former far important roles latter
most important guide accommodated within traditional dante studies because operated dyadic thomistic schema natural supernatural orders
virgil beatrice represented these two orders left no room saint bernard
according seung’s trinitirian reading dante's three guides allegorically represent three persons holy trinity saint bernard dante’s ultimate third guide
virgil represents son beatrice represents holy spirit saint bernard represents father
since three persons holy trinity ultimate point reference every action dante’s narrative every component universal vision seung argues central theme commedia holy trinity governance entire universe
trinitarian reading dante's epic ultimately simple systematic
admits trinitarian meaning poem easily discovered
order discover should make systematic parallel reading poem’s three parts
focus episode segment inferno should try relate thematic content systematically corresponding episode segment purgatorio paradiso
method reading described connectionist reading stands contrast prevalent method reading dante studies commonly interpret different episodes segments parts poem self-contained entities thematic particulars cosmic theme
jesper hede university copenhagen denmark published extensive defense elaboration seung's dante interpretation comparison cogan's interpretation prevalent methods reading dante studies
cultural thematics formation faustian ethos 1976 cultural thematics seung says trinitarian reading commedia originally inspired two major movements humanities time
formalistic program new criticism preference close reading under slogan “back text” other european phenomenology motto “let object reveal itself instead imposing one’s preconception upon
though never abandoning phenomenological motto seung came serious doubts formalistic approach textual interpretation
outcome these misgivings presented trilogy cultural thematics structuralism hermeneutics semiotics thematics hermeneutics
first book seung constructively demonstrates role cultural context explication textual meaning
second book systematically examines danger misinterpretation inherent formalist post-structuralist programs textual interpretation due their disregard contextual considerations
third book takes account theoretical assumptions methodological commitments first two books presuppose presents fully elaborate theory how combine phenomenological approach textual meaning hermeneutic assertion cultural contextualism prerequisite adequate textual understanding interpretation
seung substantiates trinitarian reading commedia cultural contextualist examination intellectual development medieval thinkers writers during 12 th 13 th 14 th centuries
focuses two pairs triads development hand intellectual differences encountered works franciscan bonaventure dominican thomas aquinas franciscan duns scotus other hand literary differences displayed works three writers constitute italian trecento literature dante francesco petrarca giovanni boccaccio
seung argues these two triads though entirely corresponding time place unfold crucial premises understanding emergence modern secular ethos during late middle ages
seung speaks formation faustian ethos reference oswald spengler decline west speaks faustian man medieval invention
demarcating intellectual differences three philosophers three writers seung uses term “sensibility
term carefully chosen alternative term “idea” often used historicist studies intellectual developments changes
sensibility refers way human beings conceive their being world without necessarily formulating specific ideological system rigid pattern ideas
regard seung’s theory cultural contextualism affinity eric voegelin’s approach historical phenomena latter came regard term “idea” misconception try understand how human beings experience their being world act out their experiential conceptions their every day life well political judicial forums social institutions

semiotics thematics hermeneutics 1982 interpretive principles seung’s theory cultural thematics most clearly stated article “thematic dialectic revision hegelian dialectic” makes up last chapter book semiotics thematics hermeneutics
seung defines theory thematic dialectic since formally involves revision hegel’s dialectic often identified triadic formula thesis-antithesis-synthesis
various scholars argued hegel does explicate formula systematically apply consistently work
triad mentioned few times writings mainly polemic against logical formalism kant’s critical idealism
reason hegelian scholars sometimes maintain formula neither hegel’s invention nor constituting pattern philosophy
discussion however important understanding theory thematic dialectic
theory departs assertion hegel’s system meant systematic account how every dialectical conflict reconciled through synthesis thesis antithesis
classical example pattern thought stated hegel’s science logic
concept being concept non-being reconciled concept becoming
theory thematic dialectic attempt restate hegel’s theory nor marxian offspring form dialectical materialism
though adapting hegelian logic “both-and” combination kierkegaardian logic “either-or” well buddhist logic “neither-nor” theory breaks open narrow perimeter set hegel marx kierkegaard transforms rigidity hegelian system flexibility uniformity diversity logical necessity existential contingency
theory adapts hegel’s notion historical dialectic departs hegel’s inexhaustible idea every cultural theme dialectical opposite “for example cultural theme regarding nature object contempt defilement dialectically opposed adoring object beauty sanctity
these two cultural themes incompatible each other because contraries
them realized other must rejected
opposition these two cultural themes may called thematic exclusion contrariety
theirs dialectic incompatible incommensurate themes
type opposition resembles kantian notion antinomy
however dealing pure concepts propositions
proposition say nature adorable another proposition say nature contemptuous
thematic exclusion classical form either-or
theory thematic dialectic resourceful outlining ways problem opposition resolved
respect deviates hegel’s historicism gives systematic account interplay cultural themes does rely rigid conception synthesis
cultural themes cultural ideals
example atheist ideal rejecting existence god cultural theme theist ideal believing existence god another cultural theme
these two ideals exclude each other
cases their mutual exclusion fully sustained
seung argues thematic exclusion should distinguished thematic tension competition “for example cultural theme being concerned other world necessarily incompatible cultural theme being concerned world because does logically exclude other
possible someone concerned both worlds
these two cultural themes competition each other their competition create tension
nevertheless theirs dialectic compatible commensurate themes
dialectic cultural themes their tension conflict interaction
thematic tension resolved different ways
hegelian way synthesis “both-and” way resolve
kierkegaardian way exclusion “either-or” another way—that given two cultural ideals resolves their conflict rejecting them
third way reject both ideals buddhist approach
way “neither-nor” contrast way “either-or” turn contrasted way “both-and
however these three ways cover types resolution
according theory thematic dialectic forms thematic tension fall two principal groups each divided three main positions
hand group dualistic resolutions other hand group monistic resolutions
former dualistic accept existence two competing themes latter monistic accept existence two competing themes
dualistic group consists resolution equilibrium 2 resolution suppression 3 resolution subordination
monistic group consists 4 resolution fusion 5 resolution elimination 6 resolution absorption
add these six forms resolution form exclusion theory thematic dialectic denotes seven ways interplay dialectical opposites take place
systematic quality theory manifest example fact resolution equilibrium dualistic counterpart monistic resolution fusion resolution suppression dualistic counterpart monistic resolution elimination resolution subordination dualistic counterpart monistic resolution absorption
resolution equilibrium keep two conflicting themes balance
used achieving balance two competing interests example “the conflict private interests individuals public interests their community resolved manner
both interests regarded equally important their conflict resolved maintaining proper balance them
resolution suppression denotes theme suppresses another resolution subordination denotes theme subordinated another
explaining their difference seung takes medieval ideal contemptus mundi example “concern world totally suppressed sake concern other world
twelfth century resolution being replaced another secular concern suppressed subordinated religious concern
resolution subordination
resolution suppression acceptable long medieval christians took no strong interest natural order
once started taking positive attitude toward nature resolution became difficult maintain superseded resolution subordination
resolutions equilibrium suppression subordination well known phenomena our time
most often resolutions suppression subordination make headlines because involve uneven relationship two ideals often disturbs culturally contingent sense democracy equality western societies
however although these dualistic forms resolution prominent cover whole spectrum thematic dialectic
resolution fusion means fuse two conflicting themes
example idea supernatural order fused idea natural order making former immanent latter advocated romantic idea natural supernaturalism supernatural naturalism
resolution elimination denotes theme eliminates another
extreme scientism example type resolution
looking upon physical things strictly positivistic materialist point view scientistic position eradicates every spiritual experience reduces things physical matter
scientific materialism reductive reduces mind matter
opposite reduction also possible reduce matter mind
also resolution elimination
unlike these reductive methods resolution fusion rejects reduction
them produce monistic result
last type resolution resolution absorption denotes theme absorbs another
type resolution perhaps most difficult comprehend because easily get mistaken resolution fusion
seung’s words “although both modes produce monistic results differ important respect
resolution fusion two competing cultural themes operate equals both lose their original identities process fusion gain joint identity
resolution absorption two competing themes operate unequals retain original identity integrity while other must lose them
seung explains resolution absorption used resolving conflict individual communal interests
conflict resolved different ways
example resolved resolution equilibrium
seung points out resolution became impossible emergence sovereign individual late middle ages renaissance
“because sovereign will individual retained preserved such equilibrium
dictated subordination communal interests individual will even resolution quite perfect standpoint individual sovereignty because fully eliminate thematic tension individual communal interests
tension however resolved making absorb other
political idea people form commonwealth subject their wills will individual example individual absorption communal interests
idea absolute monarchy enlightened absolutism governed european politics 17 th 19 th century
political idea interests individuals cannot distinguished interests state example communal absorption individual interests
idea pervasive communist states 20 th century
moreover seung points out these two types absorption joined
nazism case point “the individual interests citizens absorbed interests state race turn absorbed interests führer
cults joseph stalin mao zedong other examples although might differ formal terms adolf hitler general secretary officially same status nazi leader
besides being systematic account various types resolution theory thematic dialectic also systematic theory how deal problem consequence considering interplay dialectical opposites
seung argues “the resolution thematic conflict establishes dominance cultural theme themes produce certain thematic consequences
these consequences also take various forms
outlines six forms thematic consequence continuance cultural theme maintains dominance over another cultural theme 2 expansion cultural theme expands dominance over another cultural theme 3 reaction cultural theme reacts against dominance another cultural theme 4 reversal dominance cultural theme over another reversed 5 repression cultural theme represses another cultural theme 6 deterioration cultural theme deteriorates replaced another cultural theme
these cultural events take place various historical contexts
there no simple schema causally linking these events another
seung stresses variety possibilities discussion thematic conflicts their resolutions their consequences
short account thematic dialectic highly existential contingent whereas hegel's account logical necessatarian
though critical hegel’s logical necessitarianism every dialectical conflict resolved way synthesis seung does reject assertion thematic resolutions may determined historical causes conditions operating thematic conflicts
sense historical determinism governs hegel’s historical dialectic integrated option among several others theory thematic dialectic
plato rediscovered human value social order 1996 seung’s plato book distinctive several reasons most notably substantial work ancient pre-christian philosopher
difficult discern how fits greater corpus
indeed plato rediscovered marks high point development seung’s methodological substantive interests
methodologically employs cultural thematics construct comprehensive reading philosopher central entire western tradition
seeks out most pressing questions plato’s time tries understand how plato responded them
substantively book addresses question eternal transcendent norms “platonism” versus calls “positive norms”
seung’s study plato third volume trilogy normative philosophy began 1993 intuition construction yale university press
seung’s concern there identify normative foundations john rawls’s theory justice
found two rawlses roughly correlating early later works
early rawls theory justice presented normative philosophy transcendentally true cultures
later rawls dewey lectures political liberalism backed off lofty perspective took modest position theory justice based values embedded own culture viz
liberty equality
problem latter approach rawls eventually settles wide open charges moral cultural relativism charges continued trouble rawls throughout career
[citation needed] personal reply seung's critique point rawls confided frustration finding satisfactory foundation theory justice
[citation needed] earlier transcendental perspective rawls claims drawn inspiration immanuel kant openly disdains formalistic ethics vacuity
own kantian interpretation justice fairness rawls notes kant's formalistic ethics advocates no generality universality moral principles formal requirement any moral theory
view no substantive theory justice constructed such slender basis
goes say real force [kant's] view lies elsewhere
does specify indefinite expression elsewhere
became enigma rawls scholarship
seung tries solve enigma investigating kant's entire works normative philosophy
efforts appeared two books kant’s platonic revolution moral political philosophy johns hopkins 1994 kant guide perplexed continuum 2007
according seung's investigation most grievous long-standing mistake study kant's ethics assume espoused no other moral theory formalistic ethics groundwork most important work ethics
prior groundwork according seung kant embraced platonic ideas foundation ethics inaugural dissertation 1770 reaffirmed platonic allegiance critique pure reason 1781
groundwork kant abandon platonic ethics because designed ethical formalism copernican revolution ethics
distinction new position seung labels kant's platonic ethics ethical platonism
version ethics never recognized until uncovered seung
[citation needed] further shown kant sustain ethical formalism very long after groundwork
critique practical reason kant may appear retain formalistic framework injects platonic content framework
three years later groundwork
metaphysics morals supposed crowning work ethics kant does even retain formalistic framework reverts traditional substantive ethics
divides work two parts theory justice 2 theory virtue
neither these two topics even mentioned groundwork
checkered career kant's ethical theory inaugural dissertation through first two critiques groundwork metaphysics morals
seung does trace checkered career also clearly exposes vacuity kant's ethical formalism thereby vindicating ralws's dismissal
seung concludes study kant's ethical works declaring rawls's theory justice inspired groundwork theory justice metaphysics morals
further explains theory turn inspired platonic idea justice
calls kant's platonic revolution
these works rawls kant eventually led seung plato first political philosopher west
opens preface plato book saying political philosophy great inventions plato's genius
invention took long intellectual journey seung reconstructs itinerary journey thematically connecting twenty-two plato's dialogues
point departure journey gorgias republic laws turned out two destinations
through mouth callicles gorgias presents challenge power politics practiced athenian imperialism depicted thucydides’s account peloponnesian war
domain power politics power ultimate foundation normative principles because alone dictates sustains positive norms refuses recognize any other normative standards
callicles maintains power should rule because law nature constraints power chains cunningly devised weak control strong
seung claims dialogue plato's socrates tries prove callicles's theory power politics wrong fails deliver substantial argument
hence dialogue ends without decisive resolution
then seung holds plato took upon himself task finding effective response callecles's political philosophy power
task became lifelong mission philosophical journey
seung's thesis plato set out overcome callicles's challenge formulating own political philosophy basis eternal normative standards
without appealing such eternal norms impossible talk justice injustice any positive norms because every positive norm just own standard
easy recognize such eternal norms nor any easier use them constructing political institution
hence plato write long series dialogues paved way republic constructed ideal state kallipolis
first half long journey
soon recognized two fatal defects republic
first standard being philosopher-ruler ideal state too high because ruler supposed absolutely intelligent totally incorruptible
superhuman standard well beyond mortals
formulating superhuman ideal plato completely ignored empirical human nature
made same mistake advocating members governing class should allowed neither their own families children nor their own properties
free them chain private interests order make them perfect public servants
plato came realize such drastic measure went against most basic human nature
second fatal defect republic plato's conception knowledge intelligence
important topic because kallipolis governed philosopher-ruler's intelligence knowledge
republic emphatically demarcated knowledge wisdom opinion conjecture
although demarcation sounds commonplace based plato's metaphysical demarcation eternal realm forms temporal realm phenomena
knowledge infallible opinion fallible
scope knowledge restricted domain eternal forms platonic ideas because truly intelligible
become philosopher gaining knowledge eternal forms
temporal phenomena never objects knowledge because ever mutable unintelligible
objects opinion fallible conjecture even philosophers
knowledge forms insufficient governing kallipolis
because situated phenomenal world proper government requires knowledge phenomena
since philosopher-rulers no knowledge phenomena govern their opinion
surely undermines plato's ideal government knowledge wisdom
importance understanding phenomena indirectly acknowledged least once republic
socrates begins recount degeneration kallipolis beginning book says deterioration most likely caused leaders' mistakes handling eugenics future rulers sense perception calculation
without knowledge phenomena indeed impossible avoid mistakes breeding because eugenics takes place phenomenal world
understanding phenomena even critical construction kallipolis because based tripartite theory soul
three classes kallipolis modeled after three parts soul
since there no form soul tripartite theory never knowledge opinion
thus plato's ideal state built opinion rather knowledge
second fatal defect republic
kallipolis turned out product opinion although presented product philosophical wisdom
plato mend these two fatal defects kallipolis reconstruct political philosophy
thus began second half plato's long journey according seung finally concluded laws constructed constitution city magnesia
reconstruction plato eliminates first fatal defect—the superhuman ruler—by replacing rule man rule law
magnesia legal state whose function does totally depend perfect wisdom virtue rulers
citizens magnesia participate governance their state through intricate system councils many different levels
unlike kallipolis magnasia does demand total dedication citizens their rulers well-being state
allowed their own families even private properties although state sets upper lower limits private possessions
plato's acceptance human nature phenomenal world
'statesman' presents myth two ages age kronos age zeus
first age world rolls forward second age world reverses motion rolls backward
age kronos divine rulers govern world their wisdom
age zeus human rulers govern their social order laws
myth interpreted plato's philosophy history metaphysical cosmology
seung interprets plato's explanation shift government virtues republic government laws laws
myth two ages seung says plato expresses realization kallipois unfit our age because living age zeus rather age kronos
plato cannot eliminate second fatal defect kallipolis institutional reforms
tries overcome devising scientific way understanding phenomena
begins project theaetetus introducing two elements perceptual knowledge knowing sameness 2 knowing difference
plato now believes these two methods perception deliver knowledge phenomena
substantiates possibility defining sophist sophist statesman statesman
since objects these definitions belong domain phenomena seung points out entirely different definitions forms
descriptions phenomena deliver knowledge rigorous enough
sure cannot rigorous definition mathematical forms
difference these two types definition like difference square root square number such 4 9 oblong number such 2 3
former rational number latter irrational number
unlike former computation latter never completed
although approximation true value qualitatively different mere guess opinion
since method approximation scientific should regarded knowledge rather opinion
likewise our definition description phenomena such sophists statesman never completed ever approximate ultimate nature phenomena closer closer
plato's revised view how gain knowledge phenomena according seung's interpretation later dialogues
plato's revised view knowledge goes together revised view forms
there long series discussions question whether plato retained theory forms late dialogues
seung scholar advocate thesis plato revised theory forms
explains revision distinguishing simple complex forms
complex forms definable simple forms indefinable
although plato obsessed definition long time seung holds eventually realized complex forms defined simple forms required their definitions
simple forms also called primitive ultimate forms arche greek
cannot known definition known direct intuition
indefinable primitive forms already encountered republic example form good
socrates admits indefinability explains nature analogy sun
second part parmenides seung says plato examines eight possible systems primitive forms eight hypotheses
sophist joins hypotheses 5 7 final system ultimate forms
counts being identity difference motion rest most important ones
late dialogues seung holds plato retains simple forms
revised theory forms
original theory forms never clearly recognized distinction simple complex forms
hence platonic heaven contained forms simple complex
seung labeled plato's old theory forms skyscraper version new theory bedrock version
eidetic population platonic heaven changed fully loaded skyscraper version sparsely loaded bedrock version
skyscraper version forms conceived fully determinate objects definition
bedrock version conceived highly indeterminate basic elements construction complex forms
reason seung says plato changed conception definition
skyscraper version definition art describing nature eternal forms
bedrock version definition became art constructing complex forms using primitive forms demonstrated definitions sophist statesman
seung regards construction kallipolis watershed change because seen construction new form description eternal form
although obviously product construction socrates interlocutors says model laid heaven anyone see rep 592
kallipolis viewed two ways
art construction most continuous theme plato's late dialogues according seung
sophist called art weaving forms proposition
philebus called gift gods human beings divine method
socrates illustrates art dividing vocal sounds vowels consonants construction language art dividing musical sounds organizing them system intervals harmonic scales
seung calls divine art art pythagorean construction because based pythagoreanism
using art plato constructs magnesia rational state laws then entire universe rational cosmos timaeus
locating rational state rational cosmos seung holds plato finally perfected response callicles
gorgias callicles maintained power right rule because law nature any other kind social order futile struggle against power natural order
plato now say natural order beastly rational rational state natural extension cosmic order
thus concluded lifelong mission epic journey
seung's outline plato's epic journey
outline seung devised new way reading plato's dialogues
traditional method read each them self-contained work seung's unique way find their thematic interconnections read them continuing series
says connectionist approach inspired plato's peculiar way naming dialogues
except republic laws none them bear titles indicate their subject matters
sophist statesman may appear exceptions
real topics these two dialogues sophist statesman problems art defining them
why republic laws named after their topics? moreover these two works extended dialogues
former divided ten books latter twelve books
none other dialogues long enough require such division
basis these bibliographical data seung formed hypothesis two long dialogues two destinations plato's epic journey other dialogues stepping stones leading up those end points
every dialogue plato writes usually generates new problems writes another dialogue take up those new problems
seung says dialogues themselves generate their own thematic interconnections
articulating these interconnections seung revealed complex itinerary plato's philosophical journey
seung's book received well reviews notably being identified thomas j
lewis mc master university scholarly tour de force
renowned scholar plato's political theory[citation needed] george klosko university virginia called seung's interpretation dazzling synthesis marked glittering intellectuality
seung's interpretation plato proved influential work j
balkin david lay williams made much bedrock theory forms modern contemporary political philosophy
nietzsche's epic soul 2005 nietzsche’s epic soul thus spoke zarathustra seung develops innovative reading nietzsche’s most abstruse work thus spoke zarathustra
seung’s primary contention nietzsche’s readers paid sufficient attention narrative unity zarathustra
indeed many readers treated work nothing collection disjointed aphorisms speeches parables
most generous interpretations prior seung’s allowed first three parts zarathustra fact constitute coherent narrative
however seung finds troubling tendency these interpretations view fourth final part zarathustra either embarrassing addition first three parts low comedy following tragedy after manner ancient greek theater
seung maintains part iv rather constituting burlesque irrelevant precedes actually depicts fulfillment zarathustra’s previously unrealized ambitions
hence part iv represents epic conclusion spiritual journey trajectory spans part part iv zarathustra
seung accomplishes reading zarathustra decoding distinctive meaning role each part narrative
part zarathustra seung argues protagonist sets out agenda spiritualize secular world
seung careful point out nietzsche’s opposition christianity should mistaken antagonism things spiritual
zarathustra harangues bourgeois ethos secular humanism embodied townspeople marketplace “zarathustra’s prologue” neglecting soul
secular humanists too readily satiated material prosperity other petty forms comfort
effort save humanity pitfalls secular humanism wake god’s death zarathustra erects ideal seung dubs “faustian superman
faustian ideal zarathustra hopes will serve viable replacement old judeo-christian god
whereas god formerly functioned guarantor world’s value now up faustian superman endow world meaning through power creative will
seung refers faustian ideal ideal “sovereign individual
zarathustra’s notion sovereign autonomous individual linked inextricably traditional western notion ego agent situated outside chain natural causes effects
agent sort unmoved mover capable willing events existence without itself being effect causes beyond control
passages part accordingly show zarathustra exulting power creative individual successfully inscribes edicts sovereign will raw material cosmos
many nietzsche’s commentators seen no zarathustra nietzsche matter elevation faustian ideal
seung however does see ideal propounded zarathustra part considered view either zarathustra nietzsche
fact part ii sets faustian ideal conflict another ideal spinozan hero
spinozan hero unlike faustian hero accepts belongs inexorable knot cosmic causes effects
acknowledges lack agent causal
metaphysical power affirms physical/animal being
seung refers spinozan self cosmic self self coextensive cosmic necessity
whereas faustian hero wishes positioned outside nature necessity assert will against them spinozan hero knows lacks power combat necessity
although nietzsche expresses admiration spinoza multiple occasions nietzsche scholars remiss draw any link two thinkers
seung perspicaciously notes “the problem being trapped inexorable web causal chains…was spinoza’s central problem
connection spinoza nietzsche then both concerned preserving spiritual meaning deterministic cosmos
zarathustra however part ii unable stomach being no sum effect causes beyond autonomous control
lacking free will means cannot realize faustian ideal because lacks autonomous will stamp itself upon yielding cosmos
rather molding cosmos must helplessly molded
consequently spiritual agenda laid out part doomed fail much zarathustra’s chagrin
thus part ii zarathustra chronicles suffering human will aspires autonomy under onus cosmic necessity
indeed central struggle book antagonism faustian conception self spinozan conception self
nietzsche essence turned problem free will determinism existential struggle hero zarathustra
part iii stages battle zarathustra’s faustian ideal spinozan ideal represented dwarf
most readers zarathustra posit dwarf part iii force zarathustra must overcome affirm eternal recurrence
seung other hand forcefully argues dwarf zarathustra custodian thought eternal recurrence part iii
zarathustra reacts violently against dwarf’s rendition eternal recurrence because seemingly reduces humans nothing puppets whose every action already decided cycles eternal recurrence
dwarf’s version eternal recurrence seung contends functions poetic metaphor determinism
time circle dwarf proclaims each life already lived innumerable times before then nothing new happen time around
concerning every action will perform lack freedom bring result different happened previous cycles must happen again
lack human freedom consequent absence alternate possibilities precisely entailed deterministic view cosmos given nietzsche’s metaphysical commitments
zarathustra must affirm dwarf’s doctrine eternal recurrence come terms means live deterministic universe
accept living deterministic universe just accept being fully natural being—that being lacks metaphysical power free will
coming terms eternal recurrence thus will force zarathustra give up pretense being faustian superman
instead will forced acknowledge belonging cosmic necessity
however end part iii zarathustra still acknowledged cosmic self
nietzsche expresses longing eternity cosmic knot necessity end part iii “the seven seals” seung observes eternity nowhere found
hence zarathustra’s purported love eternity cannot consummated part iii
seung’s groundbreaking reading already mentioned centers part iv zarathustra
contests “the drunken song” zarathustra finally embraces spinozan self
ceasing aspire autonomy zarathustra instead envisions himself coextensive cosmic necessity
seung puts zarathustra becomes infused power mother nature interchangeable cosmic necessity
seung’s conclusion borne out highly comical section part iv entitled “the ass festival
seung argues ass represents dionysus zarathustra followers actually involved sort dionysian nature worship
zarathustra finally learned love deterministic forces mother nature love animal self—or self nothing part cosmic chain causes effects
zenith zarathustra’s spiritual journey final analysis religious
conceded autonomous will illusory accepted life like lives directed mother nature
power thus consists ability assert autonomous will against cosmos rather giving himself over mother nature
relinquishing autonomous will subsequent acquiescence necessity seems seung argues culminate highly religious experience mother nature zarathustra
might seem ironic nietzsche’s answer death god itself religious
seung confesses last thing expected discover embarked work
nietzsche’s dionysian religion unlike judeo-christian religious tradition preceded naturalized form religion
repudiates metaphysical view human agency girds judeo-christian tradition substituting naturalized vision self means human
seung however issues final warning against taking zarathustra’s dionysian transformation end zarathustra’s travails
end zarathustra appears hero’s faustian self might make resurgence
seung explains contending part means human least stage human history according nietzsche torn our western tradition teaches us ourselves science teaches us ourselves
tradition us believe existence our autonomous wills subsequently our power become faustian ideals
science us believe no different mother nature’s other children subject deterministic mechanisms governing cosmos
nietzsche may think us capable resolving conflict seung reluctant draw any hard conclusions nietzsche’s final views
seung’s work does open up interesting questions nietzsche’s commitment naturalism perhaps most importantly nietzsche scholars reading eternal recurrence highly provocative
while seung’s contention eternal recurrence metaphor determinism original argument nietzsche galvanizes eternal recurrence make us rethink means human deterministic world highly original
nietzsche’s readers might profit reconsidering trend nietzsche studies see nietzsche herald purely faustian ideal
spinozan themes nietzsche’s work might deserve attention
although relatively recently published attracted much positive attention
robert gooding williams university chicago political science review ethics seung's book constitutes major addition philosophical study also sprach zarathustra
robert weldon whalen queens university charlotte neither zarathustra nor seung's nietzsche's epic soul timid rewards each offers justifies work demanded
seung's argument may convince everyone no deny argument's power creativity wisdom

substantiates theory historical knowledge main currents undercurrents european philosophy literature identifying faustian themes nietzsche’s epic associating spinozan naturalism

seung’s interpretation kant’s philosophy 1969–2007 seung published three books kant over span thirty-eight years 1969–2007
kant’s transcendental logic 1969 examines kant’s claim transcendental logic generate priori synthetic propositions
views kant’s transcendental logic extension formal logic
extension made joining formal logic pure intuitions space time pure concepts understanding
although theory pure intuitions discredited emergence non-euclidean physical geometry theory pure concepts remained relatively intact
seung exposed fatal flaw theory
metaphysical deduction kant claims derive logically twelve categories twelve forms judgment
long standard practice dismiss metaphysical deduction kant’s typical opaque passages move transcendental deduction
seung argues practice leads serious misreading first critique
kant assemble categories empirically distinguished empirical concepts
reason openly disdains aristotle’s empirical method collecting categories
logical derivation categories kant believes prove their priori origin because logic priori
their priori origin thus proven kant intends use them logical premise transcendental deduction
seung shows kant’s derivation scheme ill-conceived
forms judgment syntactic elements categories semantic elements
derive latter former derive semantic elements syntactic elements
although logically impossible operation kant proudly flaunted ingenious invention
unfortunately ingenuity thrived exploiting logical fantasy
seung dissected series fraudulent maneuvers derivation categories
fraud recognized neither performer nor audience because executed obscure tricky language
kant’s apriorism generally taken central theme philosophy
seung discovered enduring theme alongside
topic kant’s platonic revolution moral political philosophy 1994 seung explores importance platonism kant
inaugural dissertation seung says kant expressed enthusiasm over platonic ideas first time life
although kant launched project critical philosophy first critique reaffirmed earlier allegiance normative platonism transcendental dialectic included platonic ideas pure concepts reason
emphatically distinguished pure concepts reason categories understanding
although categories indispensable understanding phenomena maintained useless practical reason because provided no normative standards
practical domain says cannot take single step without appealing platonic ideas ultimate normative principles
time kant groundwork metaphysics morals appeared completely disowned normative platonism
does even mention platonic ideas tries spin out moral rules purely formal principles no connection any transcendent entities such platonic ideas
consequently kant scholars rarely recognized relevance platonism ethics
against prevailing tradition seung textually demonstrated platonism essential element critique practical reason metaphysics morals kant’s two ethical treatises after groundwork
plato’s influence limited ethical writings
seung shown platonic ideas also play critical role third critique kant’s philosophy history
finally concludes entire tradition german idealism grown out kant’s enthusiasm platonic ideas
kant guide perplexed 2007 provides overview kant’s philosophical development
development understood struggle reconcile continental rationalism british empiricism produced priori formalism
half story according seung other half kant’s normative platonism
kant’s own language seung says philosophy consists two types elements transcendent transcendental
transcendental elements priori innate subject experience
transcendent elements transcend world experience
former kant’s appropriation cartesian legacy latter adaptation platonic legacy
reconcile these two legacies turned out far difficult task kant task reconciling empiricism rationalism
general scheme synthesis empiricism rationalism complements each other like two sides single body platonic cartesian legacies behave like two bodies conjoined twins
their harmonious union intractable kant revise many times over yet never achieved satisfactory resolution
seung supports verdict solid textual evidence
although three critiques traditionally taken three interlocking segments architectonic system points out their interconnection rarely ever discussed kant scholarship
fact says kant scholarship divided three tightly segregated compartments each clusters around three critiques conducts business without even considering business other two
obviously there no way fit those three pieces together single edifice
seung suggested most sensible way read three critiques take them kant’s three attempts bring together priori formalism normative platonism
fact write critique original design
assumed critique pure reason sufficient laying foundation critical philosophy because there pure reason
basis foundation planning write two metaphysical treatises metaphysics nature metaphysics morals
instead writing these two treatises changed mind first critique second critique
stop there
changed mind once third critique
even first critique marked huge change heart terminated dogmatic slumber inaugural dissertation
seung textually substantiates these three revolutions development kant’s philosophy
seung concludes preface kant following observation “thus three critiques stand milestones marking three successive philosophical revisions
therefore grievous error regard them three segments single unified architecture conventionally understood kant scholarship
these three pieces never joined together single edifice because structurally incompatible each other
their connection understood thematically because mark thematic development kant’s transcendental philosophy
thus seung launched revolution kant scholarship highlighting hitherto neglected kant’s normative platonism elucidating dialectical tension priori formalism
irresolvable conflict own transcendentalism plato’s ancient transcendentism
abandon them integrity other
ironically accomplished kant scholars blithely closing their eyes platonic dimension philosophy
muster courage make decisive move own
destined struggle two-headed monster own creation end life
seung’s startling account kant’s profound epic struggle
