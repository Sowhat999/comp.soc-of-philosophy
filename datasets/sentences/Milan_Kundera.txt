michiko kakutani new york times describes book being knowing pre-emptive joke own superficiality review economist stated book sadly let down tone breezy satire feel forced
writing style philosophy kundera often explicitly identifies characters figments imagination commenting first-person characters entirely third-person stories
kundera concerned words shape mold characters their physical appearance
non-fiction work art novel says reader's imagination automatically completes writer's vision
writer thus wishes focus essential arguing physical critical understanding character
indeed essential may even include interior world psychological world characters
still times specific feature trait may become character's idiosyncratic focus
françois ricard suggested kundera conceives regard overall oeuvre rather limiting ideas scope just novel time
themes meta-themes exist across entire oeuvre
each new book manifests latest stage personal philosophy
these meta-themes include exile identity life beyond border beyond love beyond art beyond seriousness history continual return pleasure less important life
françois ricard 2003 many kundera's characters seem develop expositions these themes expense their full humanity
specifics regard characters tend rather vague
often main character used novel kundera may even completely discontinue character resuming plot somebody new
