hilbert solves gordan's problem hilbert's first work invariant functions led demonstration 1888 famous finiteness theorem
twenty years earlier paul gordan demonstrated theorem finiteness generators binary forms using complex computational approach
attempts generalize method functions two variables failed because enormous difficulty calculations involved
order solve become known circles gordan's problem hilbert realized necessary take completely different path

while demonstrating existence such set constructive proof — display object — rather existence proof relied use law excluded middle infinite extension
hilbert sent results mathematische annalen

axiomatization geometry main article hilbert's axioms text grundlagen geometrie tr
foundations geometry published hilbert 1899 proposes formal set called hilbert's axioms substituting traditional axioms euclid
avoid weaknesses identified those euclid whose works time still used textbook-fashion
difficult specify axioms used hilbert without referring publication history grundlagen since hilbert changed modified them several times
original monograph quickly followed french translation hilbert added v
2 completeness axiom
english translation authorized hilbert made e
townsend copyrighted 1902
translation incorporated changes made french translation considered translation 2 nd edition
hilbert continued make changes text several editions appeared german
7 th edition last appear hilbert's lifetime
new editions followed 7 th main text essentially revised
hilbert's approach signaled shift modern axiomatic method
hilbert anticipated moritz pasch's work 1882
axioms taken self-evident truths
geometry may treat things powerful intuitions necessary assign any explicit meaning undefined concepts
elements such point line plane others substituted hilbert reported schoenflies kötter tables chairs glasses beer other such objects
their defined relationships discussed
hilbert first enumerates undefined concepts point line plane lying relation points lines points planes lines planes betweenness congruence pairs points line segments congruence angles
axioms unify both plane geometry solid geometry euclid single system
23 problems main article hilbert's problems hilbert put forth most influential list 23 unsolved problems international congress mathematicians paris 1900
generally reckoned most successful deeply considered compilation open problems ever produced individual mathematician
after re-working foundations classical geometry hilbert extrapolated rest mathematics
approach differed however later 'foundationalist' russell-whitehead 'encyclopedist' nicolas bourbaki contemporary giuseppe peano
mathematical community whole enlist problems identified crucial aspects areas mathematics took key
problem set launched talk problems mathematics presented during course second international congress mathematicians held paris
introduction speech hilbert gave among us happy lift veil behind hidden future gaze coming developments our science secrets development centuries come? will ends toward spirit future generations mathematicians will tend? methods new facts will new century reveal vast rich field mathematical thought? presented fewer half problems congress published acts congress
subsequent publication extended panorama arrived formulation now-canonical 23 problems hilbert
full text important since exegesis questions still matter inevitable debate whenever asked how many solved
these solved within short time
others discussed throughout 20 th century few now taken unsuitably open-ended come closure
even continue day remain challenge mathematicians
formalism account become standard mid-century hilbert's problem set also kind manifesto opened way development formalist school three major schools mathematics 20 th century
according formalist mathematics manipulation symbols according agreed upon formal rules
therefore autonomous activity thought
there however room doubt whether hilbert's own views simplistically formalist sense
hilbert's program main article hilbert's program 1920 proposed explicitly research project metamathematics then termed became known hilbert's program
wanted mathematics formulated solid complete logical foundation
believed principle done showing mathematics follows correctly chosen finite system axioms such axiom system provably consistent through means such epsilon calculus
seems both technical philosophical reasons formulating proposal
affirmed dislike become known ignorabimus still active issue time german thought traced back formulation emil du bois-reymond
program still recognizable most popular philosophy mathematics usually called formalism
example bourbaki group adopted watered-down selective version adequate requirements their twin projects writing encyclopedic foundational works supporting axiomatic method research tool
approach successful influential relation hilbert's work algebra functional analysis failed engage same way interests physics logic
hilbert 1919 speaking here arbitrariness any sense
mathematics like game whose tasks determined arbitrarily stipulated rules
rather conceptual system possessing internal necessity no means otherwise
hilbert published views foundations mathematics 2-volume work grundlagen mathematik
gödel's work hilbert mathematicians worked enterprise committed project
attempt support axiomatized mathematics definitive principles banish theoretical uncertainties ended failure
gödel demonstrated any non-contradictory formal system comprehensive enough include least arithmetic cannot demonstrate completeness way own axioms
1931 incompleteness theorem showed hilbert's grand plan impossible stated
second point cannot any reasonable way combined first point long axiom system genuinely finitary
nevertheless subsequent achievements proof theory very least clarified consistency relates theories central concern mathematicians
hilbert's work started logic course clarification need understand gödel's work then led development recursion theory then mathematical logic autonomous discipline 1930 s
basis later theoretical computer science alonzo church alan turing also grew directly out 'debate'
functional analysis around 1909 hilbert dedicated himself study differential integral equations work direct consequences important parts modern functional analysis
order carry out these studies hilbert introduced concept infinite dimensional euclidean space later called hilbert space
work part analysis provided basis important contributions mathematics physics next two decades though unanticipated direction
later stefan banach amplified concept defining banach spaces
hilbert spaces important class objects area functional analysis particularly spectral theory self-adjoint linear operators grew up around during 20 th century
physics until 1912 hilbert almost exclusively pure mathematician
planning visit bonn immersed studying physics fellow mathematician friend hermann minkowski joked spend 10 days quarantine before being able visit hilbert
fact minkowski seems responsible most hilbert's physics investigations prior 1912 including their joint seminar subject 1905
1912 three years after friend's death hilbert turned focus subject almost exclusively
arranged physics tutor himself
started studying kinetic gas theory moved elementary radiation theory molecular theory matter
even after war started 1914 continued seminars classes works albert einstein others followed closely
1907 einstein framed fundamentals theory gravity then struggled nearly years confounding problem putting theory final form
early summer 1915 hilbert's interest physics focused general relativity invited einstein göttingen deliver week lectures subject
einstein received enthusiastic reception göttingen
over summer einstein learned hilbert also working field equations redoubled own efforts
during november 1915 einstein published several papers culminating field equations gravitation see einstein field equations
nearly simultaneously david hilbert published foundations physics axiomatic derivation field equations see einstein–hilbert action
hilbert fully credited einstein originator theory no public priority dispute concerning field equations ever arose two men during their lives
see priority
additionally hilbert's work anticipated assisted several advances mathematical formulation quantum mechanics
work key aspect hermann weyl john von neumann's work mathematical equivalence werner heisenberg's matrix mechanics erwin schrödinger's wave equation namesake hilbert space plays important part quantum theory
1926 von neumann showed atomic states understood vectors hilbert space then correspond both schrödinger's wave function theory heisenberg's matrices
throughout immersion physics hilbert worked putting rigor mathematics physics
while highly dependent higher math physicists tended sloppy
pure mathematician like hilbert both ugly difficult understand
began understand physics how physicists using mathematics developed coherent mathematical theory found most importantly area integral equations
colleague richard courant now classic methoden mathematischen physik methods mathematical physics including hilbert's ideas added hilbert's name author even though hilbert directly contributed writing
hilbert physics too hard physicists implying necessary mathematics generally beyond them courant-hilbert book made easier them
number theory hilbert unified field algebraic number theory 1897 treatise zahlbericht literally report numbers
also resolved significant number-theory problem formulated waring 1770
finiteness theorem used existence proof shows there must solutions problem rather providing mechanism produce answers
then little publish subject emergence hilbert modular forms dissertation student means name further attached major area
made series conjectures class field theory
concepts highly influential own contribution lives names hilbert class field hilbert symbol local class field theory
results mostly proved 1930 after work teiji takagi
hilbert work central areas analytic number theory name become known hilbert–pólya conjecture reasons anecdotal
