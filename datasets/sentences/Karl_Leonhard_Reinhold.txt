development kantian standpoint contained new theory human understanding 1789 fundament des philosophischen wissens 1791 called author elementarphilosophie
reinhold lays greater emphasis kant upon unity activity consciousness
principle consciousness tells us every idea related both object subject partly distinguished partly united both
since form cannot produce matter subject cannot produce object forced assume thing-in-itself
notion self-contradictory consciousness essentially relating activity
there therefore something must thought yet cannot thought
work letters kantian philosophy former catholic priest reinhold retained values christian morality individual dignity
basic christian doctrines transcendent god immortal human soul presuppositions thinking
however disagreed friedrich heinrich jacobi thought way avoid nihilism fatalism atheism believe religious morality revealed god
reinhold tried show kant's philosophy provided alternative either religious revelation philosophical skepticism fatalistic pantheism
kant's critique pure reason difficult confusing book
widely read little influence
reinhold decided write comments literary journal german mercury
skipped over beginning middle book started end
reinhold showed book best read backwards starting end section
last part critique kant discussed issues morality their relation rational ideas god free will life after death
these issues reinhold's main concern
presenting these concerns public instead extremely difficult epistemology took up most beginning middle book reinhold aroused great interest
result kant's critique immediately became book great importance
according historian philosophy karl ameriks fichte hegel schelling schiller hölderlin novalis friedrich schlegel developed their thought reaction reinhold's reading kant
there faustian tendency reinhold's assertion person hope future reward because person constantly striving good
moral good merely hope reward
reinhold's emphasis history evident declaration philosophies religions judged way respond needs reason particular era
philosophical development underlying rationality
new philosophies fated struggle repeatedly order survive dialectic history progress unconsciously occurring
regard transcendent god human internal moral law externalized such deity
extreme otherness alienation part rational process
makes possible subsequent deeper regaining self through something other self
establishing kant secure ground kant's critical philosophy being accepted final truth
according professor george di giovanni mc gill university reinhold tried provide foundation kant's philosophy order remedy situation
reinhold distinguished two levels philosophy
most basic level concern consciousness representations occurred
second less basic level concern possibility structure known desired objects
kant's important realization possibility metaphysics established
done describing occurs mind conscious objects
kant's weakness being overly concerned objects themselves
remained second less basic level philosophy
rarely examined occurred consciousness basic level philosophy
kant provide phenomenological description consciousness
reinhold convinced kant should identified fundamental fact consciousness essential making cognition itself possible
reinhold's essay towards new theory human faculty representation description main parts attributes consciousness
writing book reinhold turned attention moral issues kant addressed end section critique pure reason epistemological concerns beginning middle sections
general theory representation thing-in-itself necessarily exists cannot known
human knowledge restricted appearances
reinhold's principle consciousness thinking subject distinguishes his/her consciousness representation mental image both observing subject observed object
certain fact consciousness
observing subject location representation mental image
observed object anything represented being present mind observing subject
reinhold examined necessary conditions representation such subject object must exist order object consciously present
representation's material form representation's material stoff given received manifold sensation unified attributed transcendental object
allows thinking subject distinguish thing-in-itself
representation's form spontaneous unifying act occurs according subject's conditions
allows thinking subject distinguish self-in-itself
self-in-itself thing-in-itself must assumed order thinking subject able make distinction consciousness itself object consciousness
never know anything itself representation
object-in-itself subject-in-itself does matter sensation representational form cannot known
represented known consciousness must contain representation
empirical representation takes material source supposed external
pure representation takes material reflecting consciousness clear distinct consciousness object awareness consciousness itself representation subject external object
special theory cognition cognition clear distinct knowledge consciousness contains representation object
cognition consciousness's awareness own content subject's representation object
