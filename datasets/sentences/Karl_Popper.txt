philosophy main article critical rationalism background popper's ideas karl popper's rejection marxism during teenage years left profound mark thought
point joined socialist association few months 1919 considered himself communist
during time became familiar marxist view economics class-war history
although quickly became disillusioned views expounded marxism flirtation ideology led distance himself those believed spilling blood sake revolution necessary
came realise came sacrificing human lives think act extreme prudence
failure democratic parties prevent fascism taking over austrian politics 1920 s 1930 s traumatised popper
suffered direct consequences failure since events after anschluss annexation austria german reich 1938 forced permanent exile
most important works field social science—the poverty historicism 1944 open society enemies 1945—were inspired reflection events time represented sense reaction prevalent totalitarian ideologies then dominated central european politics
books defended democratic liberalism social political philosophy
also represented extensive critiques philosophical presuppositions underpinning forms totalitarianism
popper puzzled over stark contrast non-scientific character freud adler's theories field psychology revolution set off einstein's theory relativity physics early 20 th century
popper thought einstein's theory theory properly grounded scientific thought method highly risky sense possible deduce consequences light then-dominant newtonian physics highly improbable e
light deflected towards solid bodies—confirmed eddington's experiments 1919 turned out false falsify whole theory
contrast nothing even principle falsify psychoanalytic theories
thus came conclusion psychoanalytic theories common primitive myths genuine science
led popper conclude regarded[by whom?] remarkable strengths psychoanalytical theories actually their weaknesses
psychoanalytical theories crafted way made them able refute any criticism give explanation every possible form human behaviour
nature such theories made impossible any criticism experiment - even principle - show them false
realisation important consequence popper later tackled problem demarcation philosophy science led posit strength scientific theory lies both being susceptible falsification actually being falsified criticism made
considered theory cannot principle falsified criticism scientific theory
philosophy science falsifiability/problem demarcation popper coined term critical rationalism describe philosophy
concerning method science term indicates rejection classical empiricism classical observationalist-inductivist account science grown out
popper argued strongly against latter holding scientific theories abstract nature tested indirectly reference their implications
also held scientific theory human knowledge generally irreducibly conjectural hypothetical generated creative imagination solve problems arisen specific historico-cultural settings
logically no number positive outcomes level experimental testing confirm scientific theory single counterexample logically decisive shows theory implication derived false
say given statement e
statement law scientific theory -- [call t] -- falsifiable does mean t false
rather means t false then principle t shown false observation experiment
popper's account logical asymmetry verification falsifiability lies heart philosophy science
also inspired take falsifiability criterion demarcation genuinely scientific theory should considered scientific falsifiable
led attack claims both psychoanalysis contemporary marxism scientific status basis their theories falsifiable
popper also extensively against famous copenhagen interpretation quantum mechanics
strongly disagreed niels bohr's instrumentalism supported albert einstein's realist approach scientific theories universe
popper's falsifiability resembles charles peirce's nineteenth century fallibilism
clocks clouds 1966 popper remarked wished known peirce's work earlier
life problem solving popper sought explain apparent progress scientific knowledge how our understanding universe seems improve over time
problem arises position truth content our theories even best them cannot verified scientific testing falsified
again context word falsified does refer something being fake rather something
capable being shown false observation experiment
things simply lend themselves being shown false therefore falsifiable
then how growth science appears result growth knowledge? popper's view advance scientific knowledge evolutionary process characterised formula response given problem situation number competing conjectures tentative theories systematically subjected most rigorous attempts falsification possible
process error elimination performs similar function science natural selection performs biological evolution
theories better survive process refutation true rather fit—in other words applicable problem situation hand
consequently just species' biological fitness does ensure continued survival neither does rigorous testing protect scientific theory refutation future
yet appears engine biological evolution over many generations produced adaptive traits equipped deal complex problems survival likewise evolution theories through scientific method may popper's view reflect certain type progress toward interesting problems
popper interplay tentative theories conjectures error elimination refutation scientific knowledge advances toward greater greater problems process very much akin interplay genetic variation natural selection
falsification/problem induction among contributions philosophy claim solved philosophical problem induction
states while there no way prove sun will rise possible formulate theory every day sun will rise does rise particular day theory will falsified will replaced different
until day there no need reject assumption theory true
nor rational according popper make instead complex assumption sun will rise until given day will stop doing day after similar statements additional conditions
such theory true higher probability because cannot attacked easily falsify first sufficient find sun stopped rising falsify second additionally needs assumption given day yet reached
popper held least likely most easily falsifiable simplest theory attributes identified same thing explains known facts should rationally prefer
opposition positivism held theory most likely true should prefer here becomes very apparent
impossible popper argues ensure theory true important falsity detected easily possible
popper david hume agreed there often psychological belief sun will rise tomorrow both denied there logical justification supposition will simply because past
popper writes approached problem induction through hume
hume felt perfectly right pointing out induction cannot logically justified
conjectures refutations p
55 rationality popper held rationality restricted realm empirical scientific theories merely special case general method criticism method finding eliminating contradictions knowledge without ad-hoc-measures
according view rational discussion metaphysical ideas moral values even purposes possible
popper's student w
bartley iii tried radicalise idea made controversial claim criticism go beyond empirical knowledge everything rationally criticised
popper anti-justificationist traditional philosophy misled false principle sufficient reason
thinks no assumption ever needs ever justified lack justification justification doubt
instead theories should tested scrutinised
goal bless theories claims certainty justification eliminate errors them
writes there no such things good positive reasons nor need such things [
[philosophers] obviously cannot quite bring [themselves] believe my opinion let alone right philosophy karl popper p
1043 philosophy arithmetic popper's principle falsifiability runs prima facie difficulties epistemological status mathematics considered
difficult conceive how simple statements arithmetic such 2 + 2 = 4 ever shown false
open falsification scientific
scientific needs explained how informative real world objects events
popper's solution original contribution philosophy mathematics
idea number statement such 2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples taken two senses
sense irrefutable logically true second sense factually true falsifiable
concisely pure mathematics 2 + 2 = 4 true formula applied real world apples open falsification
political philosophy open society enemies poverty historicism popper developed critique historicism defence open society
popper considered historicism theory history develops inexorably necessarily according knowable general laws towards determinate end
argued view principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms authoritarianism totalitarianism
argued historicism founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding nature scientific law prediction
since growth human knowledge causal factor evolution human history since no society predict scientifically own future states knowledge follows argued there no predictive science human history
popper metaphysical historical indeterminism go hand hand
early years popper impressed marxism whether communists socialists
event happened 1919 profound effect during riot caused communists police shot several unarmed people including popper's friends tried free party comrades prison
riot fact part plan leaders communist party connections béla kun tried take power coup popper know time
however knew riot instigators swayed marxist doctrine class struggle produce vastly dead men inevitable revolution brought quickly possible no scruples put life rioters risk achieve their selfish goal becoming future leaders working class
start later criticism historicism
popper began reject marxist historicism associated questionable means later socialism associated placing equality before freedom possible disadvantage equality
1947 popper co-founded mont pelerin society friedrich hayek milton friedman ludwig von mises others although fully agree think tank's charter ideology
specifically unsuccessfully recommended socialists should invited participate emphasis should put hierarchy humanitarian values rather advocacy free market envisioned classical liberalism
paradox tolerance main article paradox tolerance although popper advocate toleration intolerance should tolerated tolerance allowed intolerance succeed completely tolerance threatened
open society enemies argued unlimited tolerance must lead disappearance tolerance
extend unlimited tolerance even those intolerant prepared defend tolerant society against onslaught intolerant then tolerant will destroyed tolerance them
formulation imply instance should suppress utterance intolerant philosophies long counter them rational argument keep them check public opinion suppression certainly most unwise
should claim right suppress them necessary even force may easily turn out prepared meet us level rational argument begin denouncing argument may forbid their followers listen rational argument because deceptive teach them answer arguments use their fists pistols
should therefore claim name tolerance right tolerate intolerant
should claim any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside law should consider incitement intolerance persecution criminal same way should consider incitement murder kidnapping revival slave trade criminal
metaphysics truth early 1934 popper search truth strongest motives scientific discovery
still describes objective knowledge 1972 early concerns much-criticised notion truth correspondence
then came semantic theory truth formulated logician alfred tarski published 1933
popper writes learning 1935 consequences tarski's theory intense joy
theory met critical objections truth correspondence thereby rehabilitated
theory also seemed popper's eyes support metaphysical realism regulative idea search truth
according theory conditions truth sentence well sentences themselves part metalanguage
example sentence snow white true snow white
although many philosophers interpreted continue interpret tarski's theory deflationary theory popper refers theory true replaced corresponds facts
bases interpretation fact examples such described above refer two things assertions facts refer
identifies tarski's formulation truth conditions sentences introduction metalinguistic predicate distinguishes following cases john called true
true john called
first case belongs metalanguage whereas second likely belong object language
hence true possesses logical status redundancy
true other hand predicate necessary making general observations such john telling truth phillip
upon basis along logical content assertions logical content inversely proportional probability popper went develop important notion verisimilitude truthlikeness
intuitive idea behind verisimilitude assertions hypotheses scientific theories objectively measured respect amount truth falsity imply
way theory evaluated less true another quantitative basis popper emphasises forcefully nothing subjective probabilities other merely epistemic considerations
simplest mathematical formulation popper gives concept found tenth chapter conjectures refutations
here defines verisimilitude measure content truth measure content falsity
popper's original attempt define just verisimilitude actual measure turned out inadequate
however inspired wealth new attempts
cosmological pluralism main article popperian cosmology knowledge popper objective both sense objectively true truthlike also sense knowledge ontological status
knowledge object independent knowing subject objective knowledge evolutionary approach 1972
proposed three worlds world being physical world physical states world two being world mind mental states ideas perceptions world three being body human knowledge expressed manifold forms products second world made manifest materials first world
books papers paintings symphonies products human mind
world three argued product individual human beings exactly same sense animal path product individual animals such existence evolution independent any individual knowing subjects
influence world three view individual human mind world two least strong influence world
other words knowledge held given individual mind owes least much total accumulated wealth human knowledge made manifest world direct experience
such growth human knowledge function independent evolution world three
many contemporary philosophers such daniel dennett embraced popper's three world conjecture due mostly seems resemblance mind-body dualism
origin evolution life creation–evolution controversy united states raises issue whether creationistic ideas may legitimately called science whether evolution itself may legitimately called science
debate both sides even courts their decisions frequently invoked popper's criterion falsifiability see daubert standard
context passages written popper frequently quoted speaks such issues himself
example famously stated darwinism testable scientific theory metaphysical research program—a possible framework testable scientific theories
continued yet theory invaluable
see how without our knowledge grown done since darwin
trying explain experiments bacteria become adapted say penicillin quite clear greatly helped theory natural selection
although metaphysical sheds much light upon very concrete very practical researches
allows us study adaptation new environment such penicillin-infested environment rational way suggests existence mechanism adaptation allows us even study detail mechanism work
also noted theism presented explaining adaptation worse open admission failure created impression ultimate explanation reached
popper later speaking here darwinism shall speak today's theory—that darwin's own theory natural selection supported mendelian theory heredity theory mutation recombination genes gene pool decoded genetic code
immensely impressive powerful theory
claim completely explains evolution course bold claim very far being established
scientific theories conjectures even those successfully passed many severe varied tests
mendelian underpinning modern darwinism well tested theory evolution says terrestrial life evolved few primitive unicellular organisms possibly even single organism
1974 regarding dna origin life makes origin life genetic code disturbing riddle genetic code without any biological function unless translated unless leads synthesis proteins whose structure laid down code
monod points out machinery cell least non-primitive cell know translates code consists least fifty macromolecular components themselves coded dna
monod 1970 1971 143
thus code translated except using certain products translation
constitutes really baffling circle vicious circle seems any attempt form model theory genesis genetic code
thus may faced possibility origin life like origin universe becomes impenetrable barrier science residue attempts reduce biology chemistry physics
explained difficulty testing led people describe natural selection tautology too past described theory almost tautological tried explain how theory untestable tautology yet great scientific interest my solution doctrine natural selection most successful metaphysical research programme
raises detailed problems many fields tells us expect acceptable solution these problems
still believe natural selection works way research programme
nevertheless changed my mind testability logical status theory natural selection am glad opportunity make recantation
popper summarised new view follows theory natural selection may formulated far tautological
case testable turns out strictly universally true
there seem exceptions many biological theories considering random character variations natural selection operates occurrence exceptions surprising
thus phenomena evolution explained natural selection alone
yet every particular case challenging research program show how far natural selection possibly held responsible evolution particular organ behavioural program
these frequently quoted passages very small part popper issue evolution however give wrong impression mainly discussed questions falsifiability
popper never invented criterion give justifiable use words like science
fact popper says beginning logic scientific discovery aim define science science fact defined quite arbitrarily
popper own sophisticated views evolution go much beyond frequently-quoted passages say
effect popper agreed points both creationists naturalists also disagreed both views crucial aspects
popper understood universe creative entity invents new things including life without necessity something like god especially pulling strings behind curtain
evolution must creationists say work goal-directed way disagreed their view must necessarily hand god imposes these goals onto stage life
instead formulated spearhead model evolution version genetic pluralism
according model living organisms themselves goals act according these goals each guided central control
most sophisticated form brain humans controls also exist much less sophisticated ways species lower complexity such amoeba
control organ plays special role evolution—it spearhead evolution
goals bring purpose world
mutations genes determine structure control may then cause drastic changes behaviour preferences goals without having impact organism's phenotype
popper postulates such purely behavioural changes less likely lethal organism compared drastic changes phenotype
popper contrasts views notion hopeful monster large phenotype mutations calls hopeful behavioural monster
after behaviour changed radically small quick changes phenotype follow make organism fitter changed goals
way looks phenotype changing guided invisible hand while merely natural selection working combination new behaviour
example according hypothesis eating habits giraffe must changed before elongated neck evolved
popper contrasted view evolution within active darwinism organism actively trying discover new ways life being quest conquering new ecological niches naturalistic evolution without picture hostile environment trying kill mostly passive organism perhaps segregate groups
popper key figure encouraging patent lawyer günter wächtershäuser publish iron–sulfur world theory abiogenesis criticism soup theory
creation-evolution controversy popper considered somewhat sensational clash brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning history various species animals plants earth older metaphysical theory incidentally happened part established religious belief footnote effect [he] agree[s] professor c
raven science religion future 1943 calls conflict storm victorian tea-cup though force remark perhaps little impaired attention pays vapours still emerging cup—to great systems evolutionist philosophy produced bergson whitehead smuts others
free will popper john eccles speculated problem free will many years generally agreeing interactionist dualist theory mind
however although popper body-mind dualist think mind substance separate body thought mental psychological properties aspects people distinct physical ones
gave second arthur holly compton memorial lecture 1965 popper revisited idea quantum indeterminacy source human freedom
eccles suggested critically poised neurons might influenced mind assist decision
popper criticised compton's idea amplified quantum events affecting decision
idea alternative determinism just sheer chance taken over schlick together many views subject hume asserted removal called physical necessity must result same thing chance
objects must either conjoin'd
'tis impossible admit any medium betwixt chance absolute necessity
shall later argue against important doctrine according alternative determinism sheer chance
yet must admit doctrine seems hold good quantum-theoretical models designed explain least illustrate possibility human freedom
seems reason why these models very unsatisfactory
hume's schlick's ontological thesis there cannot exist anything intermediate chance determinism seems me highly dogmatic say doctrinaire clearly absurd understandable assumption believed complete determinism chance no status except symptom our ignorance
popper called something chance necessity combination randomness control explain freedom though yet explicitly two stages random chance before controlled decision saying freedom just chance rather result subtle interplay something almost random haphazard something like restrictive selective control
then 1977 book john eccles self brain popper finally formulates two-stage model temporal sequence
compares free will darwinian evolution natural selection new ideas striking similarity genetic mutations
now let us look moment genetic mutations
mutations seems brought quantum theoretical indeterminacy including radiation effects
accordingly also probabilistic themselves originally selected adequate them there subsequently operates natural selection eliminates inappropriate mutations
now conceive similar process respect new ideas free-will decisions similar things
say range possibilities brought probabilistic quantum mechanically characterised set proposals possibilities brought forward brain
these there then operates kind selective procedure eliminates those proposals those possibilities acceptable mind
religion god interview popper gave 1969 condition shall kept secret until after death summarised position god follows don't know whether god exists
forms atheism arrogant ignorant should rejected agnosticism—to admit don't know search—is right
look call gift life feel gratitude tune religious ideas god
however moment even speak am embarrassed may something wrong god talking god
objected organised religion saying tends use name god vain noting danger fanaticism because religious conflicts whole thing goes back myths though may kernel truth untrue
why then should jewish myth true indian egyptian myths true? letter unrelated interview stressed tolerant attitude although am religion think should show respect anybody believes honestly
influence sir karl popper 1990 popper played vital role establishing philosophy science vigorous autonomous discipline within philosophy through own prolific influential works also through influence own contemporaries students
popper founded 1946 department philosophy logic scientific method london school economics there lectured influenced both imre lakatos paul feyerabend two foremost philosophers science next generation philosophy science
lakatos significantly modified popper's position1 feyerabend repudiated entirely work both deeply influenced popper engaged many problems popper set
while there dispute matter influence popper long-standing close friendship economist friedrich hayek also brought london school economics vienna
each found support similarities other's work citing each other often though without qualification
letter hayek 1944 popper stated think learnt you any other living thinker except perhaps alfred tarski
popper dedicated conjectures refutations hayek
part hayek dedicated collection papers studies philosophy politics economics popper 1982
ever since logik forschung first came out 1934 complete adherent general theory methodology
popper also long mutually influential friendships art historian ernst gombrich biologist peter medawar neuroscientist john carew eccles
german jurist reinhold zippelius uses popper's method trial error legal philosophy
popper's influence both through work philosophy science through political philosophy also extended beyond academy
popper's students london school economics george soros later became billionaire investor among whose philanthropic foundations open society institute think-tank named honour popper's open society enemies
criticism most criticisms popper's philosophy falsification error elimination element account problem solving
intended ideal practical method effective human problem solving such current conclusions science stronger pseudo-sciences non-sciences insofar survived particularly vigorous selection method
does argue any such conclusions therefore true describes actual methods any particular scientist
[citation needed] rather recommended ideal method enacted system community will lead slow steady progress sort relative how well system community enacts method
suggested popper's ideas often mistaken hard logical account truth because historical co-incidence their appearing same time logical positivism followers mistook aims their own
quine-duhem thesis argues it's impossible test single hypothesis own since each comes part environment theories
thus say whole package relevant theories collectively falsified cannot conclusively say element package must replaced
example given discovery planet neptune motion uranus found match predictions newton's laws theory there seven planets solar system rejected newton's laws themselves
popper discussed critique naïve falsificationism chapters 3 4 logic scientific discovery
popper theories accepted rejected via sort selection process
theories say way things appear preferred over those generally applicable theory greater value
thus newton's laws their wide general application preferred over much specific solar system seven planets
[dubious discuss] thomas kuhn influential book structure scientific revolutions argued scientists work series paradigms falsificationist methodologies make science impossible no theory ever solves puzzles confronted given time nor solutions already achieved often perfect
contrary just incompleteness imperfection existing data-theory fit any given time define many puzzles characterize normal science
any every failure fit ground theory rejection theories ought rejected times
other hand severe failure fit justifies theory rejection then popperians will require criterion improbability degree falsification
developing will almost certainly encounter same network difficulties haunted advocates various probabilistic verification theories [that evaluative theory cannot itself legitimated without appeal another evaluative theory leading regress] popper's student imre lakatos attempted reconcile kuhn's work falsificationism arguing science progresses falsification research programs rather specific universal statements naïve falsificationism
another popper's students paul feyerabend ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology argued universal method characterising scientific progress anything goes
popper claimed recognised already 1934 version logic discovery fact later stressed kuhn scientists necessarily develop their ideas within definite theoretical framework extent anticipated kuhn's central point normal science
popper criticised saw kuhn's relativism
also collection conjectures refutations growth scientific knowledge harper & row 1963 popper writes science must begin myths criticism myths neither collection observations nor invention experiments critical discussion myths magical techniques practices
scientific tradition distinguished pre-scientific tradition having two layers
like latter passes theories also passes critical attitude towards them
theories passed dogmas rather challenge discuss them improve upon them
another objection possible demonstrate falsehood definitively especially using statistical criteria evaluate null hypothesis
generally clear evidence contradicts hypothesis sign flaws hypothesis rather flaws evidence
however misunderstanding popper's philosophy science sets out
rather offering set instructions merely need followed diligently achieve science popper makes clear logic scientific discovery belief resolution conflicts hypotheses observations matter collective judgment scientists each individual case
book called science versus crime houck writes popper's falsificationism questioned logically clear how popper deal statement like every metal there temperature will melt
hypothesis cannot falsified any possible observation there will higher temperature tested metal may fact melt yet seems valid scientific hypothesis
these examples pointed out carl gustav hempel
hempel came acknowledge logical positivism's verificationism untenable argued falsificationism equally untenable logical grounds alone
simplest response because popper describes how theories attain maintain lose scientific status individual consequences currently accepted scientific theories scientific sense being part tentative scientific knowledge both hempel's examples fall under category
instance atomic theory implies metals melt temperature
early adversary popper's critical rationalism karl-otto apel attempted comprehensive refutation popper's philosophy
transformation philosophie 1973 apel charged popper being guilty amongst other things pragmatic contradiction
charles taylor accuses popper exploiting worldwide fame epistemologist diminish importance philosophers 20 th century continental tradition
according taylor popper's criticisms completely baseless received attention respect popper's intrinsic worth hardly merits
2004 philosopher psychologist michel ter hark groningen netherlands published book called popper otto selz rise evolutionary epistemology claimed popper took ideas tutor german psychologist otto selz
selz never published ideas partly because rise nazism forced quit work 1933 prohibition referring selz' work
popper historian ideas scholarship criticised academic quarters rejection plato hegel marx
according john n
gray popper held theory scientific far falsifiable should given up soon falsified
applying popper's account scientific method gray's straw dogs states killed theories darwin einstein birth
first advanced gray claims each them odds available evidence later evidence become available gave them crucial support
against gray seeks establish irrationalist thesis progress science comes acting against reason
gray does however give any indication available evidence these theories odds appeal crucial support illustrates very inductivist approach science popper sought show logically illegitimate
according popper einstein's theory least equally well corroborated newton's upon initial conception both equally well accounted hitherto available evidence
moreover since einstein also explained empirical refutations newton's theory general relativity immediately deemed suitable tentative acceptance popperian account
indeed popper several decades before gray's criticism reply critical essay imre lakatos true used terms elimination even rejection discussing refutation
clear my main discussion these terms mean applied scientific theory eliminated contender truth- refuted necessarily abandoned
moreover often pointed out any such refutation fallible
typical matter conjecture risk-taking whether accept refutation furthermore whether abandon theory say modify even stick try find alternative methodologically acceptable way round problem involved
conflate even admitted falsity need abandon theory may seen fact frequently pointed out einstein regarded general relativity false yet better approximation truth newton's gravitational theory
certainly abandon
worked end life attempt improve upon way further generalization
