theology traditional view gregory orthodox trinitarian theologian influenced neoplatonism plotinus believed universal salvation following origen
however highly original sophisticated thinker gregory difficult classify many aspects theology contentious among both conservative eastern orthodox theologians western academic scholarship
often due lack systematic structure presence terminological inconsistencies gregory's work
conception trinity gregory following basil defined trinity essence [οὐσία] three persons [ὑποστάσεις] formula adopted council constantinople 381
like other cappadocian fathers homoousian against eunomius affirms truth consubstantiality trinity over eunomius' aristotelian belief father's substance unengendered whereas son's engendered
according gregory differences three persons trinity reside their relationships each other triune nature god revealed through divine action despite unity god action
son therefore defined begotten father holy spirit proceeding father son father role progenitor
however doctrine seem subordinate son father holy spirit son
robert jenson suggests gregory implies each member godhead individual priority son epistemological priority father ontic priority spirit metaphysical priority
other commentators disagree morwenna ludlow instance argues epistemic priority resides primarily spirit gregory's theology
modern proponents social trinitarianism often claim influenced cappadocians' dynamic picture trinity
however fundamentally incorrect identify gregory social trinitarian theology emphasises unity god's will clearly believes identities trinity three persons relations them
infinitude god th century mosaic gregory nyssa
saint sophia cathedral kiev ukraine
gregory first theologians argue opposition origen god infinite
main argument infinity god found against eunomius god's goodness limitless god's goodness essential god also limitless
important consequence gregory's belief infinity god belief god limitless essentially incomprehensible limited minds created beings
life moses gregory writes
every concept comes comprehensible image approximate understanding guessing divine nature constitutes idol god does proclaim god
gregory's theology thus apophatic proposed god should defined terms know rather might speculate
accordingly nyssen taught due god's infinitude created being never reach understanding god thus man both life afterlife there constant progression [ἐπέκτασις] towards unreachable knowledge god individual continually transcends reached before
life moses gregory speaks three stages spiritual growth initial darkness ignorance then spiritual illumination finally darkness mind mystic contemplation god cannot comprehended
universalism gregory seems believed universal salvation human beings
gregory argues paul says god will cor
1528 means though may need long time purification eventually no being will remain outside number saved no being created god will fall outside kingdom god
gregory also described god's work way [god's] end complete whole our race shall perfected first man last—some having once life cleansed evil others having afterwards necessary periods healed fire others having their life here unconscious equally good evil—to offer every us participation blessings scripture tells us 'eye hath seen nor ear heard' nor thought ever reached
gregory believed taught affirmed most scholars
minority scholars argued gregory affirmed universal resurrection
life moses gregory writes just darkness left egyptians after three days perhaps redemption [ἀποκατάστασις] will extended those suffering hell [γέεννα]
salvation may extend humans following origen there passages seems suggest albeit through voice macrina even demons will place christ's world goodness
gregory's interpretations corinthians 1528 things shall subdued unto
philippians 210 name jesus every knee should bow things heaven things earth things under earth support understanding theology
however great catechism gregory suggests while every human will resurrected salvation will accorded baptised although also states others driven their passions saved after being purified fire
while believes there will no evil hereafter arguable does preclude belief god might justly damn sinners eternity
thus main difference gregory's conception ἀποκατάστασις origen gregory believes mankind will collectively returned sinlessness whereas origen believes personal salvation will universal
interpretation gregory criticized recently however
attempting reconcile these disparate positions orthodox theologian mario baghos notes taken face value saint seems contradicting himself these passages hand asserted salvation complete eradication evil other fire needed purge evil ‘sleepless’
solution inconsistency view any allusion universal salvation st gregory expression god’s intention humanity fact attested holy sister states god “one goal […] straightway even life purified evil others healed hereafter through fire appropriate length time
choose either accept ignore purification confirmed saint’s many exhortations freely undertake virtuous path
ilaria ramelli made observation gregory free will compatible universal salvation since every person eventually accept good having gone through purification
anthropology gregory's anthropology founded ontological distinction created uncreated
man material creation thus limited infinite immortal soul indefinite capacity grow closer divine
gregory believed soul created simultaneous creation body opposition origen believed preexistence embryos thus persons
gregory human being exceptional being created image god
humanity theomorphic both having self-awareness free will latter gives each individual existential power because gregory disregarding god negates one's own existence
song songs gregory metaphorically describes human lives paintings created apprentices master apprentices human wills imitate their master's work life christ beautiful colors virtues thus man strives reflection christ
gregory stark contrast most thinkers age saw great beauty fall adam's sin two perfect humans eventually arise myriad
gregory also first christian voices say slavery institution inherently sinful
believed slavery violated mankind's inherent worth nature humanity free departure classical judeo-christian precedent rooted genesis arguing man given mastery animals mankind
although aspects slave system criticized stoics such seneca first sustained critique institution slavery itself made ancient world
homilies ecclesiastes 'i got me slave-girls slaves
price tell me? you find existence worth much human nature? price you put rationality? how many obols you reckon equivalent likeness god? how many staters you get selling being shaped god? god let us make man our own image likeness
likeness god rules whole earth granted authority over everything earth god buyer tell me? seller? god alone belongs power rather even god himself
gracious gifts says irrevocable
god therefore reduce human race slavery since himself enslaved sin spontaneously recalled us freedom
god does enslave free sets own power above god's? neoplatonism there many similarities gregory's theology neoplatonist philosophy especially plotinus
specifically share idea reality god completely inaccessible human beings man come see god through spiritual journey knowledge [γνῶσις] rejected favour meditation
gregory does refer any neoplatonist philosophers work there disputed passage may directly quote plotinus
considering seems possible gregory familiar plotinus perhaps other figures neoplatonism
however significant differences neoplatonism gregory's thought exist such gregory's statement beauty goodness equivalent contrasts plotinus' view two different qualities
eastern orthodox theologians generally critical theory gregory influenced neoplatonism
example metropolitan hierotheos nafpaktos argues life after death gregory opposed philosophical opposed theological endeavour tainted worldliness
view supported against euthonius gregory denounces euthonius placing results systematic aristotelean philosophy above traditional teachings church

gregory's work received little scholarly attention west until mid-twentieth century historically treated minor figure comparison basil great gregory nazianzus
late 1942 hans urs von balthasar work virtually unknown
part due scholarship balthasar jean daniélou 1950 s gregory became subject much serious theological research critical edition work published gregorii nysseni opera founding international colloquium gregory nyssa
attention continued present day
modern studies mainly focused gregory's eschatology rather dogmatic writings gained reputation unconventional thinker whose thought arguably prefigures postmodernism

commentary gregory 787 ad seventh ecumenical council church also known second council nicea honored gregory nyssa let us then consider venerable doctors indomitable champions church

[gregory] taught creation potential
god imparted matter fundamental properties laws
objects completed forms universe developed gradually out chaotic material
anthony meredith writes gregory's mystical apophatic writings book gregory nyssa early church fathers 1999 gregory often credited discovery mystical theology rather perception darkness appropriate symbol under god discussed
there much truth
gregory seems first christian writer made important point
kameron carter writes gregory's stance slavery book race theological account 2008 interests me defining features gregory's vision just society unequivocal stance against 'the peculiar institution slavery' call manumission slaves
am interested reading gregory fourth century abolitionist intellectual
outlook surpassed st
paul's moderate fair paul moment revolutionary stance subject also those ancient intellectuals -- pagan jewish christian - aristotle cicero augustine christian west contemporary golden mouthed preacher himself john crysotom east
indeed world wait another fifteen centuries -- until nineteenth century late modern abolitionist movement -- before such unequivocal stance against slavery appear again
