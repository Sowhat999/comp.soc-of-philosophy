fact oresme attended royally sponsored subsidized college navarre institution students too poor pay their expenses while studying university paris makes probable came peasant family
oresme studied artes paris together jean buridan so-called founder french school natural philosophy albert saxony perhaps marsilius inghen there received magister artium
already regent master arts 1342 during crisis over william ockham's natural philosophy

oresme's scientific work cosmology page oresme's livre du ciel et du monde 1377 showing celestial spheres livre du ciel et du monde oresme discussed range evidence against daily rotation earth axis
astronomical considerations maintained earth moving celestial spheres movements see heavens computed astronomers appear exactly same spheres rotating around earth
rejected physical argument earth moving air left behind causing great wind east west
view earth water air share same motion
scriptural passage speaks motion sun concludes passage conforms customary usage popular speech taken literally
also noted economical small earth rotate axis immense sphere stars
nonetheless concluded none these arguments conclusive everyone maintains think myself heavens move earth
critiques astrology mathematical work oresme developed notion incommensurate fractions fractions expressed powers another made probabilistic statistical arguments their relative frequency
argued very probable length day year incommensurate irrational indeed periods motions moon planets
noted planetary conjunctions oppositions never recur quite exactly same way
oresme maintained disproves claims astrologers thinking know punctual exactness motions aspects conjunctions oppositions… [judge] rashly erroneously future events
oresme's critique astrology livre de divinacions treats having six parts
first essentially astronomy movements heavenly bodies considers good science precisely knowable
second part deals influences heavenly bodies earthly events scales
oresme does deny such influence states line commonly held opinion either arrangements heavenly bodies signify events purely symbolically actually cause such events deterministically
mediaevalist chauncey wood remarks major elision makes very difficult determine believed astrology
third part concerns predictiveness covering events three different scales great events such plagues famines floods wars weather winds storms medicine influences humours four aristotelian fluids body
oresme criticizes these misdirected though accepts prediction legitimate area study argues effect weather less well known effect great events
observes sailors farmers better predicting weather astrologers specifically attacks astrological basis prediction noting correctly zodiac moved relative fixed stars because precession equinoxes since zodiac first described ancient times
these first three parts oresme considers physical influences stars planets including sun moon earth while offers critiques them accepts effects exist
last three parts oresme considers concern good bad fortune
interrogations meaning asking stars things such business deals elections meaning choosing best time things such getting married fighting war nativities meaning natal astrology birth charts forms much modern astrological practice
oresme classifies interrogations elections totally false arts critique nativities measured
denies any path predetermined heavenly bodies because humans free will accepts heavenly bodies influence behaviour habitual mood via combination humours each person
overall oresme's skepticism strongly shaped understanding scope astrology
accepts things modern skeptic reject rejects things — such knowability planetary movements effects weather — accepted modern science
sense perception discussing propagation light sound oresme adopted common medieval doctrine multiplication species developed optical writers such alhacen robert grosseteste roger bacon john pecham witelo
oresme maintained these species immaterial corporeal
three-dimensional entities
translations like most scholarly contemporaries oresme primarily latin urging king charles v also french providing french versions own works selected works aristotle
mathematics oresme's most important contributions mathematics contained tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum
quality accidental form such heat distinguished intensio degree heat each point extensio length heated rod
these two terms often replaced latitudo longitudo
sake clarity oresme conceived idea visualizing these concepts plane figures approaching now call rectangular co-ordinates
intensity quality represented length latitudo proportional intensity erected perpendicular base given point base line represents longitudo
oresme proposed geometrical form such figure regarded corresponding characteristic quality itself
oresme defined uniform quality represented line parallel longitude any other quality difform
uniformly varying qualities represented straight line inclined axis longitude while described many cases nonuniformly varying qualities
oresme extended doctrine figures three dimensions
considered analysis applicable many different qualities such hotness whiteness sweetness
significantly later developments oresme applied concept analysis local motion latitudo intensity represented speed longitudo represented time area figure represented distance travelled
shows method figuring latitude forms applicable movement point condition time taken longitude speed latitude quantity then space covered given time
virtue transposition theorem latitudo uniformiter difformis became law space traversed case uniformly varied motion thus oresme published taught over two centuries prior galileo´s making famous
diagrams velocity accelerating object against time latitude forms jacobus de sancto martino sometimes attributed oresme cited credit oresme discovery proto bar charts
significantly oresme developed first proof divergence harmonic series something replicated later centuries bernoulli brothers
proof requiring less advanced mathematics current standard tests divergence example integral test begins noting any n power 2 there n/2 terms series 1/n/2 1/n
each these terms least 1/n since there n/2 them sum least 1/2
instance there term 1/2 then two terms 1/3+1/4 together sum least 1/2 then four terms 1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8 also sum least 1/2
thus series must greater series + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 +
+ 1/2 does finite limit
proves harmonic series must divergent
argument shows sum first n terms grows correct within multiplicative constant
oresme first mathematician prove fact after proof lost proven again until 17 th century pietro mengoli
also worked fractional powers notion probability over infinite sequences ideas further developed next three five centuries respectively
