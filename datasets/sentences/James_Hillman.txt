psyche-pathos-logos “speech suffering soul” soul’s suffering meaning
great portion hillman’s thought attempts attend speech soul revealed via images fantasies
archetypal psychology brief account 2006 written 1981 chapter enciclopedia del novecento italy published hillman 1983 basic introduction mythic psychology
summarizes major themes set out earlier comprehensive work re-visioning psychology 1975
poetic basis mind places psychological activities realm images
seeks explore images rather explain them
within idea re-working images giving them attention shaping forming them until clear possible then therapeutic process hillman calls soul making takes place
hillman equates psyche soul seeks set out psychology based without shame art culture
goal draw soul world via creative acts individual exclude name social order
potential soulmaking revealed psychic images person drawn apprehends meaningful way
indeed act being drawn looking deeper images presented creates meaning soul
further hillman's project sense dream basic model psyche
set out fully dream underworld 1979
text hillman suggests dreams show us diverse taking very different roles experiencing fragments meaning tip consciousness
also place us inside images rather images inside us
move turns traditional epistemology head
source knowing descartes' rather there world full images inhabits
hillman further suggests new understanding psychopathology
stresses importance psychopathology human experience replaces medical understanding poetic
idea sickness vital part way soul person illusive subjective phenomenon becomes known
dream analysis main article dream analysis because archetypal psychology concerned fantasy myth image surprising dreams considered significant relation soul soul-making
hillman does believe dreams simply random residue flotsam waking life advanced physiologists neither does believe dreams compensatory struggles waking life invested “secret” meanings how should live jung
rather “dreams tell us do” 1979
therefore hillman against traditional interpretive methods dream analysis
hillman’s approach phenomenological rather analytic breaks dream down constituent parts interpretive/hermeneutic may make dream image “something other” appears dream
famous dictum regard dream content process “stick image
example hillman 1983 discusses patient's dream huge black snake
dream work include keeping snake describing rather making something other snake
hillman notes moment you've defined snake interpreted you've lost snake you've stopped person leaves hour concept my repressed sexuality my cold black passions
you've lost snake
task analysis keep snake there black snake
see black snake's no longer necessary moment it's interpreted you don't need your dreams any because they've interpreted p
inquire snake presented dream psyche draw forth lair unconscious
snake huge black else? molting shedding skin? sunning itself rock? digesting prey? descriptive strategy keeps image alive hillman's opinion offers possibility understanding psyche
soul's code hillman's 1997 book soul's code search character calling outlines calls acorn theory soul
theory states people already hold potential unique possibilities inside themselves much acorn holds pattern oak tree
books describes how unique individual energy soul contained within each human being displayed throughout their lifetime shown their calling life's work fully actualized
hillman argues against nature nurture explanations individual growth suggesting third kind energy individual soul responsible much individual character aspiration achievement
also argues against other environmental external factors being sole determinants individual growth including parental fallacy dominant psychoanalysis whereby our parents seen crucial determining supplying us genetic material conditioning behavioral patterns
while acknowledging importance external factors blossoming seed argues against attributing human individuality character achievement these factors
book suggests reconnection third superior factor discovering our individual nature determining our life's calling
hillman suggests reappraisal each individual their own childhood present life try find their particular calling seed their own acorn
written help precipitate re-souling world space rationality psychology
complements notion growing up notion growing down 'rooting earth' becoming grounded order individual further grow
hillman incorporates logic rational thought well reference case histories well known people society whose daimons considered clearly displayed actualized discussion daimon
arguments also considered line puer aeternus eternal youth whose brief burning existence seen work romantic poets like keats byron recently deceased young rock stars like jeff buckley kurt cobain
hillman also rejects causality defining framework suggests place shifting form fate whereby events inevitable bound expressed way dependent character soul individual
criticism classical jungian perspective hillman's archetypal psychology contrarian school thought since discarded essentials jungian psychology
term 'archetypal' gives impression school based jung's understanding archetype
yet walter odajnyk argues hillman should called school 'imaginal' psychology since really based hillman's understanding imagination
hillman also rejected individuation central jungian psychology
wolfgang giegerich argues hillman's work exists 'bubble irreality' outside time
it's form 'static platonism' impervious developmental change
hillman's psychology immunisation imaginal historical process become inherent very form
hillman considers work expression 'puer aeternus' eternal youth fairy tale lives eternal dream-state resistant growing up
yet david tacey maintains denial maturational impulse will lead happening anyway negative form
holds hillman's model 'unmade' missing developmental element thought throwing out heroic pattern consciousness idea individuation hillman no longer appealed most psychologists therapists
transgressing professional ethics no longer appealed training institutes
marie-louise von franz regards identification 'puer aeternus' neurosis belonging narcissistic spectrum
against hillman argued puer under sway mother complex best seen relation senex father archetype
however tacey says puer cannot dissociated mother intellectual reconfiguration
these figures archetypally bound why intellectual trickery separate them? wrenching puer mother father display intellectual deceit self-serving purpose
