racism antisemitism caricature wagner karl clic viennese satirical magazine humoristische blätter 1873
exaggerated features refer rumours wagner's jewish ancestry
wagner's writings jews corresponded existing trends thought germany during 19 th century however despite very public views these themes throughout life wagner jewish friends colleagues supporters
there frequent suggestions antisemitic stereotypes represented wagner's operas
characters mime ring sixtus beckmesser die meistersinger klingsor parsifal sometimes claimed jewish representations though identified such librettos these operas
[n 19] topic wagner jews further complicated allegations may credited wagner himself jewish ancestry via supposed father geyer
biographers asserted wagner final years came believe racialist philosophy arthur de gobineau notably gobineau's belief western society doomed because miscegenation superior inferior races
according robert gutman theme reflected opera parsifal
other biographers such lucy beckett believe true original drafts story date back 1857 wagner completed libretto parsifal 1877 displayed no significant interest gobineau until 1880
other interpretations wagner's ideas amenable socialist interpretations many ideas art being formulated time revolutionary inclinations 1840 s

there continues debate extent wagner's views might influenced nazi thinking
[n 22] houston stewart chamberlain 1855–1927 married wagner's daughter eva 1908 never met wagner author racist book foundations nineteenth century approved nazi movement
chamberlain met hitler number occasions 1923 1927 bayreuth cannot credibly regarded conduit wagner's own views
nazis used those parts wagner's thought useful propaganda ignored suppressed rest
while bayreuth presented useful front nazi culture wagner's music used many nazi events nazi hierarchy whole share hitler's enthusiasm wagner's operas resented attending these lengthy epics hitler's insistence
guido fackler researched evidence indicates possible wagner's music used dachau concentration camp 1933–34 reeducate political prisoners exposure national music
