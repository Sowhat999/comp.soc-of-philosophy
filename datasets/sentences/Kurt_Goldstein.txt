self actualization essential component maslow's hierarchy needs differed goldstein's original concept
maslow described self actualization realizing one's full potential seeking personal growth
maslow felt self actualization met other needs satisfied first
holistic approach goldstein's holistic approach described book organism
rather looking certain phenomena such patellar reflex singular events goldstein tried understand them components holistic organism
although believed possible reflexes exist themselves goldstein's approach postulated exist concurrence another process body
while hitting kneecap rubber hammer testing pupillary response might seem like simple example isolated reflex goldstein argued holistic approach necessary fully understand body experiencing
excerpt organism writes examining man's pupillary reflex obtain relatively constant contraction iris possible because individual speak surrenders eye us completely foregoes usual act seeing
visual prehension environmental feature
course true real vision diameter pupil changes according amount light seen object
certainly true same light intensity will produce same contraction affects organ isolation reflex examination acts upon eye person deliberately regards objects
although easy prove experimentally needs contrast pupillary reaction man looking interestedly brightly illuminated object reaction eye exposed isolation same light intensity
difference pupillary reaction immediately manifest
greeted scientific phenomenon within organism goldstein argues humans instinctively dissect situation attempt understand better
yet doing humans miss essence intrinsic nature organism itself
rather attempting understand facets situation goldstein believes essential understand situation phenomenon arose
illustrate idea goldstein gives example person first learning how ride bicycle
initially person will attempt various motions attempt succeed
while motions fail manifest success eventually individual will understand how coordinate their body respect bicycle ride
while smoothly propelled bike may signify accomplishment looking coordinated movements learner smile portray also another sign
thus looking single aspect phenomenon instead whole goldstein argues misses true nature story
methodology goldstein developed approach situation phenomenon analyzed holistically rather simply looking isolated event
first observing situation interpretations should taken whole without giving special preference towards part phenomenon
describing phenomenon attention should diverted aspect phenomenon may interest
holistic approach calls instead phenomenon described angles without bias towards part
lastly goldstein argues must consider each every phenomenon reference entire situation

work lead conclude though physical areas brain such frontal lobes subcortical ganglia may damaged psychological trauma pressing concern
conclusions schizophrenia emphasized disease protective mechanism against anxiety rather organic defect
war trauma following research german neurologist hermann oppenheim war-related trauma goldstein concerned himself understanding trauma soldiers returning duty world war
time physicians thought soldiers merely faking symptoms order receive pension after war there little research prove otherwise
goldstein team attempted look holistic perspective theorizing neural networks interconnected thus connected outside world
therefore any trauma receives war directly impact neural networks
