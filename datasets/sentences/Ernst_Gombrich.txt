thought psychology perception gombrich arrived england 1936 art history largely concerned connoisseurship
gombrich however brought up viennese culture bildung concerned wider issues cultural tradition relationship science art
latter breadth interest seen both working relationship austrian psychoanalyst art historian ernst kris concerning art caricature later books sense order 1979 information theory discussed relation patterns ornaments art classic art illusion 1960
art illusion introduced ideas 'schemata' 'making matching' 'correction' 'trial error' influenced 'conjecture refutation' popper's philosophy science
gombrich's view artist compares drawn painted trying draw/paint 'feedback loop' gradually corrects drawing/painting look like seeing
process does start scratch however
each artist inherits 'schemata designate reality force convention'
these schemata plus techniques works previous masters starting points artist begins her own process trial error
[popperian description conjecture refutation trial error] eminently applicable story visual discoveries art
our formula schema correction fact illustrates very procedure
you must starting point standard comparison begin process making matching remaking finally becomes embodied finished image
artist cannot start scratch criticise forerunners philosophical conceptions developed popper philosophy science meshed well gombrich's ideas robust explanation history art
gombrich written first major work story art 1950 ten years before art illusion
earlier book described viewing history art narrative moving 'from ancient artists knew later artists saw'
gombrich concerned individual rather mass movements famous first line story art 'there really no such thing art
there artists' saw use scientific psychological explanations key understanding how these individual artists 'saw' how built upon traditions inherited part
dialectics making matching schema correction gombrich sought ground artistic development universal truths closer those science regarded fashionable vacuous terms such 'zeitgeist' other 'abstractions'
renaissance studies gombrich's contribution study renaissance art began doctoral dissertation mannerism
argues work giulio romano palazzo del tè work decadent renaissance artist rather showed how painter responded demands patron 'eager fashionable novelty' four-volume series studies art renaissance 1966 comprises volumes norm form symbolic images heritage apelles new light old masters made major contribution study symbolism work period
