agrell continued nominating merezhkovsky up until own death 1937 making eight such nominations each year latter's chances getting slimmer
books produced latter years like compilation religious biographies faces saints jesus nowadays reformers trilogy published posthumously weren't ground-breaking
hard times deepening troubles notwithstanding merezhkovsky continued work hard till dying day trying desperately complete spanish mysteries trilogy last three pieces unfinished little theresa deathbed died literally pen hand
merezhkovsky european dictators although never nationalist merezhkovsky russo-centric author thinker cherishing idea country's unique many ways decisive place world culture history
never tiring reiterating russian plight problem world russia postulate ever look-out 'strong leader' able organize successfully see through anti-communist crusade
while merezhkovsky thought he's found hero benito mussolini having sponsored book dante several lengthy talks russian writer politics literature art
impressed merezhkovsky started see new friend incarnation dante almost
letter addressed mussolini best truest liveliest document dante — your personality
understand dante live through you being around makes possible
two souls yours merged infinity itself bringing you two together
visualize mussolini contemplation it's dante
imagine dante action it's mussolini
while merezhkovsky trying convince mussolini latter's mission start holy war against russia idea formed basis article meeting mussolini published illustrated russia february 1937
seeing name frequently mentioned italian press connection bizarre merezhkovsky's suggestions made duce uneasy took step back
visiting rome summer 1937 merezhkovsky talks italian foreign minister failed meet mussolini
then came disillusionment october same year already speaking how disappointed italian leader's petty materialism
tried contact general francisco franco now seeing spain last anti-communist citadel europe failed
thus merezhkovsky's choice new european heroes narrowed down adolf hitler
merezhkovsky never seen fascism alternative communism
early 1930 doomed europe stuck two stores explosives fascism communism expressing hope day these two evils will somehow destroy another
danger fuhrer's possible taking over europe still lesser evil possible communist expansion

speech printed version entitled bolshevism humanity believed merezhkovsky comparing hitler joan arc called anti-bolshevik crusade reiterating among other things saying through 1920 s 1930 s bolshevism will never change nature
because right start it's national international phenomenon
very first day russia remains very day means end conquering whole world
end us gippius allegedly commented disgusted horrified
days come though husband wife those knew them later attested often expressing horror news nazis' atrocities eastern front according gippius' friend poet victor mamchenko merezhkovsky far supporting hitler those days actually condemning
biographer zobnin doubts fact merezhkovsky german radio noting none memoirists mentioned themselves heard merezhkovsky speaking air
those 'witnesses' invariably referring printed version speech published 1944 parizhsky vestnik
document according zobnin author first comprehensive merezhkovsky biography published russia most certainly montage fake concocted nazi propaganda out 1939 unpublished essay mystery russian revolution dostoyevsky's demons novel bits pieces thrown
researcher insists such speech broadcast late june couple resided biarritz elderly person give everybody slip somehow get paris hardly probable
adding confusion well-documented fact merezhkovsky already made speech mentioning hitler joan arc breath

merezhkovsky's ideas merezhkovsky's first adopted philosophical trend then popular positivism
soon disillusioned idea although never rejecting wholly merezhkovsky turned religion
seeds hybrid european positivism grafted what's described subjective idealism russian orthodoxy sown field literature study brought forth brochure entitled causes decline new trends contemporary russian literature
manifesto gave burgeoning russian symbolist movement both ideology name such merezhkovsky first russia speak symbols definitive means cognizance modern art
center new train thought notion rejecting rational favour intuitive means exploiting author termed spirituality symbol seeing latter perfect means describing reality otherwise unfathomable
through symbol according merezhkovsky get object's deeper meaning whereas quoting tyutchev thought whilst being spoken turns lie poetry unspoken things flickering through beauty symbol affect us stronger what's expressed words
symbolism endows both style essence poetry spirituality poetic word becomes clear translucent walls alabaster amphora carrying flame
longing things never experienced yet looking undertones yet unknown searching out dark unconscious things our sensual world coming ideal poetry's main characteristics
three principal elements new art mystic essence symbolism expansion artist's impressiveness
dmitry merezhkovsky
according scholar
churakov merezhkovsky pronouncing death metaphysics putting forward idea language symbols adequate instrument discovering modern world's pattern meanings unwillingly following auguste comte difference being latter employing these ideas scientific fields while former proposed use them literature criticism
third testament merezhkovsky's next most fundamental step ahead self-styled modernist philosophy leader taken tandem young intellectual wife zinaida gippius first days their meeting started generating new ideas her husband develop
thus third testament theory born rather revived transplanted middle ages italian origins early 20 th century's russian ambience
third testament formed basis early 20 th-century russian new religious consciousness movement turn kick started religious-philosophical society action again gippius producing basic ideas her husband formulate
borrowing original idea joachim fiore 12 th-century theologist merezhkovskys created developed their own concept man's full-circle religious evolution
bible seen starting point god having taken two steps towards man latter respond third logically conclusive
according merezhkovsky first divine father's second divine son's testaments seen preliminary steps towards third holy ghost
first maintaining law god second grace god third testament should bring liberation human race first testament revealing god's power gospel truth second transforming gospel truth love third translating love liberation
last kingdom pronounced heard will final never before revealed name coming god liberator according author
merezhkovsky saw third testament synthesis two original revelations earth pre-christian beliefs heaven christianity
mystery holy trinity resolved should link three elements circle great new earth under new heavens promised book apocalypse
rozanov put merezhkovsky's greatest innovation attempt merge together two — christian heathen — poles poignancy
discover 'tempting vice' greatest virtues greatest virtues tempting vice
new trinity concept implied all-inviting holy ghost sexless spirit female entity
sex spirituality human history according merezhkovsky ceaseless battle two abysses abyss flesh discovered pre-christians abyss spirit opened christianity's sexless ascetism
pre-christians celebrated flesh-driven sensuality expense spirituality
ascetic christians brought rise spirit expense sex
merezhkovsky declared dialectical inevitability thesis antithesis' coming together spiritual sexual poles uniting higher celestial level
own words being aware myself my body i'm root personality
being aware myself other one's body i'm root sex
being aware myself human bodies am root unity
noticing aramaic languages translates spirit rucha female entity merezhkovsky interpreted holy trinity father son's unity higher being their common godly mother
latter's kingdom come third testament supposed lead
seeing both god man intrinsically unisexual merezhkovsky regarded male/female schism symptom imperfection cause primal human being's fatal disintegration
modern times according merezhkovsky both monastic ascetic christianity will cease exist
art just adopt religious forms become integral part religion latter taken broader concept
human evolution saw lead merging whatever polarized sex spirit religion culture male female et cetera — bringing kingdom come 'out there' 'here earth'
merezhkovsky religious anarchism man's evolutional progress towards third testament kingdom come won't without revolutionary upheavals according merezhkovsky will strewn catastrophes most them dealing revolution spirit
consequence such revolution bring gradual change nature religion itself latter taking under spacious wing man's sensual liberation also latter's freedom rebellion
human long we're rebels merezhkovsky insisted expressing saw proto-existentialist idea
result revolution spirit should severing ties state religion according merezhkovsky
church old new eternal universal opposite idea state absolute truth opposing absolute lie declared open letter berdyaev
rozental analyzing merezhkovsky's political religious philosophy thus summed up writer's position law amounts violence
difference legitimate power holds violence 'in reserve' violence itself matter degree sinful both
autocracy murder nothing two extreme forms exhibiting [criminal] power
interpreting biblical version human history sequence revolutionary events merezhkovsky saw religion revolution inseparable
just social revolution succeed spiritual revolution should come step ahead
russia lack latter brought former's fiasco antichrist taking hold things argued
1920 s merezhkovsky lost interest religious anarchism doctrine
later years became close ecumenical ideals prophesying kingdom come synthesis peter paul john's principles bringing catholic protestant eastern orthodox traditions together
legacy throughout lifetime dmitry merezhkovsky polarized opinion native russia bringing upon himself both praise scorn occasionally same quarters
according yevgeny yevtushenko merezhkovsky became russia's first ever new-type universal kind dissident managed upset just everybody thought themselves responsible guarding morality order tsarist government saw merezhkovsky subverting state foundations patriarchs official orthodoxy regarded heretic literary academia decadent futurists retrograde lev trotsky ardent global revolution ideologist reactionary
sympathetic anton chekhov's words came went unnoticed 'a believer believer apostolic kind'
words modern biographer will find place history alongside marquis de sade nietzsche henry miller those classics through being condemned ostracized many approached appreciated few
disliked scolded russia loved praised abroad misunderstood both here there merezhkovsky letter nikolai berdyaev
merezhkovsky given credit exceptional erudition scientific approach writing literary gift stylistic originality
seen retrospect first ever arguably russian cabinet writer european type merezhkovsky according berdyayev best-educated people saint petersburg first quarter 20 th century
korney chukovsky pondering dire state early 20 th century russia's cultural elite admitted most cultured them mysterious unfathomable almost mythical creature merezhkovsky
anton chekov insisted russian academy sciences should appoint merezhkovsky honorary academic early 1902
merezhkovsky first russia formulate basic principles symbolism modernism opposed 'decadence' tag battling
never aspiring leading role movement soon became according
koretskaya kind handy encyclopedia ideology symbolism others borrow aesthetic socio-historical even moral ideas

thomas mann merezhkovsky genius critic specialist world psychology second nietzche
notable other germans influenced merezhkovsky included arthur moeller van den bruck alfred rosenberg later researchers noted merezhkovsky's willingness question dogmas thwart tradition disregard public opinion never shying controversy even scandal
crucial context according o
dafier quest ways overcoming deep crisis came result russian traditionalist church losing credibility
criticism russia general response merezhkovsky's literary cultural social activities negative
prose even face stylistically flawless occasionally accessible critics argued elitist thing unto itself hermetically closed uninitiated majority
having isolated himself real life merezhkovsky built up inner temple own personal use
me-and-culture me-and-eternity those recurring themes 1911 leon trotsky
scientifically strict academic approach process collecting re-processing material contemporary academia little exception ridiculed merezhkovsky dismissing gifted charlatan bent rewriting history accordance own current ideological philosophical whims
due incorrigible many saw tendency towards inconsistency merezhkovsky's old allies deserting while new ones approached warily
vasily rozanov 1909 merezhkovsky thing ceaselessly speaks jacket trousers combination producing torrent noise
clear grounds speaking activity once three years undergoes total change mental wardrobe following three years busies himself defying things maintaining previously
another former friend minsky questioned merezhkovsky's credibility critic finding biographies tendency see subjects things wanted see skillfully re-moulding questions instant answers
religiosity merezhkovsky never popular either russian orthodox church officials religious intellectual elite time people like sergey bulgakov pavel florensky lev shestov fiercely denouncing ideas projects
similarly reputation radical social democrat hasn't made merezhkovsky popular leftist literary camp
variously described anti-literature phenomenon viktor shklovsky greatest corpse russian literature ivanov-razumnik book-worm totally foreign things human korney chukovsky
writer's work published emigration according 1934 soviet literary encyclopedia telling example ideological degradation cultural degeneration white emigres
