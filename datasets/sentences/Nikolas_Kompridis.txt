while drawing many habermas' own insights along philosophical traditions german idealism american pragmatism work many others kompridis proposes alternative approach social criticism sees role facilitating social change

today plea recovery trust future gained unexpectedly broad resonance… book way signals end period marked divergent even opposite tendencies hand postmodern fascination extraordinary rupture rapture other streamlining critical theory mold rule-governed rationalist normalcy
james swindal suggests kompridis taken recent work habermas' fully account nonetheless book needed written because habermas’s critique disclosure times narrow short-sighted
habermas now rethinking these shortcomings kompridis gives indeed critical theorists ample resources better balance disclosure procedural thinking
similarly dana villa writes kompridis argues—persuasively think— contemporary critical theory well abandon insistence communicative rationality quasi-transcendental core democratic legitimacy rethink suspicion world disclosure

talk kompridis outlined potential dangers saw new convergent techno-sciences genetic engineering synthetic biology robotics nanotechnology while criticizing considered transhumanist aspirations several major research programs those fields
according kompridis post-human now real notional… possibility therefore question means human sudden pressing question question absolutely pressed time—since evidently space still meaningfully posed thus space meaningful response fashioned shrinking alarming rate
while acknowledging culturally plural world there no single essentialist conception means human kompridis nonetheless argues obligation deepen our understanding actually threatened new technologies
otherwise question means human will permanently foreclosed human beings because will already decided scientific experts market forces certain tendency our liberal culture favour anything increases freedom choice individuals
kompridis therefore proposes inter-disciplinary counter science human provide alternatives naturalistic assumptions identity predominate natural sciences work concert wider culture individualism erode preclude other understandings means human
counter science take two main starting points concept person underpinned consciousness definition based things human beings care peculiarly human ways phenomenon intercorporeality way human beings develop ability learn act make sense things under conditions embodiment social context

exchange seyla benhabib 2006 kompridis participated exchange critical theorist seyla benhabib journal political theory
kompridis criticized benhabib's book claims culture arguing she promotes deeply problematic concept hybridity
view commits her applying double-standard respect endangered marginal cultural traditions larger liberal capitalist societies leaving minority cultures disadvantage vulnerable assimilation
benhabib denied writing [c]ultures subject decentering reflexivity pluralization regenerate within themselves novel semantic resources resistance assimilation
response published same issue political theory benhabib's reply kompridis writes demands too little modern democracies puts too great burden minority cultures how curious benhabib firmly opposed freezing cultural differences yet firmly favour freezing constitutional principles
seems hybridity very much welcome confined domain culture… [but] complex cultural dialogue should defensive should asymmetrically distribute risk decentering reflexivity openness change either minorities majorities democratic politics constitutional principles
counter benhabib's argument cultural hybridity kompridis suggests starting instead view cultures both identical non-identical themselves
benhabib started position suggests she approached questions cultural preservation very differently open-mindedly
problem cultural preservation doesn’t presented easily rejected demanding right 'freeze' existing cultural differences… presented instead matter fairly sensitively enabling free interplay identical non-identical culture itself
