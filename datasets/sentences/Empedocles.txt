empedocles continued tradition helping overthrow succeeding oligarchic government
magnanimous support poor severe persecuting overbearing conduct oligarchs even declined sovereignty city offered

contemporary life empedocles xanthus lost
works piece strasbourg empedocles papyrus bibliothèque nationale et universitaire strasbourg empedocles considered last greek philosopher write verse surviving fragments teaching two poems purifications nature
empedocles undoubtedly acquainted didactic poems xenophanes parmenides allusions latter found fragments seems surpassed them animation richness style clearness descriptions diction
aristotle called father rhetoric although acknowledged meter point comparison poems empedocles epics homer described empedocles homeric powerful diction
lucretius speaks enthusiasm evidently viewed model
two poems together comprised 5000 lines
550 lines poetry survive although because ancient writers rarely mentioned poem quoting certain poem quotes belong
scholars now believe there poem purifications merely formed beginning nature
purifications possess 100 lines purifications
seems given mythical account world may nevertheless part empedocles' philosophical system
first lines poem preserved diogenes laërtius friends inhabit mighty town tawny acragas crowns citadel caring good deeds greetings immortal god no longer mortal wander among you honoured adorned holy diadems blooming garlands
whatever illustrious towns go am praised men women accompanied thousands thirst deliverance ask prophecies entreat remedies against kinds disease
probably work contained story souls there once spirits lived state bliss having committed crime nature unknown punished being forced become mortal beings reincarnated body body
humans animals even plants such spirits
moral conduct recommended poem may allow us become like gods again
nature there 450 lines poem nature extant including 70 lines reconstructed papyrus scraps known strasbourg papyrus
poem originally consisted 2000 lines hexameter verse addressed pausanias
poem outlined philosophical system
empedocles explains nature history universe including theory four classical elements describes theories causation perception thought well explanations terrestrial phenomena biological processes
philosophy empedocles portrayed nuremberg chronicle although acquainted theories eleatics pythagoreans empedocles belong any definite school
eclectic thinking combined much suggested parmenides pythagoras ionian schools
firm believer orphic mysteries well scientific thinker precursor physical science
aristotle mentions empedocles among ionic philosophers places very close relation atomist philosophers anaxagoras
according house 1956 another fragments dialogue poets aristotle treats fully poetics ch
empedocles though clearly implying poet aristotle there says homeric artist language skilled metaphor other devices poetry
empedocles like ionian philosophers atomists continued tradition tragic thought tried find basis relationship many
each various philosophers following parmenides derived eleatics conviction existence pass non-existence vice versa
yet each peculiar way describing relation divine mortal thought thus relation many
order account change world accordance ontological requirements eleatics viewed changes result mixture separation unalterable fundamental realities
empedocles held four elements water air earth fire those unchangeable fundamental realities themselves transfigured successive worlds powers love strife heraclitus explicated logos unity opposites
four elements empedocles established four ultimate elements make structures world—fire air water earth
empedocles called these four elements roots also identified mythical names zeus hera nestis aidoneus e
now hear fourfold roots everything enlivening hera hades shining zeus
nestis moistening mortal springs tears
empedocles never used term element greek στοιχεῖον stoicheion seems first used plato
according different proportions these four indestructible unchangeable elements combined each other difference structure produced
aggregation segregation elements thus arising empedocles like atomists found real process corresponds popularly termed growth increase decrease
nothing new comes come being change occur change juxtaposition element element
theory four elements became standard dogma next two thousand years
love strife confused greek deities love strife
empedocles cosmic cycle based conflict love strife four elements however simple eternal unalterable change consequence their mixture separation also necessary suppose existence moving powers bring mixture separation
four elements both eternally brought union parted another two divine powers love strife
love φιλότης responsible attraction different forms matter strife νεῖκος cause their separation
these elements make up universe then love strife explain their variation harmony
love strife attractive repulsive forces respectively plainly observable human behavior also pervade universe
two forces wax wane their dominance neither force ever wholly disappears imposition other
sphere empedocles best original state there time pure elements two powers co-existed condition rest inertness form sphere
elements existed together their purity without mixture separation uniting power love predominated sphere separating power strife guarded extreme edges sphere
since time strife gained sway bond kept pure elementary substances together sphere dissolved
elements became world phenomena see today full contrasts oppositions operated both love strife
sphere being embodiment pure existence embodiment representative god
empedocles assumed cyclical universe whereby elements return prepare formation sphere next period universe
cosmogony since time sphere strife gained sway actual world full contrasts oppositions due combined action both principles
empedocles attempted explain separation elements formation earth sea sun moon atmosphere
also dealt first origin plants animals physiology humans
elements entered combinations there appeared strange results heads without necks arms without shoulders
then these fragmentary structures met there seen horned heads human bodies bodies oxen human heads figures double sex
most these products natural forces disappeared suddenly arose those rare cases parts found adapted each other complex structures last
thus organic universe sprang spontaneous aggregations suited each other intended
soon various influences reduced creatures double sex male female world replenished organic life
possible see theory anticipation darwin's theory natural selection although empedocles trying explain evolution
perception knowledge empedocles credited first comprehensive theory light vision
put forward idea see objects because light streams out our eyes touches them
while flawed hindsight became fundamental basis later greek philosophers mathematicians such euclid construct most important theories light vision optics
knowledge explained principle elements things outside us perceived corresponding elements ourselves
like known like
whole body full pores hence respiration takes place over whole frame
organs sense these pores specially adapted receive effluences continually rising bodies around us way perception explained
thus vision certain particles go forth eye meet similar particles given forth object resultant contact constitutes vision
perception merely passive reflection external objects
empedocles noted limitation narrowness human perceptions
see part fancy grasped whole
senses cannot lead truth thought reflection must look thing every side
business philosopher while laying bare fundamental difference elements display identity exists seem unconnected parts universe
respiration famous fragment empedocles attempted explain phenomena respiration means elaborate analogy clepsydra water clock ancient device transmitting liquids vessel another
fragment sometimes connected passage aristotle's physics aristotle refers people twisted wineskins captured air clepsydras demonstrate void does exist
there however no evidence empedocles performed any experiment clepsydras
fragment certainly implies empedocles knew corporeality air says nothing whatever void
clepsydra common utensil everyone used must known sense invisible air resist liquid
reincarnation like pythagoras empedocles believed transmigration soul souls reincarnated humans animals even plants
empedocles living things same spiritual plane plants animals links chain humans link too
empedocles urged vegetarian lifestyle since bodies animals dwelling places punished souls
wise people learned secret life next divine their souls free cycle reincarnations able rest happiness eternity
