lippmann argued diplomacy should basis relations soviets suggested u
withdraw forces europe reunify demilitarize germany
meanwhile soon revealed informally x indeed kennan
information seemed give x article status official document expressing truman administration's new policy toward moscow
kennan intended x article prescription policy
rest life kennan continued reiterate article imply automatic commitment resist soviet expansionism wherever occurred little distinction primary secondary interests
article make obvious kennan favored employing political economic rather military methods chief agent containment
my thoughts containment kennan 1996 interview cnn course distorted people understood pursued exclusively military concept think much any other cause led [the] 40 years unnecessary fearfully expensive disoriented process cold war
additionally administration made few attempts explain distinction soviet influence international communism u
part failure reflected belief many washington writes historian john lewis gaddis prospect undifferentiated global threat shake americans out their isolationist tendencies remained latent among them
pbs television interview david gergen during 1996 kennan again reiterated regard soviets primarily military threat noting like hitler

after long telegram recalled later my official loneliness came fact end
my reputation made
my voice now carried
influence under marshall april 1947 december 1948 george c
marshall secretary state kennan influential any other period career
marshall valued strategic sense create direct now named policy planning staff state department's internal think tank
kennan became first director policy planning
marshall relied heavily prepare policy recommendations
kennan played central role drafting marshall plan
although kennan regarded soviet union too weak risk war nonetheless considered enemy capable expanding western europe through subversion given popular support communist parties western europe remained demoralized devastation second world war
counter potential source soviet influence kennan's solution direct economic aid covert political help japan western europe revive western governments assist international capitalism doing united states help rebuild balance power
during june 1948 kennan proposed covert assistance left-wing parties oriented toward moscow labor unions western europe order engineer rift moscow working-class movements western europe
united states initiating marshall plan kennan truman administration hoped soviet union's rejection marshall aid strain relations communist allies eastern europe
kennan initiated series efforts exploit schism soviets josip broz tito's yugoslavia
kennan proposed conducting covert action balkans further decrease moscow's influence
administration's new vigorously anti-soviet policy also became evident kennan's suggestion u
changed hostility francisco franco's anti-communists regime spain order secure u
influence mediterranean
kennan observed during 1947 truman doctrine implied new consideration franco
suggestion soon helped begin new phase u
–spanish relations ended military cooperation after 1950
differences acheson kennan's influence rapidly decreased dean acheson became secretary state succeeding ailing george marshall during 1949 1950
acheson regard soviet threat chiefly political saw berlin blockade starting during june 1948 first soviet test nuclear weapon during august 1949 communist revolution china month later beginning korean war during june 1950 evidence
truman acheson decided delineate western sphere influence create system alliances
policy realized nsc-68 classified report issued united states national security council during april 1950 written paul nitze kennan's successor director policy planning
kennan charles bohlen another state department expert russia argued wording nsc-68 became basis cold war policy
kennan rejected idea stalin grand design world conquest implicit nitze's report argued actually feared overextending russian power
kennan even argued nsc-68 should drafted make u
policies too rigid simplistic militaristic
acheson overruled kennan bohlen endorsing assumption soviet menace implied nsc-68
kennan opposed building hydrogen bomb rearmament germany policies encouraged assumptions nsc-68
during korean war began north korea invaded south korea during june 1950 rumors started circulating state department plans being made advance beyond 38 th parallel north korea act kennan considered dangerous engaged intense arguments assistant secretary state far east dean rusk apparently endorsed acheson's goal forcibly unite koreas
kennan lost influence acheson any case relied much less staff marshall
kennan resigned director policy planning during december 1949 stayed department counselor until june 1950
acheson replaced kennan nitze during january 1950 much comfortable calculus military power
afterwards kennan accepted appointment visitor institute advanced study fellow moderate robert oppenheimer director institute
despite influence kennan never really comfortable government
regarded himself outsider little patience critics
averell harriman u
ambassador moscow kennan deputy 1944 1946 remarked kennan man understood russia united states
ambassador soviet union during december 1951 president truman nominated kennan next united states ambassador ussr
appointment endorsed strongly senate
many respects kennan's consternation priorities administration emphasized creating alliances against soviets negotiating differences them
memoirs kennan recalled far see expecting able gain our objectives
without making any concessions though 'if really all-powerful hope get away
very much doubted case
moscow kennan found atmosphere even regimented previous trips police guards following everywhere discouraging contact soviet citizens
time soviet propaganda charged u
preparing war kennan wholly dismiss
began ask myself whether
overmilitarization our policies statements
belief moscow war after settled inevitability matter time before unleash
during september 1952 kennan made statement cost ambassadorship
answer question press conference kennan compared conditions ambassador's residence moscow those encountered while interned berlin during first few months second world war
while statement unfounded soviets interpreted implied analogy nazi germany
soviets then declared kennan persona non grata refused allow re-enter ussr
kennan acknowledged retrospectively foolish thing me
kennan eisenhower administration kennan returned washington became embroiled disagreements dwight
eisenhower's hawkish secretary state john foster dulles
even able work constructively new administration
during summer 1953 president eisenhower asked kennan manage first series top-secret teams dubbed operation solarium examining advantages disadvantages continuing truman administration's policy containment seeking roll back existing areas soviet influence
upon completion project president seemed endorse group's recommendations
lending prestige kennan's position president tacitly signaled intention formulate strategy administration within framework predecessor's despite misgivings within republican party
critical difference truman eisenhower policies containment eisenhower's concerns united states indefinitely afford great military spending
new president thus sought minimize costs acting whenever wherever soviets acted strategy designed avoid risk rather whenever wherever united states afford act
ambassador yugoslavia during john f
kennedy's 1960 presidential election campaign kennan future president offer suggestions how administration should improve country's foreign affairs
kennan needed succession
calculated steps timed such way throw adversary off balance keep off prepared sufficient privacy advantage surprise retained
also urged administration assure divergence outlook policy russians chinese accomplished improving relations soviet premier nikita khrushchev wanted distance himself communist chinese
without deceiving ourselves khrushchev's political personality without nurturing any unreal hopes concerned keep politically running encourage survival moscow tendencies personifies
additionally recommended united states work toward creating divisions within soviet bloc undermining power eastern europe encouraging independent propensities satellite governments
although kennan considered job kennedy's advisers president himself offered kennan choice ambassadorship either poland yugoslavia
kennan interested yugoslavia accepted kennedy's offer began job yugoslavia during may 1961
kennan tasked trying strengthen yugoslavia's policy against soviets encourage other states eastern bloc pursue autonomy soviets
kennan found ambassadorship belgrade much improved experiences moscow decade earlier
commented favored being surrounded group exceptionally able loyal assistants whose abilities myself admired whose judgment valued whose attitude toward myself times
enthusiastically cooperative
complain? kennan found yugoslav government treated american diplomats politely contrast way russians treated moscow
yugoslavs considered me rightly wrongly distinguished person u
pleased someone whose name heard before being sent belgrade
kennan found difficult perform job belgrade
president josip broz tito foreign minister koča popović began suspect kennedy adopt anti-yugoslav policy during term
tito popović considered kennedy's decision observe captive nations week indication united states assist anticommunist liberation efforts yugoslavia
tito also believed cia pentagon true directors american foreign policy
kennan attempted restore tito's confidence american foreign policy establishment efforts compromised pair diplomatic blunders bay pigs invasion u-2 spy incident
relations yugoslavia united states quickly began worsen
during september 1961 tito held conference nonaligned nations delivered speeches u
government interpreted being pro-soviet
according historian david mayers kennan argued tito's perceived pro-soviet policy fact ploy buttress khrushchev's position within politburo against hardliners opposed improving relations west against china pushing major soviet–u
policy also earned tito credit kremlin drawn upon against future chinese attacks communist credentials
while politicians government officials expressed growing concern yugoslavia's relationship soviets kennan believed country anomalous position cold war objectively suited u
kennan also believed within few years yugoslavia's example cause states eastern bloc demand social economic autonomy soviets
1962 congress passed legislation deny financial aid grants yugoslavia withdraw sale spare parts yugoslav warplanes revoke country's most favored nation status
kennan strongly protested legislation arguing result straining relations yugoslavia u
kennan came washington during summer 1962 lobby against legislation unable elicit change congress
president kennedy endorsed kennan privately remained noncommittal publicly want jeopardize slim majority support congress potentially contentious issue
–yugoslav relations getting progressively worse kennan tendered resignation ambassador during late july 1963
academic career later life during 1957 kennan invited bbc give annual reith lectures—a series six radio lectures titled russia atom west
these kennan explored history effect possible consequences relations russia west

allied intervention russia 1918–19
indignant soviet accounts vast capitalist conspiracy against world's first worker's state even mention first world war equally indignant decision intervene costly harmful
argues interventions arousing russian nationalism may ensured survival bolshevik state
realism political realism formed basis kennan's work diplomat diplomatic historian remains relevant debate over american foreign policy since 19 th century characterized shift founding fathers' realist school idealistic wilsonian school international relations
according realist tradition security based principle balance power whereas wilsonianism considered impractical realists relies morality sole determining factor statecraft
according wilsonians spread democracy abroad foreign policy important morals valid universally
during presidency bill clinton american diplomacy represented wilsonian school such degree those favor realism likened president clinton's policies social work
according kennan whose concept american diplomacy based realist approach such moralism without regard realities power national interest self-defeating will result decrease american power
historical writings memoirs kennan laments great detail failings democratic foreign policy makers those united states particular
according kennan american policymakers suddenly confronted cold war inherited little rationale rhetoric utopian expectations legalistic concept moralistic [the] demand seemed place others self-righteous degree high-mindedness rectitude
source problem force public opinion force inevitably unstable unserious subjective emotional simplistic
kennan insisted u
public united behind foreign policy goal primitive level slogans jingoistic ideological inspiration
containment during 1967 published first volume memoirs involved something other use military counterforce
never pleased policy influenced associated arms build-up cold war
memoirs kennan argued containment demand militarized u
foreign policy
counterforce implied political economic defense western europe against disruptive effect war european society
exhausted war soviet union posed no serious military threat united states allies beginning cold war rather ideological political rival
during 1960 s kennan criticized u

presidents urging u
government withdraw public advocacy democracy human rights saying tendency see ourselves center political enlightenment teachers great part rest world strikes me unthought-through vainglorious undesirable
these ideas particularly applicable u
relations china russia
kennan opposed clinton administration's war kosovo expansion nato establishment also opposed half century earlier expressing fears both policies worsen relations russia
described nato enlargement strategic blunder potentially epic proportions
kennan remained vigorous alert during last years life although arthritis using wheelchair
during later years kennan concluded general effect cold war extremism delay rather hasten great change overtook soviet union
age 98 warned unforeseen consequences waging war against iraq
warned attacking iraq amount waging second war bears no relation first war against terrorism declared efforts bush administration associate al qaeda saddam hussein pathetically unsupportive unreliable
kennan went warn anyone ever studied history american diplomacy especially military diplomacy knows you might start war certain things your mind purpose you doing end you found yourself fighting entirely different things you never thought before
other words war momentum own carries you away thoughtful intentions you get
today went iraq like president like us you know you begin

like historian john lewis gaddis miscamble concedes although kennan personally preferred political containment recommendations ultimately resulted policy directed toward strongpoint global containment
cultural views noting large-scale mexican immigration southwestern united states kennan 2002 there unmistakable evidences growing differentiation cultures respectively large southern southwestern regions country hand those northern regions
former very culture bulk population these regions will tend primarily latin-american nature rather inherited earlier american traditions
