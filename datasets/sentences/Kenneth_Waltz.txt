levels analysis waltz's initial contribution field international relations 1959 book man state war based upon dissertation classified theories causes war three categories levels analysis
waltz refers these levels analysis images uses writings classic political philosophers outline major points each image
each image given two chapters first mainly uses classical philosopher's writings describe image says cause war second usually consists waltz analyzing strengths weaknesses image
first image argues wars often caused nature particular statesmen political leaders such state leaders like napoleon human nature generally
basically consistent classical realism dominated international relations discipline time man state war waltz contest fully next book theory international politics
theories war fall under rubric waltz's second image contend wars caused domestic makeup states
prime example waltz refers lenin's theory imperialism posits main cause war rooted need capitalist states continue opening up new markets order perpetuate their economic system home
familiar example western world today notion non-democratic states because their internal composition start wars
waltz next assesses first two images being less influential general third image yet ultimately necessary understanding causes war
third image posits cause war found systemic level anarchic structure international system root cause war
context anarchy defined condition chaos disorder rather there no sovereign body governs interactions autonomous nation-states
put differently unlike domestic society citizens theoretically rely law enforcement agencies protect their persons property state invaded calls 911 cannot sure anyone will answer
similarly whereas two citizens dispute appeal courts render verdict importantly law enforcement agencies enforce court's ruling there no body above nation-states capable establishing rules laws states deciding how these apply specific cases compelling states honor court's ruling
result issue stake important enough state achieve satisfactory outcome using power impose will another states
realization any point time any state resort armed force forces each state prepared contingency
these themes fleshed out fully theory international politics title suggests lays out theory international politics whole rather narrower focus causes war
neorealism main article neorealism international relations waltz's key contribution realm political science creation neorealism structural realism calls theory international relations posits interaction sovereign states explained pressures exerted them anarchic structure international system limits constrains their choices
neorealism thus aims explain recurring patterns international relations such why relations sparta athens resembled those us soviet union important ways
waltz emphasizes repeatedly book elsewhere creating theory foreign policy aims explain behavior actions particular state specific time throughout period
sizable amount criticism waltz's balance power theory made scholars find unsatisfactory explaining foreign policy choices particular states particular areas like nuclear proliferation
waltz argues world exists state perpetual international anarchy
waltz distinguishes anarchy international environment order domestic
domestic realm actors may appeal compelled central authority 'the state' 'the government' international realm no such source order exists
anarchy international politics lack central enforcer means states must act way ensures their security above else risk falling behind
fundamental fact political life faced democracies dictatorships alike except rare cases cannot count good will others help them
must ready fend themselves
waltz's usage term anarchy led fundamental discursive transformation international relations ir scholars wrestled waltz's ideas
study finds term anarchy occurred average 6
9 times ir books prior 1979 35
5 times ir books after 1979
like most neorealists waltz accepts globalization posing new challenges states does believe states being replaced because no other non-state actor equal capabilities state
waltz suggested globalization fad 1990 s anything role state expanded functions response global transformations
neorealism waltz's response saw deficiencies classical realism
although terms sometimes used interchangeably neorealism realism number fundamental differences
main distinction two theories classical realism puts human nature urge dominate center explanation war while neorealism stakes reduced claim human nature argues instead pressures anarchy tend shape outcomes directly human nature statesmen diplomats domestic governmental preferences
waltz's theory explicitly makes clear theory international politics theory foreign policy does attempt predict specific state actions such collapse soviet union
theory explains general principles behavior govern relations states anarchic international system rather specific actions
recurring principles behavior include balancing power theory refined stephen walt modifying balance power concept balance threat entering individually competitive arms races exercising restraint proportion relative power
theory international politics 19796 waltz suggests explanation rather prediction expected good social science theory since social scientists cannot run controlled experiments give natural sciences much predictive power
