corrado vivanti saw sarpi religious reformer aspired toward ecumenical church historian diarmaid mac culloch describes sarpi having moved away dogmatic christianity
other hand 1983 david wootton made startling case sarpi scientific materialist thus likely veiled atheist hostile christianity itself whose politics looked forward secular society unrealizable own time thesis won acceptance
jaska kainulainen other hand asserts thesis sarpi atheist contradicts historical record pointing out neither sarpi's pronounced skepticism nor pessimistic view capabilities incompatible religious faith
sarpi’s writings support claim atheist fact atheistic point view systematic skepticism seen providing support religious belief because atheists’ position postulates certain knowledge god’s inexistence
case fundamental question existence god whether knowledge god obtainable reason faith
response unequivocal convinced knowledge divine matters attained sola fide explicitly claimed religious matters make judgments based reason instead based affection feeling kainulainen identifies sarpi fideist neo-stoic christian mortalist although critical church rome admired purity early church
scientific scholar sarpi notes françois viète established proficiency mathematics metaphysical treatise now lost anticipated ideas john locke
