quest schweitzer reviewed former work historical jesus back late 18 th century
showed image jesus changed times outlooks various authors gave own synopsis interpretation previous century's findings
maintained life jesus must interpreted light jesus' own convictions reflected late jewish eschatology
schweitzer writes jesus nazareth came forward publicly messiah preached ethic kingdom god founded kingdom heaven upon earth died give work final consecration never existed
figure designed rationalism endowed life liberalism clothed modern theology historical garb
image destroyed outside fallen pieces
quest historical jesus 1906 main article quest historical jesus fact christianity started jewish apocalyptic movement evidenced teachings historical jesus concerning end days
preach rise grave also ascend heaven day return judge rule over world saying no including himself knew exact time return before end generation
schweitzer verified many new testament references clearly explaining st-century christians believed imminent fulfillment promise world's ending within lifetime jesus's original followers
noted gospel mark jesus speaks tribulation coming clouds great power glory st mark states will happen generation shall pass till these things fulfilled st matthew 2434 taken place luke 2132 quest historical jesus schweitzer observes bible contradicting possibility important events never took place never take place described jesus specifically states seal up words prophecy promises listeners well high priest trial alive see return earth
blessed reads those hear words prophecy heed things written time near revelation 13
saint paul spoke last times brethren time short remaineth both wives though none corinthians 729 god hath these last days spoken unto us son hebrews 12 there standing here shall taste death till see son man coming kingdom matthew 1628 until see kingdom god come power mark 91 till see kingdom god luke 927
schweitzer continues writing quest historical jesus totally unreasonable think coming quickly near soon mean hundreds years much less thousands years future
blessed reads those hear words prophecy heed things written time near

schweitzer felt st
paul clearly believed immediacy second coming jesus stark contrast modern organized christianity
cover albert schweitzer's mysticism paul apostle mysticism paul apostle 1931 mysticism paul apostle schweitzer first distinguishes two categories mysticism primitive developed
primitive mysticism yet risen conception universal still confined naive views earthly super-earthly temporal eternal
additionally argues view union divinity brought efficacious ceremonies found even quite primitive religions
other hand developed form mysticism found greek mystery-cults popular st ce society
these included cults attis osiris mithras
developed form mysticism attained conception universal reached man reflects upon relation totality being being itself
schweitzer claims form mysticism intellectual found among brahmans buddha platonism stoicism spinoza schopenhauer hegel
next schweitzer poses question precise kind then mysticism paul? locates paul two extremes primitive mysticism developed mysticism
paul stands high above primitive mysticism due intellectual writings never speaks being god being god
instead conceives sonship god mediated effected means mystical union christ
summarizes pauline mysticism being christ rather being god
paul’s imminent eschatology background jewish eschatology causes believe kingdom god yet come christians now living time christ
christ-mysticism holds field until god-mysticism becomes possible near future
therefore schweitzer argues paul theologian does claim christians experience being-in-god
rather paul uses phrase being-in-christ illustrate how jesus mediator christian community god
additionally schweitzer explains how experience being-in-christ static partaking spiritual being christ real co-experiencing dying rising again
realistic partaking mystery jesus possible within solidarity christian community
schweitzer's major arguments mysticism paul apostle paul's mysticism marked phrase being christ gives clue whole pauline theology
rather reading justification faith main topic pauline thought most popular argument set forward martin luther schweitzer argues paul's emphasis mystical union god being christ
jaroslav pelikan forward mysticism paul apostle points out relation two doctrines quite other way around 'the doctrine redemption mentally appropriated through faith fragment comprehensive mystical redemption-doctrine paul broken off polished give particular refraction requires
paul's realism versus hellenistic symbolism schweitzer contrasts paul’s realistic dying rising christ symbolism hellenism
although paul widely influenced hellenistic thought controlled
schweitzer explains paul focused idea fellowship divine being through realistic dying rising christ rather symbolic hellenistic act becoming like christ through deification
after baptism christian continually renewed throughout her lifetime due participation dying rising christ most notably through sacraments
other hand hellenist lives store experience acquired initiation continually affected shared communal experience
another major difference paul's realism hellenistic symbolism exclusive nature former inclusive nature latter
schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes fact paul’s thought follows predestinarian lines
explains man elected thereto enter relation god
although every human being invited become christian those undergone initiation christian community through baptism share realistic dying rising christ
medicine age 30 1905 schweitzer answered call society evangelist missions paris looking medical doctor

controversy criticism schweitzer's views schweitzer considered work medical missionary africa response jesus' call become fishers men also small recompense historic guilt european colonizers describe injustice cruelties course centuries [the coloured peoples] suffered hands europeans?
record compiled happened white coloured races make book containing numbers pages reader turn over unread because their contents too horrible
schweitzer colonialism's harshest critics
sermon preached 6 january 1905 before anyone plans dedicate rest life work doctor africa our culture divides people two classes civilized men title bestowed persons classifying others human form may perish go dogs 'civilized men' care
oh 'noble' culture ours! speaks piously human dignity human rights then disregards dignity these rights countless millions treads them underfoot because live overseas because their skins different color because cannot help themselves
culture does know how hollow miserable full glib talk how common looks those follow across seas see done there culture no right speak personal dignity human rights
will enumerate crimes committed under pretext justice
people robbed native inhabitants their land made slaves them let loose scum mankind upon them
think atrocities perpetrated upon people made subservient us how systematically ruined them our alcoholic 'gifts' everything else done
decimate them then stroke pen take their land nothing left
oppression sin shame perpetrated under eye german god american god british god our states feel obliged first lay aside their claim 'christian'—then name jesus blasphemed made mockery
christianity our states blasphemed made mockery before those poor people
name jesus become curse our christianity—yours mine—has become falsehood disgrace crimes atoned very place instigated
every person committed atrocity jesus' name someone must step help jesus' name every person robbed someone must bring replacement everyone cursed someone must bless
now you speak missions let your message must make atonement terrible crimes read newspapers
must make atonement still worse ones read papers crimes shrouded silence jungle night
criticism schweitzer schweitzer nonetheless still sometimes accused being paternalistic colonialist racist attitude towards africans ways views differ many liberals other critics colonialism
instance thought gabonese independence came too early without adequate education accommodation local circumstances
edgar berman quotes schweitzer having 1960 no society go primeval directly industrial state without losing leavening time agricultural period allow
chinua achebe quoted schweitzer saying african indeed my brother my junior brother achebe criticized though achebe seems acknowledge schweitzer's use word brother european early 20 th century unusual expression human solidarity whites blacks
schweitzer likely speaking terms modern civilization class relationship man consistent later statement time speaking older younger brothers passed
discussion modernization primeval societies
later life became convinced modern civilization actually inferior same previous cultures terms morality
journalist james cameron visited lambaréné 1953 schweitzer 78 found significant flaws practices attitudes schweitzer staff
hospital suffered squalor without modern amenities schweitzer little contact local people
cameron make public seen time according recent bbc dramatisation made unusual journalistic decision withhold story resisted expressed wish employers publish exposé

comparison contemporary sir albert cook uganda training nurses midwives since 1910 s published manual midwifery local language luganda
reverence life main article reverence life schweitzer 1955 keynote schweitzer's personal philosophy considered greatest contribution mankind idea reverence life ehrfurcht vor dem leben
thought western civilization decaying because abandoned affirmation life ethical foundation
preface civilization ethics 1923 argued western philosophy descartes kant set out explain objective world expecting humanity found special meaning within
no such meaning found rational life-affirming optimism age enlightenment began evaporate
rift opened world-view material knowledge life-view understood will expressed pessimist philosophies schopenhauer onward
scientific materialism advanced herbert spencer charles darwin portrayed objective world process devoid ethics entirely expression will-to-live
schweitzer true philosophy must start most immediate comprehensive fact consciousness may formulated follows 'i am life wills live exist midst life wills live
nature form life must prey upon another
however human consciousness holds awareness sympathy will other beings live
ethical human strives escape contradiction far possible
though cannot perfect endeavour should strive will-to-live constantly renews itself both evolutionary necessity spiritual phenomenon
life love rooted same principle personal spiritual relationship universe
ethics themselves proceed need respect wish other beings exist does towards oneself
even schweitzer found many instances world religions philosophies principle denied least european middle ages indian brahminic philosophy
schweitzer mankind accept objective reality ethically neutral
then affirm new enlightenment through spiritual rationalism giving priority volition ethical will primary meaning life
mankind choose create moral structures civilization world-view must derive life-view vice versa
respect life overcoming coarser impulses hollow doctrines leads individual live service other people every living creature
contemplation will-to-life respect life others becomes highest principle defining purpose humanity
such theory schweitzer sought put practice own life
according authors schweitzer's thought specifically development reverence life influenced indian religious thought particular jain principle ahimsa non-violence albert schweitzer noted contribution indian influence book indian thought development laying down commandment kill damage greatest events spiritual history mankind
starting principle founded world life denial abstention action ancient indian thought period other respects ethics progressed very far reaches tremendous discovery ethics know no bounds
