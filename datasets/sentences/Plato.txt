several plato's dialogues socrates promulgates idea knowledge matter recollection learning observation study
maintains view somewhat own expense because many dialogues socrates complains forgetfulness
socrates often found arguing knowledge empirical comes divine insight
many middle period dialogues such phaedo republic phaedrus plato advocates belief immortality soul several dialogues end long speeches imagining afterlife
dialogue contrasts knowledge opinion perception reality nature custom body soul
several dialogues tackle questions art socrates says poetry inspired muses rational
speaks approvingly other forms divine madness drunkenness eroticism dreaming phaedrus 265 a–c yet republic wants outlaw homer's great poetry laughter well

dialogue ion suggests homer's iliad functioned ancient greek world bible does today modern christian world divinely inspired literature provide moral guidance properly interpreted
socrates company disputants something say many subjects including politics art religion science justice medicine virtue vice crime punishment pleasure pain rhetoric rhapsody human nature sexuality well love wisdom
metaphysics main article platonic realism platonism term coined scholars refer intellectual consequences denying plato's socrates often does reality material world
several dialogues most notably republic socrates inverts common man's intuition knowable real
while most people take objects their senses real anything socrates contemptuous people think something graspable hands real
theaetetus says such people eu amousoi εὖ ἄμουσοι expression means literally happily without muses theaetetus 156
other words such people live without divine inspiration gives people like access higher insights reality
socrates' idea reality unavailable those use their senses puts odds common man common sense
socrates says sees eyes blind idea most famously captured allegory cave explicitly description divided line
allegory cave begins republic 7
514 paradoxical analogy wherein socrates argues invisible world most intelligible noeton visible world horaton least knowable most obscure
socrates says republic people take sun-lit world senses good real living pitifully den evil ignorance
socrates admits few climb out den cave ignorance those terrible struggle attain heights go back down visit help other people up find themselves objects scorn ridicule
according socrates physical objects physical events shadows their ideal perfect forms exist extent instantiate perfect versions themselves
just shadows temporary inconsequential epiphenomena produced physical objects physical objects themselves fleeting phenomena caused substantial causes ideals mere instances
example socrates thinks perfect justice exists although clear own trial cheap copy
allegory cave often scholars represent plato's own epistemology metaphysics intimately connected political ideology often also plato's own people climbed out cave cast their eyes vision goodness fit rule
socrates claims enlightened men society must forced their divine contemplations compelled run city according their lofty insights
thus born idea philosopher-king wise person accepts power thrust upon people wise enough choose good master
main thesis socrates republic most wisdom masses muster wise choice ruler
theory forms main article theory forms theory forms theory ideas typically refers belief material world seems us real world image copy real world
plato's dialogues expressed socrates spoke forms formulating solution problem universals
forms according socrates archetypes abstract representations many types things properties feel see around us perceived reason greek λογική
other words socrates able recognize two worlds apparent world constantly changes unchanging unseen world forms may cause apparent
epistemology main article platonic epistemology many interpreted plato stating—even having first write—that knowledge justified true belief influential view informed future developments epistemology
interpretation partly based reading theaetetus wherein plato argues knowledge distinguished mere true belief knower having account object her true belief theaetetus 201 c–d
theory may again seen meno suggested true belief raised level knowledge bound account question why object true belief meno 97 d–98
many years later edmund gettier famously demonstrated problems justified true belief account knowledge
modern theory justified true belief knowledge gettier addresses equivalent plato's accepted scholars rejected others
plato himself also identified problems justified true belief definition theaetetus concluding justification account require knowledge differentness meaning definition knowledge circular theaetetus 210 a–b
later meno socrates uses geometrical example expound plato's view knowledge latter sense acquired recollection
socrates elicits fact concerning geometrical construction slave boy otherwise known fact due slave boy's lack education
knowledge must present socrates concludes eternal non-experiential form
other dialogues sophist statesman republic parmenides plato himself associates knowledge apprehension unchanging forms their relationships another calls expertise dialectic including through processes collection division
explicitly plato himself argues timaeus knowledge proportionate realm gained
other words derives one's account something experientially because world sense flux views therein attained will mere opinions
opinions characterized lack necessity stability
other hand derives one's account something way non-sensible forms because these forms unchanging too account derived them
apprehension forms required knowledge may taken cohere plato's theory theaetetus meno
indeed apprehension forms may base account required justification offers foundational knowledge itself needs no account thereby avoiding infinite regression
state main article republic plato papirus oxyrhynchus fragment plato's republic plato's philosophical views many societal implications especially idea ideal state government
there discrepancy early later views
most famous doctrines contained republic during middle period well laws statesman
however because plato dialogues assumed socrates often speaking plato
assumption may true cases
plato through words socrates asserts societies tripartite class structure corresponding appetite/spirit/reason structure individual soul
appetite/spirit/reason analogous castes society
productive workers — labourers carpenters plumbers masons merchants farmers ranchers etc
these correspond appetite part soul
protective warriors guardians — those adventurous strong brave armed forces
these correspond spirit part soul
governing rulers philosopher kings — those intelligent rational self-controlled love wisdom well suited make decisions community
these correspond reason part soul very few
timaeus plato locates parts soul within human body reason located head spirit top third torso appetite middle third torso down navel
according model principles athenian democracy existed day rejected few fit rule
instead rhetoric persuasion plato says reason wisdom should govern
plato puts until philosophers rule kings those now called kings leading men genuinely adequately philosophise until political power philosophy entirely coincide while many natures present pursue either exclusively forcibly prevented doing cities will no rest evils
nor think will human race
republic 473 c-d plato academy drawing after painting swedish painter carl johan wahlbom plato describes these philosopher kings those love sight truth republic 475 c supports idea analogy captain ship doctor medicine
according sailing health things everyone qualified practice nature
large part republic then addresses how educational system should set up produce these philosopher kings
however must taken account ideal city outlined republic qualified socrates ideal luxurious city examined determine how injustice justice grow city republic 372 e
according socrates true healthy city instead first outlined book ii republic 369 c–372 containing farmers craftsmen merchants wage-earners lacking guardian class philosopher-kings well delicacies such perfumed oils incense prostitutes pastries addition paintings gold ivory couches multitude occupations such poets hunters war
addition ideal city used image illuminate state one's soul will reason desires combined human body
socrates attempting make image rightly ordered human then later goes describe different kinds humans observed tyrants lovers money various kinds cities
ideal city promoted used magnify different kinds individual humans state their soul
however philosopher king image used many after plato justify their personal political beliefs
philosophic soul according socrates reason will desires united virtuous harmony
philosopher moderate love wisdom courage act according wisdom
wisdom knowledge good right relations exists
wherein concerns states rulers plato made interesting arguments
instance asks better—a bad democracy country reigned tyrant
argues better ruled bad tyrant bad democracy since here people now responsible such actions rather individual committing many bad deeds
emphasised within republic plato describes event mutiny board ship
plato suggests ship's crew line democratic rule many captain although inhibited through ailments tyrant
plato's description event parallel democracy within state inherent problems arise
according plato state made up different kinds souls will overall decline aristocracy rule best timocracy rule honorable then oligarchy rule few then democracy rule people finally tyranny rule person rule tyrant
aristocracy form government politeia advocated plato's republic
regime ruled philosopher king thus grounded wisdom reason
aristocratic state man whose nature corresponds objects plato's analyses throughout much republic opposed other four types states/men discussed later work
book viii plato states order other four imperfect societies description state's structure individual character
timocracy ruling class made up primarily those warrior-like character
description plato sparta mind
oligarchy made up society wealth criterion merit wealthy control
democracy state bears resemblance ancient athens traits such equality political opportunity freedom individual likes
democracy then degenerates tyranny conflict rich poor
characterized undisciplined society existing chaos tyrant rises popular champion leading formation private army growth oppression
unwritten doctrines main article plato's unwritten doctrines long time plato's unwritten doctrine controversial
many modern books plato seem diminish importance nevertheless first important witness mentions existence aristotle physics 209 writes true indeed account gives there [i
timaeus] participant different says so-called unwritten teachings ἄγραφα δόγματα
term ἄγραφα δόγματα literally means unwritten doctrines stands most fundamental metaphysical teaching plato disclosed orally say most trusted fellows may kept secret public
importance unwritten doctrines does seem seriously questioned before 19 th century
reason revealing everyone partially discussed phaedrus 276 c plato criticizes written transmission knowledge faulty favoring instead spoken logos knowledge just good beautiful
will earnest write them ink sowing them through pen words cannot defend themselves argument cannot teach truth effectually
same argument repeated plato's seventh letter 344 c every serious man dealing really serious subjects carefully avoids writing
same letter writes 341 c certainly declare concerning these writers claim know subjects seriously study
there does exist nor will there ever exist any treatise mine dealing therewith
such secrecy necessary order expose them unseemly degrading treatment 344
however plato once disclosed knowledge public lecture good περὶ τἀγαθοῦ good τὸ ἀγαθόν identified unity τὸ ἕν fundamental ontological principle
content lecture transmitted several witnesses
aristoxenus describes event following words each came expecting learn something things generally considered good men such wealth good health physical strength altogether kind wonderful happiness
mathematical demonstrations came including numbers geometrical figures astronomy finally statement good seemed them imagine utterly unexpected strange hence belittled matter while others rejected
simplicius quotes alexander aphrodisias states according plato first principles everything including forms themselves indefinite duality ἡ ἀόριστος δυάς called large small τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν simplicius reports well might also learn speusippus xenocrates others present plato's lecture good
their account full agreement aristotle's description plato's metaphysical doctrine

these sources subsequently interpreted scholars german tübingen school interpretation such hans joachim krämer thomas
dialectic role dialectic plato's thought contested there two main interpretations type reasoning method intuition
simon blackburn adopts first saying plato's dialectic process eliciting truth means questions aimed opening out already implicitly known exposing contradictions muddles opponent's position
similar interpretation put forth louis hartz suggests elements dialectic borrowed hegel
according view opposing arguments improve upon each other prevailing opinion shaped synthesis many conflicting ideas over time
each new idea exposes flaw accepted model epistemological substance debate continually approaches truth
hartz's teleological interpretation core philosophers will ultimately exhaust available body knowledge thus reach end history
karl popper other hand claims dialectic art intuition visualising divine originals forms ideas unveiling great mystery behind common man's everyday world appearances

plato nickname adjective πλατύς platýs broad
diogenes laertius mentions three possible meanings nickname ἐγυμνάσατο δὲ παρὰ ἀρίστωνι τῷ ἀργείῳ παλαιστῇ· ἀφ' οὗ καὶ πλάτων διὰ τὴν εὐεξίαν μετωνομάσθη πρότερον ἀριστοκλῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ πάππου καλούμενος [ὄνομα] καθά φησιν ἀλέξανδρος ἐν διαδοχαῖς
ἔνιοι δὲ διὰ τὴν πλατύτητα τῆς ἑρμηνείας οὕτως ὀνομασθῆναι· ἢ ὅτι πλατὺς ἦν τὸ μέτωπον ὥς φησι νεάνθης
learnt gymnastics under ariston argive wrestler
received name plato account robust figure place original name aristocles after grandfather alexander informs us successions philosophers
others affirm got name plato breadth style breadth forehead suggested neanthes
seneca mentions meaning plato's name connection moral lesson illud simul cogitemus si mundum ipsum non minus mortalem quam nos sumus providentia periculis eximit posse aliquatenus nostra quoque providentia longiorem prorogari huic corpusculo moram si voluptates quibus pars maior perit potuerimus regere et coercere
plato ipse ad senectutem se diligentia protulit
erat quidem corpus validum ac forte sortitus et illi nomen latitudo pectoris fecerat sed navigationes ac pericula multum detraxerant viribus parsimonia tamen et eorum quae aviditatem evocant modus et diligens sui tutela perduxit illum ad senectutem multis prohibentibus causis
let us same time reflect seeing providence rescues perils world itself no less mortal ourselves extent our petty bodies made tarry longer upon earth our own providence acquire ability control check those pleasures whereby greater portion mankind perishes
plato himself taking pains advanced old age
sure fortunate possessor strong sound body very name given because broad chest strength much impaired sea voyages desperate adventures
nevertheless frugal living setting limit upon rouses appetites painstaking attention himself reached advanced age spite many hindrances
grammarian apollodorus athens argues chronicles plato born first year eighty-eighth olympiad 427 bce seventh day month thargelion according tradition god apollo born day
according another biographer neanthes plato eighty-four years age death
accept neanthes' version plato younger isocrates six years therefore born second year 87 th olympiad year pericles died 429 bce
according suda plato born aegina 88 th olympiad amid preliminaries peloponnesian war lived 82 years
sir thomas browne also believes plato born 88 th olympiad
renaissance platonists celebrated plato's birth november 7
ulrich von wilamowitz-moellendorff estimates plato born diotimos archon eponymous namely july 29 428 bce july 24 427 bce
greek philologist ioannis kalitsounakis believes philosopher born may 27 427 bce while jonathan barnes regards 428 bce year plato's birth
her part debra nails asserts philosopher born 424/423 bce
according seneca plato died age 81 same day born
diogenes laertius mentions plato born according writers aegina house phidiades son thales
diogenes mentions sources universal history favorinus
according favorinus ariston plato's family family sent athens settle cleruchs colonists retaining their athenian citizenship island aegina expelled spartans after plato's birth there
nails points out however there no record any spartan expulsion athenians aegina 431–411 bce
other hand peace nicias aegina silently left under athens' control until summer 411 spartans overran island
therefore nails concludes perhaps ariston cleruch perhaps went aegina 431 perhaps plato born aegina none enables precise dating ariston's death plato's birth
aegina regarded plato's place birth suda well
