member object-oriented philosophy movement coined term object-oriented ontology 2009 distinguish positions committed thesis beings composed things graham harman's object-oriented philosophy
own version object-oriented thought called 'onticology' disprivileges human experience central position metaphysical inquiry while holding objects split two domains virtuality actuality
bryant virtuality refers powers potential any given object whereas actuality designates qualities manifested actualization object's potential any given point time
later bryant concerned doctrine withdrawal non-relationism object-oriented philosophy departed object-oriented ontology movement developed machine-oriented ontology argues being composed entirely machines processes
bryant also written extensively post-structural cultural theory including work gilles deleuze jacques lacan jacques rancière slavoj žižek

addition working professor bryant also served lacanian psychoanalyst
onticology like other object-oriented ontologists bryant opposes anthropocentrism copernican revolution proposed immanuel kant wherein objects conform mind subject turn become products human cognition
bryant's perspective kantian contention reality inaccessible human knowledge because structured human cognition limits philosophy self-reflexive analysis mechanisms institutions through cognition structures reality
states effect copernican revolution will reduce philosophical investigation interrogation single relation human-world gap
indeed reduction philosophy interrogation single relation gap will there excessive focus how humans relate world detriment anything else interrogation will profoundly asymmetrical
world object related through agency human will becomes mere prop vehicle human cognition language intentions without contributing anything own
counter form post-kantian epistemology bryant articulates object-oriented philosophy called 'onticology' grounded three principles
first ontic principle states there no difference does make difference
following premises questions difference precede epistemological interrogation produce differences principle posits knowledge cannot fixed prior engagement difference
consequently bryant thesis things-in-themselves exist outside boundaries knowledge untenable because presupposes forms being make no differences
similarly concepts difference predicated upon negation—that objects lack placed comparison another—are dismissed arising perspective consciousness rather ontological difference affirms independent being
second principle inhuman asserts concept difference producing difference restricted human sociocultural epistemological domains thereby marking being difference independent knowledge consciousness
humans exist difference-making beings among other difference-making beings therefore without holding any special position respect other differences
third ontological principle maintains there no difference does also make difference then making difference minimal condition existence being
bryant's words difference made then being
bryant further contends differences produced object inter-ontic made respect another object intra-ontic pertaining internal constitution object
since onticology construes anything produces differences—including fictions signs animals plants—as being equally real albeit different scales manuel delanda called flat ontology
within onticological framework objects composed differences coalescing system reproduces itself through time
changes identity object changes substance defined bryant particular state attained difference however shifts qualities belonging substance
qualities actualization object's inhered capacities abilities known object's powers
actualization object's power qualities properties specific place time called local manifestation
importantly occurrence local manifestations does require observation
way qualities comprise actuality referring actualization object's potential particular spatiotemporal location among multitude material differences whereas powers constitute virtuality potential retained object across time
objects distinct local manifestations another referred withdrawal their being defined relations forming their internal structure endo-relations retained powers
withdrawn being known virtual proper being object denotes enduring unified substantiality
relations external object exo-relations consistently induce same local manifestations extent actualization qualities tends toward stability example sky remaining blue because constancy rayleigh scattering atmospheric particles set relations forms regime attraction
onticology distinguishes four different types objects bright objects dim objects dark objects rogue objects
bright objects objects strongly manifest themselves heavily impact other objects such ubiquity cell phones high-tech cultures
dim objects lightly manifest themselves assemblage objects example neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects
dark objects objects completely withdrawn produce no local manifestations affect any other objects
rogue objects chained any given assemblage objects instead wander out assemblages modifying relations within assemblages enter
political protestors exemplify rogue objects breaking norms relations dominant political assemblage order forge new relations challenge change cast off prior assemblage
additionally bryant proposed concept 'wilderness ontology' explain philosophical pluralization agency away human privilege
bryant wilderness ontology alludes being being common essence characteristic entities their relations another
resisting traditional notion wilderness views civilization inside world social relations language norms separate wilderness outside world plants animals nature wilderness ontology argues wilderness contains forms being including civilization
accordingly practice wilderness ontology involves experiencing oneself being amongst rather above other beings
generalizing agential alterity being foundational ontological principle bryant posits three theses first wilderness ontology signals absence ontological hierarchy such forms being exist equal footing another
second wilderness ontology rejects topological bifurcation nature culture discrete domains instead holding cultural assemblages possible set relations nonhuman entities may enter wilderness
third wilderness ontology extends agency entities human nonhuman rather casting nonhuman entities passive recipients human meaning projection
employing these theses bryant pluralizes agential being beyond human finitude contending doing intentionality nonhuman world may investigated without reference human intent
