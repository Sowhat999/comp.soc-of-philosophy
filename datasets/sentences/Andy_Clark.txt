clark founding members contact collaborative research project whose aim investigate role environment plays shaping nature conscious experience
clark's papers books deal philosophy mind considered leading scientist mind extension
also written extensively connectionism robotics role nature mental representation
contents general themes clark's work 2 extended mind 3 bibliography 4 references 5 external links general themes clark's work clark’s work explores number disparate interrelated themes
many these themes run against established wisdom cognitive processing representation
according traditional computational accounts function mind understood process creating storing updating internal representations world basis other processes actions may take place
representations updated correspond environment accordance function goal-state desire system question any given time
thus example learning new route through maze-like building mirrored change representation building
action view outcome process determines best way achieve goal-state desire based current representations
such determinative process may purview cartesian central executive distributed process like homuncular decomposition
contrast traditional models cognition often posit one-way flow sensory information periphery towards remote areas brain clark suggested two-way cascade cortical processing underlying perception action learning
concept predictive processing lies heart view wherein top-down predictions attempt correctly guess explain away bottom-up sensory information iterative hierarchical manner
discrepancies expected signal actual signal essence prediction error travel upward help refine accuracy future predictions
interactions forward flow error conveyed error units backward flow prediction dynamic attention playing key role weighting relative influence either each level cascade dopamine mentioned possible mechanism encoding precision regard error units
action action-oriented predictive processing also plays important role clark's account another means brain reduce prediction error directly influencing environment
adds personal affective hedonic factors implicated along minimization prediction error creating nuanced model relationship action perception
according clark computational model forms philosophical foundation artificial intelligence engenders several intractable problems
salient information bottleneck order determine appropriate actions job mind construct detailed inner representations external world then world constantly changing demands mental system will almost certainly preclude any action taking place
clark need relatively little information world before may act effectively upon
tend susceptible grand illusion our impressions richly detailed world obscures reality minimal environmental information quick action
needn't try reconstruct detail world able serve own best model extract information just time
extended mind clark perhaps most well known defence extended mind hypothesis
according clark dynamic loops through mind world interact merely instrumental cycle activity runs brain through body world back again constitutes cognition
mind account restricted biological organism extends organism's environment
example carrying out mathematical task
person may complete task solely their head while another completes task assistance paper pencil
clark’s parity principle there no reason count these means different long results same
process cognition second case involves paper pencil conception mind appropriate person involved must include these items
clark concedes practice criterion equal efficiency[citation needed] required parity principle seldom met
nonetheless proposes boundary skin skull arbitrary cognitively meaningless
example above paper pencil used second person becomes virtual paper-and-pencil visible monitor controlled silicon chip implanted head similarity two situations becomes clearer
clark foresees development cognitive prosthetics electronic brain enhancements ebes only[citation needed] next logical step human mind’s natural integration technology
clark’s research interests also include wetwiring other human-electronic integration experiments well technological advances immediate human communication their utilization society
