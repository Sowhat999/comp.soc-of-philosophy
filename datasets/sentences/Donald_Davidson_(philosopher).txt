davidson known charismatic personality depth difficulty thought
work exerted considerable influence many areas philosophy 1960 s onward particularly philosophy mind philosophy language action theory
while davidson analytic philosopher most influence lies tradition work attracted attention continental philosophy well particularly literary theory related areas
although published mostly form short terse essays explicitly rely any overriding theory work nonetheless noted highly unified character—the same methods ideas brought bear host apparently unrelated problems—and synthesizing work great number other philosophers
developed influential truth-conditional semantics attacked idea mental events governed strict psychological laws rejected conception linguistic understanding having conventions rules concluding famously there no such thing language language anything like many philosophers linguists supposed
there therefore no such thing learned mastered born
philosophical work whole concerned how human beings communicate interact each other

during 1950 s davidson worked patrick suppes developing experimental approach decision theory
concluded possible isolate subject's beliefs preferences independently another meaning there multiple ways analyze person's actions terms wanted trying valued

work actions reasons causes davidson's most noted work began 1963 essay actions reasons causes attempted refute prevailing orthodox view widely attributed wittgenstein already present tolstoy's war peace agent's reasons acting cannot causes action malpas 2005 §2
instead davidson argued rationalization providing reasons explain agent's actions species ordinary causal explanation 1963 p
particular action explained davidson called primary reason involves pro-attitude roughly desire toward goal g instrumental belief performing action means attaining g
example someone's primary reason taking umbrella her outside rainy day might she wants stay dry believes taking umbrella means stay dry today
view largely conforms common-sense folk psychology held part ground while causal laws must strict deterministic explanation terms reasons need
davidson argued fact expression reason precise mean having reason itself state capable causally influencing behavior
several other essays pursue consequences view elaborate davidson's theory actions
mental events mental events 1970 davidson advanced form token identity theory mind token mental events identical token physical events
previous difficulty such view seem feasible provide laws relating mental states—for example believing sky blue wanting hamburger—to physical states such patterns neural activity brain
davidson argued such reduction necessary token identity thesis possible each individual mental event just corresponding physical event without there being laws relating types opposed tokens mental events types physical events
davidson argued fact such reduction does entail mind anything brain
hence davidson called position anomalous monism monism because claims thing issue questions mental physical events anomalous a- omalos regular because mental physical event types connected strict laws laws without exceptions
davidson argued anomalous monism follows three plausible theses
first assumes denial epiphenomenalism—that denial view mental events cause physical events
second assumes nomological view causation according event causes another there strict exceptionless law governing relation events
third assumes principle anomalism mental according there no strict laws govern relationship mental event types physical event types
these three theses davidson argued follows causal relations mental physical hold mental event tokens mental events types anomalous
ultimately secures token physicalism supervenience relation mental physical while respecting autonomy mental malpas 2005 §2
truth meaning 1967 davidson published truth meaning argued any learnable language must statable finite form even capable theoretically infinite number expressions—as may assume natural human languages least principle
stated finite way then learned through finite empirical method such way humans learn their languages
follows must possible give theoretical semantics any natural language give meanings infinite number sentences basis finite system axioms
following among others rudolf carnap introduction semantics harvard 1942 davidson also argued giving meaning sentence equivalent stating truth conditions stimulating modern work truth-conditional semantics
sum proposed must possible distinguish finite number distinct grammatical features language each them explain workings such way generate trivial obviously correct statements truth conditions infinitely many sentences making use feature
give finite theory meaning natural language test correctness generate applied language formulated sentences form 'p' true p 'snow white' true snow white
these called t-sentences davidson derives idea alfred tarski
work originally delivered john locke lectures oxford launched large endeavor many philosophers develop davidsonian semantical theories natural language
davidson himself contributed many details such theory essays quotation indirect discourse descriptions action
knowledge belief after 1970 s davidson's philosophy mind picked up influences work saul kripke hilary putnam keith donnellan whom proposed number troubling counter-examples generally described descriptivist theories content
these views roughly originate bertrand russell's theory descriptions held referent name—which object person name refers to—is determined beliefs person holds object
kripke et al
argued tenable theory fact whom person's beliefs large part entirely matter how acquired those beliefs those names how use those names traced causally their original referents current speaker
davidson picked up theory work 1980 s dealt problems relating first-person beliefs second- third-person beliefs
seems first person beliefs am hungry acquired very different ways third person beliefs someone else's belief me hungry how same content? davidson approached question connecting another how two people beliefs same external object? offers answer picture triangulation beliefs oneself beliefs other people beliefs world come existence jointly
many philosophers throughout history arguably tempted reduce two these kinds belief knowledge other descartes hume thought knowledge start self-knowledge
logical positivists say wittgenstein wilfrid sellars held start beliefs external world
arguably friedrich schelling emmanuel levinas held start beliefs other people
possible davidson's view person these three kinds mental content anyone beliefs kinds must beliefs other two kinds
radical interpretation davidson's work well noted unity brought similar approach wide variety philosophical problems
radical interpretation hypothetical standpoint davidson regards basic investigation language mind action knowledge
radical interpretation involves imagining you placed community speaks language you understand
how you come understand language? suggestion you know theory generates theorem form 's means p' every sentence object language
language community s name sentence object language p sentence translation metalanguage theory expressed
however davidson rejects suggestion grounds sentential operator 'means that' sensitive extensions terms follow also their intensions
hence davidson replaces 'means that' connective sensitive extensions sentences since extension sentence truth value truth functional connective
davidson elects biconditional—if if—as connective needed theory meaning
concludes theory meaning must such each sentence object language generates theorem form 's true p'
theory truth language serve theory meaning
significance conclusion allows davidson draw work alfred tarski giving nature theory meaning
tarski showed how give compositional theory truth artificial languages
thus davidson takes three questions central radical interpretation
firstly theory truth given natural language? secondly given evidence plausibly available radical interpreter construct verify theory truth language wish interpret? thirdly will having theory truth suffice allowing radical interpreter understand language? davidson shown using work tarski first question answered affirmatively
davidson points out beliefs meanings inseparable
person holds sentence true based believes takes sentence mean
interpreter knew person believed person held sentence true meaning sentence then inferred
vice versa interpreter knew person took sentence mean person held true belief speaker inferred
davidson doesn't allow interpreter access beliefs evidence since interpreter then begging question
instead davidson allows interpreter reasonably ascertain speaker holds sentence true without knowing anything particular belief meaning
will then allow interpreter construct hypotheses relating speaker utterance particular state affairs particular time
davidson argues because language compositional also holistic sentences based meanings words meaning word depends totality sentences appears
holistic constraint along requirement theory truth law-like suffices minimize indeterminacy just enough successful communication occur
summary then radical interpretation highlights necessary sufficient communication occur
these conditions order recognize speaker speaker their beliefs must mostly coherent correct indeterminacy meaning doesn't undermine communication must constrained just enough
conclude there no such thing language language anything like many philosophers linguists supposed
there therefore no such thing learned mastered born
must give up idea clearly defined shared structure language-users acquire then apply cases
should try again say how convention any important sense involved language think should give up attempt illuminate how communicate appeal conventions
