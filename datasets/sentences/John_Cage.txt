music see also list compositions john cage early works rhythmic structure new approaches harmony cage's first completed pieces currently lost
according composer earliest works very short pieces piano composed using complex mathematical procedures lacking sensual appeal expressive power
cage then started producing pieces improvising writing down results until richard buhlig stressed importance structure
most works early 1930 s such sonata clarinet 1933 composition 3 voices 1934 highly chromatic betray cage's interest counterpoint
around same time composer also developed type tone row technique 25-note rows
after studies schoenberg never taught dodecaphony students cage developed another tone row technique row split short motives then repeated transposed according set rules
approach first used two pieces piano c
1935 then modifications larger works such metamorphosis five songs both 1938
rhythmic proportions sonata iii sonatas interludes prepared piano soon after cage started writing percussion music music modern dance started using technique placed rhythmic structure piece foreground
imaginary landscape no
1939 there four large sections 16 17 18 19 bars each section divided four subsections first three 5 bars long
first construction metal 1939 expands concept there five sections 4 3 2 3 4 units respectively
each unit contains 16 bars divided same way 4 bars 3 bars 2 bars etc
finally musical content piece based sixteen motives
such nested proportions cage called them became regular feature music throughout 1940 s
technique elevated great complexity later pieces such sonatas interludes prepared piano 1946–48 many proportions used non-integer numbers 1¼ ¾ 1¼ ¾ 1½ 1½ sonata example flower song voice closed piano two sets proportions used simultaneously
late 1940 s cage started developing further methods breaking away traditional harmony
instance string quartet four parts 1950 cage first composed number gamuts chords fixed instrumentation
piece progresses gamut another
each instance gamut selected based whether contains note necessary melody rest notes form any directional harmony
concerto prepared piano 1950–51 used system charts durations dynamics melodies etc
cage choose using simple geometric patterns
last movement concerto step towards using chance procedures cage adopted soon afterwards
chance ching divination involves obtaining hexagram random generation such tossing coins then reading chapter associated hexagram
chart system also used along nested proportions large piano work music changes 1951 here material selected charts using ching
cage's music since 1951 composed using chance procedures most commonly using ching
example works music piano based paper imperfections imperfections themselves provided pitches coin tosses ching hexagram numbers used determine accidentals clefs playing techniques
whole series works created applying chance operations
ching star charts atlas eclipticalis 1961–62 series etudes etudes australes 1974–75 freeman etudes 1977–90 etudes boreales 1978
cage's etudes extremely difficult perform characteristic dictated cage's social political views difficulty ensure performance show impossible impossible—this being cage's answer notion solving world's political social problems impossible
cage described himself anarchist influenced henry david thoreau
[n 5] another series works applied chance procedures per-existing music other composers cheap imitation 1969 based erik satie harmony maine 1978 based belcher hymns variations 1979
these works cage borrow rhythmic structure originals fill pitches determined through chance procedures just replace originals' pitches
yet another series works so-called number pieces completed during last five years composer's life make use time brackets score consists short fragments indications start end them e
anywhere 1′15″ 1′45″ anywhere 2′00″ 2′30″
cage's method using ching far simple randomization
procedures varied composition composition usually complex
example case cheap imitation exact questions asked ching these seven modes take modes seven scales beginning white notes remaining white notes those am using? twelve possible chromatic transpositions am using? phrase transposition mode will apply note am using seven imitate note satie wrote? another example late music cage etudes australes compositional procedure involved placing transparent strip star chart identifying pitches chart transferring them paper then asking ching these pitches remain single should become parts aggregates chords aggregates selected table 550 possible aggregates compiled beforehand
finally cage's works particularly those completed during 1960 s feature instructions performer rather fully notated music
score variations 1958 presents performer six transparent squares points various sizes five five intersecting lines
performer combines squares uses lines points coordinate system lines axes various characteristics sounds such lowest frequency simplest overtone structure etc
cage's graphic scores e
concert piano orchestra fontana mix both 1958 present performer similar difficulties
still other works same period consist just text instructions
score 0'00 1962 also known 4'33 no
2 consists single sentence situation provided maximum amplification perform disciplined action
first performance cage write sentence
musicircus 1967 simply invites performers assemble play together
first musicircus featured multiple performers groups large space commence stop playing two particular time periods instructions play individually groups within these two periods
result mass superimposition many different musics top another determined chance distribution producing event specifically theatric feel
many musicircuses subsequently held continue occur even after cage's death
english national opera became first opera company hold cage musicircus 3 march london coliseum
eno's musicircus featured artists including led zeppelin bassist john paul jones composer michael finnissy alongside eno music director edward gardner eno community choir eno opera works singers collective professional amateur talents performing bars front house london's coliseum opera house
concept circus remain important cage throughout life featured strongly such pieces roaratorio irish circus finnegans wake 1979 many-tiered rendering sound both text writing second time through finnegans wake traditional musical field recordings made around ireland
piece based james joyce's famous novel finnegans wake cage's favorite books derived texts several works
improvisation since chance procedures used cage eliminate composer's performer's likes dislikes music cage disliked concept improvisation inevitably linked performer's preferences
number works beginning 1970 s found ways incorporate improvisation
child tree 1975 branches 1976 performers asked use certain species plants instruments example cactus
structure pieces determined through chance their choices musical output performers no knowledge instruments
inlets 1977 performers play large water-filled conch shells carefully tipping shell several times possible achieve bubble forming inside produced sound
