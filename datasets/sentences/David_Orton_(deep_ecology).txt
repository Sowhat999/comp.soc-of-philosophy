green web–an introduction david orton
september 1979 orton then moved helga hoffmann-orton nova scotia
mid-1980 s living their one-year-old daughter karen 130-acre farm pictou county
then orton also become acquainted philosophy deep ecology begun formulating ideas eventually lead left biocentrism defines evolving theoretical tendency within deep ecology movement
1988 established website green web
researching publishing bulletins through green web notes eventually began writing left biocentric perspective
took part internet discussion group called left bio
group adopted deep ecology recognition inherent value living things supplemented left biocentric concern social justice
orton also contributed canadian dimension left-wing anti-corporate magazine
articles explored orton himself acknowledged extremely sensitive topic—relations environmental groups aboriginal peoples
while contended environmentalists needed form alliances aboriginal peoples also warned against saw uncritical endorsement aboriginal positions violated biocentric earth-first principles
pointed example aboriginal support fur industry commercial trapping well killing wolves yukon save caribou herd
orton criticized portrayal native peoples having lived complete harmony nature before coming europeans
argued aboriginal groups hunted several large animals extinction including mammoths mastodons giant bison
canada class-based industrial capitalist society imprints value system upon native communities well upon non-native environmental movement
helpful present romanticized view past contemporary indigenous reality
during years nova scotia orton took part many environmental campaigns against saw destructive practices
vigorously opposed forest clearcutting spraying slaughter seals widespread use all-terrain vehicles uranium mining installation industrial wind turbines
deep ecology judging writings orton seems attracted deep ecology partly because anti-industrial anti-capitalist orientation belief industrialism blame ecological crisis threatening earth
orton realization major environmental problems cannot resolved within industrial system distinguishes deep ecology shallow ecology
soul deep ecology belief there fundamental change consciousness humans how relate natural world
requires change human-centered ecocentric perspective meaning humans species no superior status nature
other species right exist irrespective their usefulness human species human societies
humans cannot presume dominance over non-human species see nature resource human corporate utilization
orton's experiences waging environmental campaigns nova scotia may also led adopt central principles deep ecology
province's economy heavily dependent extraction natural resources relies heavily industrial forestry
article my path left biocentrism part ii-actual issues orton writes living 30 kilometres big pulp mill smelling hydrogen sulphide emissions wind blew direction
also hear noises big forestry machines clearcutting huge areas many sprayed biocides these clearcuts also meant extensive wildlife habitat destruction blowdowns adjacent woodlots increased human recreational access significant lowering water levels river west river runs through valley
very large areas around here absolutely no forest canopy remaining
environmental vandalism direct consequence softwood pulp mill forestry orientation nova scotia intensified throughout province
on-ground reality no matter increasing use eco-rhetoric companies their government regulatory partners e
proposed model forests integrated resource management crown lands no matter increasing awareness deep ecology environmentalists forestry critiques come number people including myself
orton writes these concrete examples forest wildlife destruction form basis mobilizing activists fight pulp mill forestry fight biological chemical herbicide spraying programs
adds term pulp mill forestry encompasses pulp mills themselves well industrial practices such forest spraying clearcutting
issues interdependent need fought together
left biocentrism david orton argued mainstream deep ecology seems believe called educational fallacy namely ideas enough effect fundamental change human relationship natural world
approach fails come terms issues class power industrial capitalist society
notes first used term socialist biocentrism signal importance fighting social justice part struggle against destruction nature
however abandoned label partly because felt excluded non-socialists partly because glossed over saw anti-ecological characteristics socialism itself
orton other positions such eco-feminism eco-marxism put human concerns ahead needs natural world
ecology must primary involved peace/anti-war social justice issues
left biocentrism says you must involved social justice issues environmental activist ecology primary
new social order will respect rights species their specific habitats will based spirituality morality economy
my path left biocentrism david orton
1998 after lengthy discussion among left bio adherents orton compiled left biocentrism primer 10-point guide outlining basic tenets their left focus within deep ecology movement
among other things primer says left biocentrism believes deep ecology must applied actual environmental issues struggles no matter how socially sensitive
mentions need reducing human population considering aboriginal issues workers' struggles context philosophy puts needs natural world ahead human-centred concerns
although orton saw eight-point deep ecology platform basis unity criticized movement's ambiguity came taking positions against economic development
noted example arne næss movement's founders promoted concept sustainable development while arguing against economic philosophy zero growth
orton criticized mainstream environmental organizations such canadian environmental network accepting government money working industrial interests
saw network inhibiting emergence grass-roots controlled funded radical environmental movement canada
also criticized green parties adopting shallow ecological positions their pursuit electoral success
calling radical reduction impact industrialism natural world orton life protected mobilizing species destroying
paying attention social justice questions class corporate power entrenched self-interest necessary part human mobilization movement deep ecology world
new social order will respect rights species their specific habitats will based spirituality morality economy
