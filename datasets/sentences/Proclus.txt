january 2016 proclus's system like other neoplatonists combination platonic aristotelian stoic elements
broad outlines proclus's system agrees plotinus
however following iamblichus plutarch athens master syrianus proclus presents much elaborate universe plotinus subdividing elements plotinus's system their logically distinct parts positing these parts individual things
multiplication entities balanced monism common neoplatonists
means hand universe composed hierarchically distinct things other things part single continuous emanation power
latter perspective many distinctions found universe result divided perspective human soul needs make distinctions own thought order understand unified realities
idealist tendency taken further john scotus eriugena there double motivation found neoplatonic systems
first need account origin character things universe
second need account how know origin character things
these two aims related begin assumption know reality then ask question reality must like origin unfolding know
important element neoplatonic answer these questions reaction scepticism
response sceptical position know appearances presented our senses world plotinus placed object knowledge inside soul itself accounted interior truth through soul's kinship own productive principles
first principle neoplatonism greek hen
being proceeds
cannot itself being
being particular nature universally productive
because beyond being epekeina tes ousias phrase plato's republic 509 also beyond thought because thinking requires determinations belong being division subject object distinction thing another
reason even name isn't positive name rather most non-multiple name possible name derived our own inadequate conception simplicity first principle
causes things conferring unity form individuality them neoplatonism existence unity form tend become equivalent
causes things exist donating unity particular manner thing form dog house individual different manners example
because makes things exist giving them individuality makes them distinct separate beings neoplatonists thought also source good everything
other name good
despite appearances first principle double things double relation coming them then being oriented back towards them receive their perfection completion good
particular characteristic proclus's system elaboration level individual ones called henads before being intelligible divinity
henads exist superabundantly also beyond being stand head chains causation seirai manner give these chains their particular character
identifies them greek gods henad might apollo cause things apollonian while another might helios cause sunny things
each henad participates every other henad according character
appears multiplicity multiplicity because any henad may rightly considered center polycentric system
intellect principle produced below level henads divine intellect nous
cannot determinate nature source determinate natures produces totality determinate natures being
determination meant existence within boundaries being
most important determinate natures greatest kinds plato's sophist being same other rest motion aristotle's ten categories quantity quality etc
other words produces plato called forms forms understood first determinations things fall
produces forms through activity thinking
itself does think instead produces divine mind intellect whose thoughts themselves forms
intellect both thinking being
mind own contents object
things relate first principle both good
being intellect product
also seeks return cause thinking attempts grasp good
because simplicity one/good does allow intellect grasp intellect does generate succession perspectives around simple source
each these perspectives itself form how intellect generates itself own content
plotinus speaks generation intellect intellect's attempt return thinking also desiring
proclus systematises production through threefold movement remaining procession return mone proodos epistrophe
intellect remains means origin
proceeds means comes separate entity
returns means doesn't cut itself off source receives good identity
threefold motion used proclus structure levels system below above material reality things except those mentioned remain proceed return
proclus also gives much elaborate account intellect does plotinus
plotinus find distinction being thinking intellect
proclus keeping triadic structure remaining procession return distinguishes three moments intellect intelligible intelligible-intellectual intellectual
correspond object thought power object grasped subject thinking subject
these three divisions elaborated further intelligible moment consists three triads being eternity living being paradigm plato's timaeus
intelligible-intellectual moment also consists three triads intellectual moment hebdomad seven elements among numbered demiurge plato's timaeus also monad time before temporal things
elaboration intellect whole proclus attempting give hierarchical ordering various metaphysical elements principles other philosophers discussed containing them within single triadic logic unfolding
proclus's universe unfolds according smallest steps possible unity multiplicity
intellect emerges multiplicity allows being different another being
divine mind intellect complete grasp moments act thought
reason intellect outside time
intellect second principle also gives rise individual intellects hold various places within proclus's cosmos
terms sources intellect like taking platonic forms placing them self-thinking thought aristotle's unmoved mover
soul soul psyche produced intellect third principle neoplatonic system
mind like intellect does grasp own content
therefore soul time comes measure soul's movement object thought another
intellect tries grasp ends up producing own ideas content
soul attempts grasp intellect return ends up producing own secondary unfoldings forms intellect
soul turn produces body material world
commentary plato's timaeus proclus explains role soul principle mediating forms intellect body material world whole
soul constructed through certain proportions described mathematically timaeus allow make body divided image own arithmetical geometrical ideas
individual souls same overall structure principle soul weaker
tendency fascinated material world overpowered
point individual souls united material body
once body our passions tendency overwhelm our reason
according proclus philosophy activity liberate soul subjection bodily passions remind origin soul intellect prepare ascend higher levels while still life avoid falling immediately back new body after death
because soul's attention while inhabiting body turned far away origin intelligible world proclus thinks need make use bodily reminders our spiritual origin
agrees doctrines theurgy put forward iamblichus
theurgy possible because powers gods henads extend through their series causation even down material world
certain power-laden words acts objects soul drawn back up series speak
proclus himself devotee many religions athens considering power gods present these various approaches
proclus philosophy important because primary ways rescue soul fascination body restore station
however beyond own station soul intellect goal ultimately unification goal
higher philosophy non-discursive reason intellect pre-intellectual unity
philosophy therefore means own overcoming points soul beyond itself
