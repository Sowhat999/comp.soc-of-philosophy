according theory presented seeing knowing subject s able see object property p p ii s see iii conditions under s sees such look way now looks s unless p iv s believing conditions described iii take p
instance me see soup boiling - know seeing boiling - soup boiling me see soup conditions under see soup such look way boiling me believe soup boiling basis
dretske’s next book knowledge flow information 1981 returns topic knowledge gained via perception substantially changes theory
dretske become convinced information theory required make sense knowledge also belief
signaled change beginning new book opening preface lines “in beginning there information
word came later
information understood dretske’s sense something exists objective mind-independent feature natural world quantified
dretske offers following theory information signal r carries information s f = conditional probability s’s being f given r k given k alone less
thus red light r carry information goal s scored f probability goal scored given light red given my background knowledge world k less given just my background knowledge
theory information dretske then argued knower k know s f = k’s belief s f caused causally sustained information s f
theory knowledge thus replaced conscious appearances idea visual state observer carries information thereby minimizing appeal mysteries consciousness explaining knowledge
dretske’s work belief begins last third knowledge flow information theory changed again book followed explaining behavior 1988
there dretske claims actions causing movements mental states rather movements themselves
action thus partly mental process itself mere product mental process
meaning - content - belief explain action view content belief explain why mental state part process leads movement does
according explaining behavior belief s f brain state recruited through operant conditioning part movement-causing processes because fact recruited carry information s f
being recruited because carrying information gives thing such brain state function carrying information dretske’s view having function carrying information makes thing representation
beliefs thus mental representations contribute movement production because their contents saying p why brain state recruited cause movement form components process known acting reason
important feature dretske’s account belief although brain states recruited control action because carry information there no guarantee will continue
yet once recruited carrying information function carrying information continue function even no longer carry information
how misrepresentation enters world
dretske’s last monograph consciousness 1995’s naturalizing mind
representational theory belief desire action explaining behavior representational theory consciousness found naturalizing mind dretske aimed give full support calls “representational thesis
claim mental facts representational facts 2 representational facts facts informational functions
naturalizing mind dretske argues brain state acquires through natural selection function carrying information then mental representation suited certain provisos being state consciousness
representations get their functions through being recruited operant conditioning other hand beliefs just held explaining behavior
addition subjects tackled dretske’s book-length projects also known leading proponent along david armstrong michael tooley view laws nature relations among universals
