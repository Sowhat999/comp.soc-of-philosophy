etymological theories raphael's inspired homer mount parnassus
“homer” name unknown origin ostensibly greek
however many greek words especially names east greeks contact eastern language speakers loans approximations paraphrases foreign words
example darius greeks dārayavahuš holding firm good himself other old persian speakers
cadmus overthrown king thebes reported phoenician probably seen “easterner” hebrew/phoenician qdm east
priam perhaps luwian priya-muwa- means exceptionally courageous
many names derivation foreign language also fit partially fit derivations proto-indo-european through greek
there few rules assist linguist identifying most likely
etymologies name homeros reach beyond greek
hand may hellenized phoenician name
west conjectures phoenician prototype homer's name patronymic homeridae male progeny line homer *benê ômerîm sons speakers id est professional tale-tellers
here patronymic designate guild
greek homer homeridae singular implied single ancestor clan practicing hereditary trade
hypothetical semitic ancestors plural ben used father id- construction never designate plural father
other hand proto-indo-european etymologies also available
poet's name homophonous greek ὅμηρος hómēros hostage surety
word attic dialect word general use
vitae pseudo-herodotus plutarch relatively obscure meaning blind interpreted meaning accompanies forced follow guide
geographic specificity word typically explained presumption known mainly aeolis coast asia minor locale homer performed therefore word aeolic dialect
there no linguistic reason other usage thinking
letter eta brands word being east greek opposed west greek cretan form alpha instead
ionic attic also east greek
proclus' chrestomathia however explicitly says tuphloi called homeroi aeolians throughout pseudo-herodotus ὅμηρος hómēros synonymous standard greek τυφλός tuphlós meaning 'blind'
characterization homer blind bard begins extant literature last verse delian hymn apollo third homeric hymns later cited support notion thucydides
author hymn claims blind bard chios
claim quite different mere attribution hymn homer third party different time
claim cannot false without supposition deliberate fraud rather mere mistake
also critics long taken self-referential passage odyssey describing blind bard demodocus court phaeacian king recounts stories troy shipwrecked odysseus
despite insistence surviving sources homer blind there many serious objections blind theory
few vitae imply blind
write then illiterate incapable composition
large poem beyond capacity human memory without assistance written cues
moreover images poem very graphic blind man never experienced scenes images
answers exist objections
example john milton composed dictated paradise lost while totally blind demonstrates blind man compose epic
lord's singer tales topic epics sung modern rhapsodes shows epics size fact being composed spontaneously memorized elements modern times
problem visual cues solved homer presumed blind birth become blind point view pseudo-herodotus
latter source homer after losing sight disease embarks career wandering rhapsode impromptu composer poems public gatherings
either beginning career early assumes stage name reputedly blind man declares himself category blind prophets see inspired inner vision outer bringing sort divine glamor performance

blind meaning joins together blind man guide
other unions certainly possible provided attested
gregory nagy uses phrase phone homereusai fitting [the song] together voice found hesiod contemporary homer interpret homeros fits song together
consideration name type leaves open possibility any rhapsode conform there no biographic original named homer
west says probability 'homer' name historical greek poet imaginary ancestor homeridai such guild-names -idai -adai normally based name historical person
upholding their function rhapsodes lay-stitchers specialising recitation homeric poetry
cultural background ancient greek coast anatolia william ihne examining sources counted many 19 locations classical times claimed homer citizen including athens accepted smyrna homer’s native city insisted city colony
cause these multiple claims civic competition honor
ihne chose smyrna because vitae identify word homer aeolic smyrna aeolic background
these circumstances give precedence longest most detailed vita pseudo-herodotus sources identify smyrna originally aeolian
aeolians three major ethnic groups ancient greece other two being ionians dorians
aeolians came mainly thessaly occupying also boeotia early date after trojan war parallel occupation peloponnesus dorians
their own dialect east greek
hesiod boeotian member group substantiated aeolic phrases related name homer found works
aeolians colonized northwest coast asia minor calling their region aeolis lesbos
villages immigrated already populated descendants trojan war population
keeping lore alive according pseudo-herodotus
aeolis extended coast opposite lesbos smyrna edge ionia
aeolian league contained 12 cities including smyrna
south 12 cities dodecapolis ionian league
688 bce smyrna taken colophonians ostensibly come festival there passed ionian hands
political relevance two leagues came practical end latter half 5 th century bce most cities around aegean joined forced join delian league koine implementing hegemony athens
each city must contribute men ships money common defense force
treasury kept athens

inscriptions those times offer basis study aeolic
buck distinguished three dialects thessalian boeotian lesbian
ionian cities asia minor spoke dialect ionic
border region ionia aeolis modified include features taken aeolic creating ionic-aeolic mixture similar homeric poems
example chios member ionian league yet chian “contains few special characteristics aeolic origin
same sort admixture occur ionic-dorian border southwestern anatolia
fact lesbian acquired ionic features poetry over course time janko argues “a northward expansion ionian population speech expense aeolians
aeolic gradually assimilating ionic after 5 th century bce both began assimilate now widespread sister dialect ionic attic koine developed hellenistic period
attic began appear inscriptions ionia 4 th century bce displaced ionian 100 bce
