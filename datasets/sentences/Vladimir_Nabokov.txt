work nabokov 1960 s nabokov 1973 nabokov's first writings russian achieved greatest fame novels english language
bilingual master compared joseph conrad nabokov however disliked both comparison conrad's work
lamented critic edmund wilson am too old change conradically john updike later called itself jest genius
nabokov translated many own early works english sometimes cooperation son dmitri
trilingual upbringing profound influence artistry
nabokov himself translated russian two books originally written english conclusive evidence lolita
translation conclusive evidence made because nabokov's feeling imperfection english version
writing book noted needed translate own memories english spend lot time explaining things well known russia then decided re-write book once again first native language after made final version speak memory nabokov first wanted name speak mnemosyne
nabokov proponent individualism rejected concepts ideologies curtailed individual freedom expression such totalitarianism various forms well sigmund freud's psychoanalysis
poshlost transcribed poshlust disdained frequently mocked works
translating lolita nabokov writes imagined distant future somebody might produce russian version lolita
trained my inner telescope upon particular point distant future saw every paragraph pock-marked pitfalls lend itself hideous mistranslation
hands harmful drudge russian version lolita entirely degraded botched vulgar paraphrases blunders
decided translate myself
nabokov published under pseudonym vladimir sirin 1920 s 1940 s occasionally mask identity critics
also makes cameo appearances novels such character vivian darkbloom anagram vladimir nabokov appears both lolita ada ardor character blavdak vinomori another anagram nabokov's name king queen knave
nabokov noted complex plots clever word play daring metaphors prose style capable both parody intense lyricism
gained both fame notoriety novel lolita 1955 tells grown man's devouring passion twelve-year-old girl
other novels particularly pale fire 1962 won place among greatest novelists 20 th century
longest novel met mixed response ada 1969
devoted time composition novel any others
nabokov's fiction characterized linguistic playfulness
example short story vane sisters famous part acrostic final paragraph first letters each word spell out message beyond grave
nabokov's stature literary critic founded largely four-volume translation commentary alexander pushkin's novel verse eugene onegin published 1964
commentary ended appendix titled notes prosody developed reputation own
stemmed observation while pushkin's iambic tetrameters part russian literature fairly short two centuries clearly understood russian prosodists
other hand viewed much older english iambic tetrameters muddled poorly documented
own words forced invent simple little terminology my own explain application english verse forms indulge certain rather copious details classification before even tackling limited object these notes my translation pushkin's eugene onegin object boils down very little—in comparison forced preliminaries—namely few things non-russian student russian literature must know regard russian prosody general eugene onegin particular
nabokov's lectures cornell university collected lectures literature reveal controversial ideas concerning art
firmly believed novels should aim teach readers should merely empathise characters 'higher' aesthetic enjoyment should attained partly paying great attention details style structure
detested saw 'general ideas' novels teaching ulysses example insist students keep eye characters dublin aid map rather teaching complex irish history many critics see being essential understanding novel
2010 kitsch magazine student publication cornell published piece focused student reflections lectures also explored nabokov's long relationship playboy
nabokov's synesthesia nabokov self-described synesthete young age equated number five colour red
aspects synesthesia found several works
wife also exhibited synesthesia like her husband her mind's eye associated colours particular letters
discovered dmitri shared trait moreover colours associated letters cases blends parents' hues—which genes painting aquarelle
synesthetes letters simply associated certain colors themselves colored
nabokov frequently endowed protagonists similar gift
bend sinister krug comments perception word loyalty being like golden fork lying out sun
defense nabokov mentioned briefly how main character's father writer found unable complete novel planned write becoming lost fabricated storyline starting colors
many other subtle references made nabokov's writing traced back synesthesia
many characters distinct sensory appetite reminiscent synesthesia

improbable there no revolution russia devoted myself entirely lepidopterology never written any novels
palaeontologist essayist stephen jay gould discussed nabokov's lepidoptery essay no science without fancy no art without facts lepidoptery vladimir nabokov reprinted landed
gould notes nabokov occasionally scientific stick-in-the-mud
example nabokov never accepted genetics counting chromosomes valid way distinguish species insects relied traditional lepidopterists microscopic comparison their genitalia
harvard museum natural history now contains museum comparative zoology still possesses nabokov's genitalia cabinet author stored collection male blue butterfly genitalia
nabokov serious taxonomist according museum staff writer nancy pick author rarest rare stories behind treasures harvard museum natural history
actually quite good job distinguishing species you think different—by looking their genitalia under microscope six hours day seven days week until eyesight permanently impaired
though work taken seriously professional lepidopterists during life new genetic research supports nabokov's hypothesis group butterfly species called polyommatus blues came new world over bering strait five waves eventually reaching chile
many nabokov's fans tried ascribe literary value scientific papers gould notes
conversely others claimed scientific work enriched literary output
gould advocates third view holding other two positions examples post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy
rather assuming either side nabokov's work caused stimulated other gould proposes both stemmed nabokov's love detail contemplation symmetry
chess problems nabokov spent considerable time during exile composition chess problems
such compositions published russian émigré press poems problems 18 chess compositions speak memory problem
describes process composing constructing memoir strain mind formidable element time drops out one's consciousness
originality invention conciseness harmony complexity splendid insincerity creating chess problem similar any other art
