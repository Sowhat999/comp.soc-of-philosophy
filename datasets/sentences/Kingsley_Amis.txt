novel perceived many part angry young men movement 1950 s reacted against stultification conventional british life though amis never encouraged interpretation
amis’s other novels 1950 s early 1960 s similarly depict situations contemporary british life often drawn amis’s own experiences
uncertain feeling 1955 centres young provincial librarian again perhaps reference larkin librarian hull temptation towards adultery like here 1958 presents amis’s contemptuous view abroad followed upon own travels continent young family take girl like you 1960 steps away immediately autobiographical remains grounded concerns sex love ordinary modern life tracing courtship ultimate seduction heroine jenny bunn young schoolmaster patrick standish
