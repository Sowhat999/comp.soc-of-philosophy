gestalt psychology 1910-13 assistant psychological institute frankfurt worked fellow psychologists max wertheimer kurt koffka
koffka functioned subjects wertheimer's now-famous studies apparent movement phi phenomenon led them turn conclusions inherent nature vision
collaborated founding new holistic attitude toward psychology called gestalt theory german word whole aspects indebted earlier work stumpf köhler's teacher christian von ehrenfels whose lectures university prague wertheimer attended
introduction book task gestalt psychology carroll pratt emphasizes köhler's irritation misinterpretation famous quote whole different sum parts
though perhaps simple error made translation many lectures textbooks modern-day psychology refer gestalt theory saying whole greater sum parts
word 'different' used köhler originally stated implies whole bears no resemblance parts creating
most psychologists however understand greater mean relationship parts itself significant part whole something present other parts simply summed up
example parts car laid out floor garage make up car
factor assembly added parts become car
problem solving 1913 köhler left frankfurt island tenerife canary islands named director prussian academy sciences anthropoid research station
worked there six years during book problem solving titled mentality apes 1917
research köhler observed how chimpanzees solve problems such retrieving bananas positioned out reach
found stacked wooden crates use makeshift ladders order retrieve food
bananas placed ground outside cage used sticks lengthen reach their arms
köhler concluded chimps arrived these methods through trial-and-error american psychologist edward thorndike claimed basis animal learning through law effect rather insight having realized answer proceeded carry out way köhler's words unwaveringly purposeful
prominent findings research done apes
köhler's work mentality apes seen turning point psychology thinking
believed people underestimated influence number external conditions such higher animals
book mentality apes köhler explains inspired work chimpanzees two main reasons
first because structure their brains closely related chemistry human body brain-structure chemical nature lower apes their brain development
intrigued human traits observed everyday behaviours animal
secondly wanted study chimps gain knowledge nature intelligent acts
early stages observing chimps clear examinations should considered characteristic each member species
köhler recognized humans chimpanzees demonstrated considerable differences intellectual field
chimps demonstrated able grasp objects around them variety fashions
incorporated their everyday playing behaviours
reason necessary use experimental tests introduce chimps handle matter
book mentality apes köhler describes how apes use their hands saying large powerful flexible hands natural links himself world things attains necessary amount muscular force co-ordination earlier age human child
köhler made most observations during first six months 1914 while working mr
provided animals problems difficult impossible chimps solve
conclusions drawn experiments apes these animals exhibit insight demonstrate intelligent behaviour common humans
köhler states these findings hold true every member species
describes correlation intelligence development brain confirmed
köhler points out downfall educational psychology time experiments apes yet create test capable assessing how far mentally healthy mentally-ill children go particular situations
köhler believed studies type performed young children future research should focus these possibilities
stated lack human standards makes itself much felt should like emphasize particularly importance and- anthropoids deceive us- fruitfulness further work direction
criticism introspection book titled gestalt psychology köhler criticized concepts introspection sub-discipline psychology dominant germany throughout late 1800 s early 1900 s
stemming ideas structuralist psychologists introspection defined self-reporting conscious thoughts sensations
believed consciousness understood breaking elements down basic parts
köhler quick dismiss train thought
claimed introspectionists too subjective their methodologies test reliability their findings
example description sensing colour red made individual may same description another
introspectionists failed their inability adequately replicate particular findings
person tested sensations regarding colour red these descriptions simply shared among followers discipline
these descriptions automatically taken valid no further testing particular sensation took place
addition köhler claimed introspection focus immediate problems regarding direct human experience
believed important goal empirical science obtain objective results apply almost everyone
introspectionists according köhler consider objective experience key point their science
opinions behaviorism köhler also vocal stance against behaviourism another competing school thought north america
time behaviourism focused solely overt acts easily observable measurable
inner thoughts feelings processes occurred presentation stimulus onset behaviour considered part black box easily understood
black box described cognition today accessible therefore should discarded psychology being something unimportant
köhler criticized behaviourists' dismissal direct experience
measurable therefore contribute furthering human understanding
köhler analyzed difference overt covert behaviours
argued behaviourists focused solely overt behaviours order make inferences concerning human functioning
using background physiology köhler suggested covert behaviours such heart rate blood pressure offer additional insight how function interact environment
gestalt psychology köhler describes advancements made physiological research tools created measure covert behaviours
covert behaviours such increased heart rate provide additional insight how people interact particular stimuli
behaviourists according köhler never adequately utilized these new instruments make sound inferences human behaviour
köhler argued against idea direct experience measurable usable
drawing upon personal experience interest field physics köhler posed example two physicists observing galvanometer instrument detects measures electric current making inferences based information provides
according köhler behaviourists act similar way observing behaviours
behaviourist will observe behaviour share results leading extension these findings others field
while behaviourism denies direct experience köhler suggests behaviourists unknowingly accepting regard
just galvanometer independent physicist subject behaviourist
direct experience results observation phenomena leads results
regard felt standpoint behaviourists appears somewhat paradoxical
