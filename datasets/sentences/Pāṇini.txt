pāṇini made use technical metalanguage consisting syntax morphology lexicon
metalanguage organised according series meta-rules explicitly stated while others deduced
two fundamental principles metalanguage based non-redundancy principle economy necessity rules aṣṭādhyāyī
aṣṭādhyāyī consists 3959 sutras rules distributed among eight chapters each subdivided four sections padas pādāḥ
example words text few rules depending context discourse additional information geographical cultural historical context pāṇini discerned
rules first two sutras follows

c ṅ refer shiva sutras 4 ai au c 3 e o ṅ respectively forming known pratyāhāras comprehensive designations ai c eṅ

sutra defines technical term term defined comes end first sutra should properly ādai j vṛddhir instead vṛddhir ādai c
however order reversed good-luck word very beginning work vṛddhir happens mean 'prosperity' non-technical use
