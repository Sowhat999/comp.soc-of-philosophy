yet influence circle's thought least important any members
1926 members vienna circle wittgenstein take part many discussions
however during these discussions soon became evident wittgenstein held different attitude towards philosophy members circle whom work inspired
example during meetings vienna circle express disagreement group's misreading work turning back them reading poetry aloud
autobiography rudolf carnap describes wittgenstein thinker gave greatest inspiration
however also there striking difference wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems schlick myself
our attitude toward philosophical problems very different scientists toward their problems
wittgenstein point view attitude toward people problems even theoretical problems much similar those creative artist those scientist might almost say similar those religious prophet seer
finally sometimes after prolonged arduous effort answers came forth statement stood before us like newly created piece art divine revelation
impression made us insight came through divine inspiration help feeling any sober rational comment analysis profanation
