linguistic theory “what started purely linguistic research
led through involvement political causes identification older philosophic tradition no less attempt formulate overall theory man
roots manifest linguistic theory
discovery cognitive structures common human race humans species specific leads quite easily thinking unalienable human attributes
edward marcotte chomsky's linguistic theory within field linguistics chomsky credited inaugurating cognitive revolution
largely responsible establishing field formal natural science moving away procedural form structural linguistics dominant during mid-20 th century
such often referred father modern linguistics
basis chomsky's linguistic theory rooted biolinguistics holding principles underlying structure language biologically determined human mind hence genetically transmitted
therefore argues humans share same underlying linguistic structure irrespective sociocultural differences
adopting position chomsky rejects radical behavorist psychology
skinner views mind tabula rasa blank slate thus treats language learned behavior
accordingly argues language unique evolutionary development human species unlike modes communication used any other animal species
chomsky's nativist internalist view language part philosophical school rationalism contrasted anti-nativist externalist view language part philosophical school empiricism
universal grammar main article universal grammar [chomsky's] vision complex universe within mind governed myriad rules prohibitions yet infinite creative potential opens up vistas possibly important einstein’s theories
daniel yergin new york times magazine chomskyan approach towards linguistics studies grammar innate body knowledge possessed language users often termed universal grammar
since 1960 s chomsky maintained syntactic knowledge least partially inborn implying children need learn certain parochial features their native languages
chomsky based argument observations human language acquisition noting there enormous gap linguistic stimuli children exposed rich linguistic knowledge attain see poverty stimulus argument
example while human baby kitten both capable inductive reasoning exposed exactly same linguistic data human will acquire ability understand produce language while kitten will never acquire either ability
chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity human cat lacks language acquisition device lad suggested tasks linguistics should determine lad constraints imposes range possible human languages
universal features result these constraints constitute universal grammar ug
different grammatical surface structures sentence transformational generative grammar main article transformational generative grammar beginning syntactic structures 1957 distillation logical structure linguistic theory 1955 chomsky challenges structural linguistics introduces transformational grammar
chomsky's theory posits language consists both deep structures surface structures
surface structure 'faces out' represented spoken utterances while deep structure 'faces inward' expresses underlying relations words conceptual meaning
transformational grammar generative grammar dictates syntax word order surface structures adheres certain principles parameters consists limited series rules expressed mathematical notation transform deep structures well-formed surface structures
transformational grammar thus relates meaning sound
set inclusions described chomsky hierarchy chomsky hierarchy main article chomsky hierarchy chomsky hierarchy sometimes referred chomsky-schützenberger hierarchy containment hierarchy classes formal grammars
hierarchy imposes logical structure across different language classes provides basis understanding relationship grammars devices enumerate valid sentences within languages
order increasing expressive power includes regular type-3 grammars context-free type-2 grammars context-sensitive type-1 grammars recursively enumerable type-0 grammars
each class strict subset class above
each successive class generate broader set formal languages infinite sets strings composed finite sets symbols alphabets below
addition being important linguistics chomsky hierarchy also relevant theoretical computer science especially programming language theory compiler construction automata theory
minimalist program main article minimalist program since 1990 s much chomsky’s research focused calls minimalist program mp departs much past research instead attempts simplify language system relates meaning sound using minimum possible faculties expected given certain external conditions imposed us independently
chomsky dispenses concepts such 'deep structure' 'surface structure' instead places emphasis large number plastic cerebral circuits along come infinite number concepts 'logical forms
exposed linguistic data brain hearer-speaker then proceeds associate sound meaning rules grammar observe fact consequences side effects way language works
thus while much chomsky's prior research focused rules language now focuses mechanisms brain uses create these rules

james mc gilvray 2014 chomsky's political views changed little since childhood adopted emphasis political activism ingrained jewish working-class tradition
usually identifies anarcho-syndicalist and/or libertarian socialist
views these positions precise political theories ideals thinks best meet needs humans liberty community association under conditions freedom
unlike other socialists such those accept marxism chomsky believes politics lies outside remit science
key thrust behind much chomsky's political world-view idea truth political realities systematically distorted suppressed through manipulation corporate interests elites while work focused revealing these manipulations
