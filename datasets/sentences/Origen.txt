patristic scholar mark j edwards argued many origen's positions properly aristotelian strictly platonic instance philosophical anthropology
nonetheless thus pronounced idealist regarding things temporal material insignificant indifferent real eternal things being comprised idea
therefore regards purely ideal center spiritual eternal world god pure reason whose creative powers call being world matter necessary substratum
origen's cosmology complicated controverted seems held hypothesis preexistence souls
before known world created god created great number spiritual intelligences
first devoted contemplation love their creator almost these intelligences eventually grew bored contemplating god their love cooled off
those whose love god diminished most became demons
those whose love diminished moderately became human souls eventually incarnated fleshly bodies
those whose love diminished least became angels
however remained perfectly devoted god became through love word logos god
logos eventually took flesh born virgin mary becoming god-man jesus christ
diverse conditions human beings born actually dependent upon their souls pre-existent state
thus seems unfair being born poor others wealthy sick others healthy forth origen insists actually by-product free-will souls
thus material creation least implicitly lesser ontological category immaterial spiritual heavy material bodies man assumes after fall will eventually cast off
origen however still insisted bodily resurrection contrast athenagoras believed earthly bodies precisely reconstituted hereafter origen argued paul's notion flourishing spiritual body appropriate
rigid adherent scripture making no statement without adducing scriptural basis
scriptures divinely inspired proved both fulfillment prophecy immediate impression scriptures made those read them
since divine logos spoke scriptures organic whole every occasion combatted gnostic tenet inferiority old testament
exegesis origen sought discover deeper meaning implied scriptures
chief methods translation proper names enabled like philo find deep meaning even every event history see hermeneutics same time insisted exact grammatical interpretation text basis exegesis
strict adherent church origen yet distinguished sharply ideal empirical church representing double church men angels platonic phraseology lower church celestial ideal
ideal church alone church christ scattered over earth other provided also shelter sinners
holding church being possession mysteries affords means salvation indifferent her external organization although spoke sometimes office-bearers pillars church their heavy duties responsibilities
important idea borrowed plato grand division great human multitude capable sensual vision those know how comprehend hidden meaning scripture diverse mysteries church organization being former
doubtful whether origen possessed obligatory creed any rate such confession faith norm like inspired word scripture
reason illumined divine logos able search secret depths divine nature remains source knowledge
theological dogmatic origen's conception god father apophatic—a perfect unity invisible incorporeal transcending things material therefore inconceivable incomprehensible
likewise unchangeable transcends space time

logos rational creative principle permeates universe
since god eternally manifests himself logos likewise eternal
forms bridge created uncreated through visible representative divine wisdom inconceivable incorporeal god known
creation came existence through logos god's nearest approach world command create
while logos substantially unity comprehends multiplicity concepts origen terms platonic fashion essence essences idea ideas
defense unity god against gnostics led origen maintain subordination logos god doctrine eternal generation later
origen distinctly emphasized independence logos well distinction being substance god
term same substance father employed
logos holy spirit also however does share divinity god
image reflex god god communicates divinity light radiating sun
origen taught though son subordinate less father power substance rank relation son father no beginning son eternally generated
logos doctrine cosmology activity logos conceived origen platonic fashion world soul wherein god manifested omnipotence
first creative act divine spirit independent existence partial reflexes logos created rational beings revert perfect god their background must likewise perfect yet their perfection unlike kind god logos divine spirit attained
freedom will essential fact reason notwithstanding foreknowledge god
logos eternally creative forms endless series finite comprehensible worlds mutually alternative
combining stoic doctrine universe without beginning biblical doctrine beginning end world conceived visible world stages eternal cosmic process affording also explanation diversity human fortunes rewards punishments
material world first no place eternal spiritual progression due fall spirits god first being serpent imprisoned matter body
ultimate aim god creation matter out nothing punishment upraising fallen spirits
man's accidental being rooted transitory matter higher nature formed image creator
soul divided rational irrational latter being material transitory while former incorporeal immaterial possesses freedom will power reascend purer life
strong ethical import cosmic process remain unnoticed
return original being through divine reason object entire cosmic process

origen's concept logos allowed make no definite statement redemptive work jesus
since sin ultimately negative lack pure knowledge activity jesus essentially example instruction human life incidental contrasted immanent cosmic activity logos
origen regarded death jesus sacrifice paralleling other cases self-sacrifice general good
origen's accord teachings church merely superficial
[citation needed] eschatology idealizing tendency consider spiritual alone real fundamental entire system led combat rude crude chiliasm see christian eschatology sensual beyond
position literal resurrection physical bodies difficult both contra celsum first principles origen affirms form bodily resurrection eschews notion earthly bodies will raised account their gross materiality

character origen christian church first theologian
teaching merely theoretical also imbued intense ethical power
multitude whom instruction beyond grasp left mediating images symbols well final goal attainment
origen christianity blended pagan philosophy lived desire truth longing after god
origen many admirers followers particular dionysius alexandria caused controversy throughout libya 259 due theology regards unity trinity
three centuries later very name stricken books church yet monasteries greeks influence still lived spiritual father greek monasticism
origen's influence later church anathemas 544 553 while patriarch mennas constantinople condemned origen form apocatastasis synod constantinople 543 experts divided whether second council constantinople fifth ecumenical council 553 ratified condemnation authentically [only] certain council opened 5 may 553 spite protestations pope vigilius though constantinople refused attend eight conciliary sessions 5 may 2 june acts possess question three chapters treated
many heteroclite views became associated origen 15 anathemas attributed council condemn form apocatastasis along pre-existence soul animism heterodox christology denial real lasting resurrection body
authorities believe these anathemas belong earlier local synod
anathema against origen person declaring among others heretic reads follows anyone does anathematize arius eunomius macedonius apollinaris nestorius eutyches origen well their impious writings also other heretics already condemned anathematized holy catholic apostolic church aforesaid four holy synods [if anyone does equally anathematize] those held hold their impiety persist holding end same opinion those heretics just mentioned let anathema
result condemnation writings origen supporting teachings these areas destroyed
either destroyed outright translated appropriate adjustments eliminate conflict orthodox christian doctrine
therefore little direct evidence remains fully confirm disprove origen's support nine points anathema against
fifth ecumenical council addressed called three chapters opposed form origenism truly nothing origen origenist views
fact popes vigilius 537–555 pelagius 556–61 pelagius ii 579–90 gregory great 590–604 aware fifth council specifically dealt three chapters make no mention origenism universalism nor spoke knew condemnation - even though gregory great opposed belief universalism

[need quotation verify] origen greeks' transmigration soul may may agreed
many theologians share notion origen's extant works latin translations original greek confirm believe reincarnation
cognizant concept transmigration metensomatosis transformation loses once human soul will greek philosophy repeatedly stated concept part christian teaching scripture
translation commentary gospel matthew stems 6 th-century latin translation reads place [when jesus elijah come referred john baptist] does appear me elijah soul spoken lest fall doctrine transmigration foreign church god handed down apostles nor anywhere set forth scriptures ibid
conversely origen's against celsus argues teaching resurrection does come doctrine reincarnation yet contradictorily claims know soul transmigrates body body our teaching subject resurrection celsus imagines derived anything heard doctrine metempsychosis know soul immaterial invisible nature exists no material place without having body suited nature place
accordingly time puts off body necessary before no longer adequate changed state exchanges second another time assumes another addition former needed better covering suited purer ethereal regions heaven
comes world birth casts off integuments needed womb before doing puts another body suited life upon earth

shown incorporeal reasonable being life itself independently body worse off body out then beyond doubt bodies secondary importance arise time time meet varying conditions reasonable creatures
those require bodies clothed them contrariwise fallen souls lifted themselves up better things their bodies once annihilated
thus ever vanishing ever reappearing
jerome further elaborates origen's ideas avitus moreover [origen writes that] avoid agony punishment burning flame sensitive may choose become low organisms dwell water assume shape animal reason fear metamorphosis four-footed things even fishes
then lest [origen] should held guilty maintaining pythagoras transmigration souls winds up wicked reasoning wounded reader saying must taken make dogmas these things thrown out conjectures show altogether overlooked
jerome adds hellfire moreover torments holy scripture threatens sinners [origen] explains external punishments pangs guilty consciences god's power memory our transgressions set before our eyes
whole crop our sins grows up afresh seeds remain soul our dishonourable undutiful acts again pictured before our gaze
thus fire conscience stings remorse torture mind looks back former self-indulgence
again perhaps coarse earthly body ought described mist darkness end world becomes necessary pass another like darkness will lead like physical birth
