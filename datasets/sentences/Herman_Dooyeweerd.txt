introductions dooyeweerd's thought
2 influences development 9 external links dooyeweerd’s critiques philosophy dooyeweerd made both immanent transcendental critiques western philosophy following traditions continental philosophy
immanent critique sought understand each philosophic thinker's work each tradition inside uncover own terms basic presuppositions reveal deep problems
such immanent critique philosophic thinkers pre-socratic greeks onwards through middle twentieth century including mediaeval period modern periods dooyeweerd claimed demonstrated theoretical thinking based presuppositions religious nature called ground motives
ground motive spiritual driving force impels each thinker interpret reality under influence
dooyeweerd identified four major ground-motives western thought three them dualistic nature form-matter divide greek thought creation-fall-redemption motive biblical hebrew semitic thought nature-grace divide mediaeval scholastic thought nature-freedom divide humanistic enlightenment thought means theoretical thought never neutral autonomous thinker
however dooyeweerd remained unsatisfied argument shows fact philosophy influenced religious convictions
rather wants show cannot otherwise because part nature philosophy theoretical thought
led dooyeweerd undertake transcendental critique theoretical thought kind immanuel kant pioneered
whereas kant husserl sought conditions make theoretical thinking possible still presupposed theoretical attitude possible
dooyeweerd sought understand conditions make theoretical attitude possible argued theoretical thought takes place reference origin meaning ground-motive adhere extra-rationally
means[clarification needed] theoretical thought never neutral autonomous thinker
dooyeweerd argued good philosophy addresses three fundamental parts idea world coherence rationalities origin meaning proposed enable disparate theoretical philosophical approaches enter discourse each other long each thinker openly admits their own ground-motive
dooyeweerd accordingly made very explicit own grounding creation-fall-redemption neo-calvinist flavour debt abraham kuyper
dooyeweerd's cosmonomic philosophy dooyeweerd's cosmonomic philosophy different most extant philosophy least three ways intertwine first takes seriously pre-theoretical attitude thought starting point begin understand makes theoretical thought possible
most other philosophical thinking begins presupposing theoretical attitude either ignores everyday experience attempts explain theoretically either way presupposing possibility theoretical thought way knowledge
making possibility theoretical thought philosophical problem address dooyeweerd went deeper further kant husserl heidegger others
[citation needed] second rooted different presuppositions 'ground motives' nature reality religious nature
whereas greek philosophy rooted form/matter divide scholastic thinking mediaeval christianity nature/grace divide humanistic philosophy nature/freedom divide dooyeweerd began biblical idea creation fall redemption
may explored philosophical rather theological implications idea
called philosophy 'christian philosophy' though usually claims label scholastic nature very different
third posits meaning fundamental being process
dooyeweerd expressed meaning being created even our selfhood nature even our selfhood
religious root divine origin
meaningfulness originates creator god rather sovereign human attribution
things just those linked humanity meaningful
strictly dooyeweerd says things rather meaning
thus meaning like ocean swim enabler our existence functioning rather property attribute things words
diversity science implications science
science whether mathematical natural human social sciences - seen abstracting certain aspects study
example even though lawyer biologist might study same things say fingerprints interested different aspects
looking meaning thing different focus though equally concerned real
perceptions reality through kind scientific attitude selecting aspect distinct others study will necessarily governed fundamental assumptions how these various kinds meaning related another coherent whole belonging within total range experiences
likewise everyday life aware distinct aspects though most time function them tacitly
aspects positing meaning fundamental priority given our pre-theoretical experience diverse meaning prompts thinker ask ways there being meaningful cannot reduced each other? different aspects there things? delineated fifteen mere categories modalities ways being functioning etc
quantitative aspect amount spatial aspect continuous extension kinematic aspect flowing movement physical aspect energy matter biotic/organic aspect life functions self-maintenance sensitive/psychic aspect feeling response analytical aspect distinction conceptualization formative aspect formative power achievement technology technique lingual aspect symbolic communication social aspect social interaction economic aspect frugal use resources aesthetic aspect harmony surprise fun juridical aspect due rights responsibility ethical aspect self-giving love pistic aspect faith vision commitment belief dooyeweerd claimed since discovery these addressed our theoretical functioning fallible no suite aspects including own lay claim material completion
implications aspects briefly aspects ways being meaningful 'law side' created reality
occurs does 'answering to' laws each aspect
being subject their laws
physical waves particles occur laws physical aspect poetry occurs laws aesthetic aspect
thus each aspect 'law sphere' may seen defining distinct kind possibility
earlier aspects determinative later ones normative
human beings function subject aspects animals subject up sensitive aspect plants up biotic non-living things up physical
you reading you functioning lingually understanding analytically conceptualizing sensitively seeing hearing etc
fact our functioning multi-aspectual though aspects might latent
things exist reference each aspect
example car exists physically load steel plastic etc
kinematically mode transport socially status symbol economically dent our finances aesthetically thing beauty biotically polluter pistically idol
being things multi-aspectual principle
knowledge may seen multi-aspectual knowing
example analytical knowing gives categories theories formative knowing gives skills lingual knowing gives 'bodies knowledge' found libraries
each aspect defines different rationality
way dooyeweerd echoes winch habermas though precision
older overview cosmonomic philosophy emphasis christian roots following attempted give overview cosmonomic philosophy deemed insufficient material used above
however being retained present because contains useful material used above readers might find useful
dooyeweerd attempted provide philosophy accounted differences non-human reality also thinker another
following abraham kuyper other earlier neo-calvinists dooyeweerd attempted describe reality creation god meaning god
god-given meaning displayed aspects temporal reality implications science
example even though lawyer biologist might study same things say fingerprints interested different aspects
looking meaning thing different focus though equally concerned real
perceptions reality through kind scientific attitude selecting aspect distinct others study will necessarily governed fundamental assumptions how these various kinds meaning related another coherent whole belonging within total range experiences
dooyeweerd argued showed need consistent radically christian philosophy sought provide
furthermore attempted show even imaginations men part same created reality even misguided cannot escape being subject rule god exposed christian revelation
dooyeweerd self-consciously allowed christian perspective guide understanding philosophical rather theological mode thought
believed permitted philosopher gain insight principle diversity meaning held together unity directs thought toward origin things god god's purpose making things found christ
basic religious orientation should affect way christian understands things
contrast dualistic type religious ground motive dooyeweerd suggested christian's basic orientation world ought derived human speculation god's revealed purposes creation fall sin redemption christ
christian religious ground motive fundamentally different posture toward things compared say form/matter scheme greeks nature/grace synthesis medieval christianity nature/freedom approach enlightenment orientations divided against themselves their reliance upon two contradictory principles
while christian religious view things created fallen being redeemed often blended speculative dualistic schemes never really become fully identified them there historical continuity christian thought despite fact undergone numerous significant shifts dooyeweerd's view
fact capable being blended convincingly exposes transcendental rules both false true theories subject
religious ground motive spiritual driving force impels each thinker interpret reality under influence
dooyeweerd case thinkers presume human thought autonomous operate dictum does matter whether god exists such thinker's basic commitment autonomous thought forces pick out aspect creation origin meaning
doing supposedly autonomous thinker made captive kind idol own making bends understanding conform dictates according dooyeweerd
although self-consciously exposes religious nature philosophy dooyeweerd suggests fact thought inescapably religious character
religious stamp disguised supposed origin meaning toward various thinkers direct their thought called god rather aspect creation
suggests explains why humanistic science will produce bitterly conflicting ideologies
helps locate antithesis source irreducible differences various perspectives
antithesis must accounted foundational issue any complete philosophy antithesis religious nature according dooyeweerd
borrowing language concepts wide variety philosophical schools especially edmund husserl marburg school neo-kantianism ernst cassirer's philosophy symbolic forms—and contend franz xaver von baader[a] dooyeweerd builds foundation supposed antithesis make distinctions kind thinking another theorizing diverse kinds thinking disclose diverse kinds meaning meaning corresponds way actual state affairs
dooyeweerd developed anti-reductionist ontology modal aspects concerning diverse kinds meaning disclosed analysis every existent thing
considered such modes irreducible each other yet indissolubly linked
dooyeweerd first suggested there 14 modes later postulated 15
indissoluble coherence these modal aspects evinced through their analogical relationship another finally their concentration central religious selfhood direct relationship origin god
