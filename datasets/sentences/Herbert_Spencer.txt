synthetic philosophy basis spencer's appeal many generation appeared offer ready-made system belief substitute conventional religious faith time orthodox creeds crumbling under advances modern science
spencer's philosophical system seemed demonstrate possible believe ultimate perfection humanity basis advanced scientific conceptions such first law thermodynamics biological evolution
essence spencer's philosophical vision formed combination deism positivism
hand imbibed something eighteenth century deism father other members derby philosophical society books like george combe's immensely popular constitution man 1828
treated world cosmos benevolent design laws nature decrees 'being transcendentally kind
natural laws thus statutes well governed universe decreed creator intention promoting human happiness
although spencer lost christian faith teenager later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception deity nonetheless held fast conception almost sub-conscious level
same time however owed far ever acknowledge positivism particular conception philosophical system unification various branches scientific knowledge
also followed positivism insistence possible genuine knowledge phenomena hence idle speculate nature ultimate reality
tension positivism residual deism ran through entire system synthetic philosophy
spencer followed comte aiming unification scientific truth sense philosophy aimed 'synthetic
like comte committed universality natural law idea laws nature applied without exception organic realm much inorganic human mind much rest creation
first objective synthetic philosophy thus demonstrate there no exceptions being able discover scientific explanations form natural laws phenomena universe
spencer's volumes biology psychology sociology intended demonstrate existence natural laws these specific disciplines
even writings ethics held possible discover 'laws' morality status laws nature while still having normative content conception traced george combe's constitution man
second objective synthetic philosophy show these same laws led inexorably progress
contrast comte stressed unity scientific method spencer sought unification scientific knowledge form reduction natural laws fundamental law law evolution
respect followed model laid down edinburgh publisher robert chambers anonymous vestiges natural history creation 1844
although often dismissed lightweight forerunner charles darwin's origin species chambers' book reality programme unification science aimed show laplace's nebular hypothesis origin solar system lamarck's theory species transformation both instances lewes' phrase 'one magnificent generalisation progressive development
chambers associated chapman's salon work served unacknowledged template synthetic philosophy
evolution spencer first articulated evolutionary perspective essay 'progress law cause' published chapman's westminster review 1857 later formed basis first principles new system philosophy 1862
expounded theory evolution combined insights samuel taylor coleridge's essay 'the theory life' itself derivative friedrich von schelling's naturphilosophie generalisation von baer's law embryological development
spencer posited structures universe develop simple undifferentiated homogeneity complex differentiated heterogeneity while being accompanied process greater integration differentiated parts
evolutionary process found work spencer believed throughout cosmos
universal law applying stars galaxies much biological organisms human social organisation much human mind
differed other scientific laws greater generality laws special sciences shown illustrations principle
however bertrand russell stated letter beatrice webb 1923 formulation problems 'i don't know whether [spencer] ever made realise implications second law thermodynamics may well upset
law says everything tends uniformity dead level diminishing increasing heterogeneity'
objection evolution case still regularly made anti-evolutionists does apply darwinian approaches
applicable matter energy complex social systems
spencer's attempt explain evolution complexity radically different found darwin's origin species published two years later
spencer often quite erroneously believed merely appropriated generalised darwin's work natural selection
although after reading darwin's work coined phrase 'survival fittest' own term darwin's concept often misrepresented thinker merely applied darwinian theory society grudgingly incorporated natural selection preexisting overall system
primary mechanism species transformation recognised lamarckian use-inheritance posited organs developed diminished use disuse resulting changes may transmitted future generations
spencer believed evolutionary mechanism also necessary explain 'higher' evolution especially social development humanity
moreover contrast darwin held evolution direction end-point attainment final state equilibrium
tried apply theory biological evolution sociology
proposed society product change lower higher forms just theory biological evolution lowest forms life evolving higher forms
spencer claimed man's mind evolved same way simple automatic responses lower animals process reasoning thinking man

these hypothetical hereditary units similar darwin's gemmules
sociology portrait spencer spencer read excitement original positivist sociology auguste comte
philosopher science comte proposed theory sociocultural evolution society progresses general law three stages
writing after various developments biology however spencer rejected regarded ideological aspects comte's positivism attempting reformulate social science terms principle evolution applied biological psychological sociological aspects universe
given primacy spencer placed evolution work spencer's sociology might described socially darwinistic though strictly speaking proponent lamarckism rather darwinism
despite popularity view such description spencer's sociology mistaken
while spencer's political ethical writings themes consistent social darwinism such themes present spencer's sociological works focus building theory regarding how processes societal growth differentiation lead changing amounts complexity amongst various forms social organization evolutionary progression simple undifferentiated homogeneity complex differentiated heterogeneity exemplified spencer argued development society
developed theory two types society militant industrial corresponded evolutionary progression
militant society structured around relationships hierarchy obedience simple undifferentiated industrial society based voluntary contractually assumed social obligations complex differentiated
society spencer conceptualised 'social organism' evolved simpler state complex according universal law evolution
moreover industrial society direct descendant ideal society developed social statics although spencer now equivocated over whether evolution society result anarchism first believed whether pointed continued role state albeit reduced minimal functions enforcement contracts external defence
though spencer made valuable contributions early sociology least influence structural functionalism attempt introduce lamarckian darwinian ideas realm sociology unsuccessful
considered many furthermore actively dangerous
hermeneuticians period such wilhelm dilthey pioneer distinction natural sciences naturwissenschaften human sciences geisteswissenschaften
united states sociologist lester frank ward elected first president american sociological association launched relentless attack spencer's theories laissez-faire political ethics
although ward admired much spencer's work believed spencer's prior political biases distorted thought led astray
1890 s émile durkheim established formal academic sociology firm emphasis practical social research
turn 20 th century first generation german sociologists most notably max weber presented methodological antipositivism
however should noted spencer's theories laissez-faire survival-of-the-fittest minimal human interference processes natural law enduring even increasing appeal social science fields economics political science writer recently made case spencer's importance sociology must learn take energy society seriously
agnosticism spencer's reputation among victorians owed great deal agnosticism
rejected theology representing 'impiety pious
gain much notoriety repudiation traditional religion frequently condemned religious thinkers allegedly advocating atheism materialism
nonetheless unlike thomas henry huxley whose agnosticism militant creed directed 'the unpardonable sin faith' adrian desmond's phrase spencer insisted concerned undermine religion name science bring reconciliation two
starting either religious belief science spencer argued ultimately driven accept certain indispensable literally inconceivable notions
whether concerned creator substratum underlies our experience phenomena frame no conception
therefore spencer concluded religion science agree supreme truth human understanding capable 'relative' knowledge
case since owing inherent limitations human mind possible obtain knowledge phenomena reality 'the absolute' underlying phenomena
hence both science religion must come recognise 'most certain facts power universe manifests us utterly inscrutable
called awareness 'the unknowable' presented worship unknowable capable being positive faith substitute conventional religion
indeed thought unknowable represented ultimate stage evolution religion final elimination last anthropomorphic vestiges

whereas biology competition various organisms result death species organism kind competition spencer advocated closer used economists competing individuals firms improve well being rest society
spencer viewed private charity positively encouraging both voluntary association informal care aid those need rather relying government bureaucracy force
further recommended private charitable efforts wise avoid encouraging formation new dependent families those unable support themselves without charity
