carr began magnum opus arguing 1917 october revolution proletarian revolution forced bolsheviks
carr argued masses drove their hesitating temporising leaders down path revolution
carr's view soviet history went through three periods inter-war era personified change leadership vladimir lenin joseph stalin
after initial period chaos carr dissolution russian constituent assembly january 1918 last tearing asunder veil bourgeois constitutionalism henceforward bolsheviks rule russia their own way
carr like many others argued emergence russia backward peasant economy leading industrial power most important event 20 th century
first part history soviet russia comprised three volumes entitled bolshevik revolution published 1950 1952 1953 traced soviet history 1917 1922
second part intended comprise three volumes called struggle power intended cover 1922–28 carr instead decided publish single volume labelled interregnum covered events 1923–24 another four volumes entitled socialism country took story up 1926
final volumes series entitled foundations planned economy covered years until 1929
originally carr planned take series up operation barbarossa 1941 soviet victory 1945 death 1982 put end project

carr history soviet russia lenin's astonishing achievements soviet leader
carr argued soviet history went through three periods 1917–45 era
first phrase war communism era 1917–21 saw much rationing economic production focused huge centres manufacturing critical services supplies being sold either set prices free large extent return barter economy
carr contended problems agrarian sector forced abandonment war communism 1921 replacement new economic policy nep
during same period saw carr called lenin's astonishing achievements namely gathering together nearly former territories imperial russia notable exceptions finland poland lithuania latvia estonia under banner soviet union
nep period 1921–28 carr maintained soviet economy became mixed capitalist-socialist peasants after fulfilling quotas state being allowed sell their surplus open market industrialists being permitted produce sell agricultural light industrial goods
carr contended post-lenin succession struggle after 1924 personal disputes ideological quarrels
carr's opinion personalities rather principles stake
carr argued victory stalin over leon trotsky succession struggle inevitable because stalin better suited new order emerging soviet union 1920 s trotsky
carr stated trotsky hero revolution
fell heroic age over
carr argued stalin stumbled doctrine socialism country accident design 1925 argued stalin swift grasp how effective doctrine weapon beat trotsky
carr easy basis new doctrine depict stalin true expositor bolshevism leninism opponents heirs those resisted lenin denied bolshevik creed past
unwittingly stalin forged himself instrument enormous power
once forged quick discover strength wielded masterful skill ruthlessness
beside reviewing politics economics 1920 s carr also devoted considerable space soviet constitution 1922 relationship soviet socialist republics moscow efforts revitalize soviets councils development red army ogpu
writing ogpu carr noted since bolsheviks eliminated their enemies outside party mid-1920 s repressive powers ogpu henceforth directed primarily against opposition party effective form opposition state
reflecting background diplomat scholar international relations carr provided detailed treatment foreign affairs focus both narkomindel comintern
particular carr examined relationship soviet communist party other communist parties around world comintern's structure soviet reaction locarno treaties early efforts ultimately successful 1949 promote revolution china
third phrase period five-year plans beginning first five-year plan 1928 saw soviet state promoting growth heavy industry eliminating private enterprise collectivising agriculture quotas industrial production being set moscow
carr's opinion changes wrought first five year plan positive development
60 carr argued economic system existed during n
period highly inefficient any economic system based planning state superior carr saw disorganized chaos capitalism
60 carr accepted soviet claim so-called kulaks existed distinct class negative social force such dekulakisation campaign saw least 2 million alleged kulaks deported gulag 1930–32 necessary measure improved lives soviet peasantry
62–63 r
davies carr's associate co-writer history soviet russia expressed doubts carr whatever kulaks actually existed thought term invention soviet propaganda reflection social conditions soviet countryside
accompanying these social-economic changes changes leadership
carr argued lenin saw himself leader elite band revolutionaries sought give power people wanted world revolution
contrast carr claimed stalin bureaucratic leader concentrated power own hands ruled ruthless fashion carried policy revolution above promoting merger russian nationalism communism cared interests soviet union world communist movement
however carr argued stalin's achievements making soviet union great industrial power large outweighed any actions commonly criticized
carr claimed stalin played both roles dictator emancipator simultaneously argued reflected less man times place lived
carr stalin's personality combined primitive cruel traditions russian bureaucracy imparted revolution above particularly brutal quality
book part history soviet russia series though closely related due common research same archives carr's 1951 book german-soviet relations two world wars 1919–1939
book carr blamed british prime minister neville chamberlain german-soviet non-aggression pact 1939 accusing deliberately snubbing stalin's offers alliance
such molotov–ribbentrop pact policy soviets followed summer 1939
carr argued british guarantee poland given 31 march 1939 foolhardy move indicated chamberlain's preference alliance poland opposed alliance soviet union
carr argued anglo-french delegation sent travel moscow ship august 1939 negotiate unimpressive diplomats their unwillingness inability pressure poles grant transit rights red army reflected fundamental lack interest reaching alliance soviet union
contrast carr argued willingness german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop come moscow anytime plane full powers negotiate whatever necessary secure german-soviet alliance reflected deep german interest reaching understanding soviets 1939
according carr bastion created means pact line defence against potential german attack
important advantage projected carr soviet russia eventually fight hitler western powers already involved
molotov–ribbentrop pact signed moscow 23 august 1939

behind german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop first secretary-general joseph stalin
carr leading defender soviet-german non-aggression pact 1939 example realism international relations
1955 major scandal damaged carr's reputation historian soviet union occurred introduction notes journal supposed memoir former soviet foreign commissar maxim litvinov shortly thereafter exposed kgb forgery
american historian barry rubin argued easily established notes anti-semitic forgery litvinov portrayed proud jew whereas real litvinov see himself jewish importantly notes showed litvinov together other soviet officials jewish origin working behind scenes jewish interests soviet union
rubin also noted other improbabilities notes journal such having litvinov meeting regularly rabbis order further jewish interests
rubin argued portrayal litvinov reflected soviet anti-semitism carr amiss recognizing notes journal anti-semitic forgery
first volume history soviet russia published 1950 criticized historians most notably british marxist historian isaac deutscher close friend being too concerned institutional development soviet state being impersonal dry capturing little tremendous emotions times
likewise carr criticized both left right downplaying importance ideology bolsheviks argument bolsheviks thought terms russia rather entire world
1955 article deutscher argued perhaps main weakness mr carr's conception sees russian revolution virtually national phenomenon
treats historical process essentially national character self-sufficient within national framework
thinks terms statecraft statecraft national
lenin russian super-bismarck
despite criticism deutscher ended review writing mr carr's enduring distinguished merit first genuine historian soviet regime
59 echoing deutscher's criticism american historian bertram wolfe contended 1955 mr carr believes revolution right russia
cannot quite make himself believe matter world revolution power-concentrated dogmatic man [lenin] deadly earnest
often observed carr little sympathy towards revolutionaries presenting pre-1917 bolsheviks somewhat comic ridiculous figures
walter laqueur noted carr strong preference lenin politician attempting build new order russia after 1917 vs
lenin revolutionary working destroy old order before 1917 scope scale history soviet russia illustrated letter carr tamara deutscher volume carr wished examine soviet relations western nations 1926 1929 relations communist party soviet union western communist parties efforts promote world revolution work machinery comintern profintern communist thinking negro question united states history communist parties china outer mongolia turkey egypt afghanistan dutch east indies

cohen's biography nikolai bukharin published times literary supplement carr lashed out against cohen advocating thesis bukharin represented better alternative stalin
carr dismissed cohen's argument nep viable alternative first five year plan contemptuously labelled bukharin weak-willed rather pathetic figure both destined deserved lose stalin post-lenin succession struggle
carr ended review scornful remark since american left produce nothing losers like george mc govern natural american leftist like cohen sympathize bukharin whom carr likewise regarded great loser history

book carr examined response comintern fascism 1930–1935
carr maintained comintern divided two fractions early 1930 s
fraction headed hungarian communist béla kun preferred policy treating non-communist left disguised fascists whereas another fraction headed bulgarian communist georgi dimitrov supported policy building popular fronts socialists liberals against fascism
carr argued adoption popular front policy 1935 forced stalin pressure communist parties abroad especially french communist party carr contended 7 th congress comintern 1935 essentially end comintern since marked abandonment world revolution goal instead subordinated cause communism world revolution towards goal building popular fronts against fascism another related book carr unable complete before death published posthumously 1984 comintern spanish civil war

most unusually book western historian history soviet russia met warily favourable reviews soviet historians
normally any works western historians no matter how favourable communism met hostile reviews soviet union there even brand polemical literature soviet historians attacking so-called bourgeois historians under xenophobic grounds soviet historians capable understanding soviet past
history soviet russia series translated russian published soviet union until 1990
soviet journal commented carr almost unknown broad soviet readership though soviet historians aware work most them considerable respect carr unable say until perestroika
those soviet historians specialized rebutting bourgeois falsifiers western historians labelled soviet union attacked carr writing soviet countryside chaos after 1917 praised carr few bourgeois authors truth soviet economic achievements
through right up until glasnost period carr considered bourgeois falsifier soviet union carr praised british historian taken certain steps towards marxism whose history soviet russia described fairly objective most fundamental works bourgeois sovietology
preface soviet edition history soviet russia 1990 soviet historian albert nenarokov lifetime carr 'automatically ranked falsifiers fact history soviet russia scrupulous professionally conscientious work
nenarokov called carr honest objective scholar espousing liberal principles attempting basis enormous documentary base create satisfactory picture epoch considering those involved assist sober realistic perception ussr better understanding great social processes twentieth century
however nenarokov expressed concern carr's use stalinist language such calling bukharin part right deviation party without use quotation marks
nenarokov took view carr too narrowly reduced soviet history after 1924 down choice either stalin trotsky arguing bukharin better humane alternative both stalin trotsky
pro-soviet slant carr's history soviet russia attracted controversy
american writer max eastman 1950 review first volume history soviet russia called carr mild-quiet-hearted bourgeois vicarious taste revolutionary violence 1951 austrian journalist franz borkenau monat newspaper human suffering seems say historical factor carr belongs those very cold people believe think act iciest calculation therefore fail understand why mistaken their calculations time time again
1955 review commentary bertram wolfe accused carr systemically taking lenin's point view history soviet russia volumes being unwilling consider other perspectives russian history
1962 british historian hugh trevor-roper argued carr's identification victors history meant carr saw stalin historically important carr neither time nor sympathy millions stalin's victims
anglo-american historian robert conquest argued carr took official reasons launching first five year plan too seriously argued crisis late 1920 s result soviet misunderstanding economics objective economic crisis forced stalin
furthermore conquest maintained carr's opponents such leonard schapiro adam ulam bertram wolfe robert c
tucker richard pipes far better understanding soviet history carr
polish-born american historian richard pipes essential questions soviet history bolsheviks want why follow them others resist? intellectual moral atmosphere these events occurred? went note carr failed pose these questions let alone answer them
pipes later compare carr's single paragraph dismissal history soviet russia 1921 famine unimportant because there no sources death toll carr deemed trustworthy holocaust denial
polish kremlinologist leopold labedz criticized carr taking claims soviet government too seriously
labedz [carr] tended confine himself penumbra official formulations ideological formulas concealed rather revealed real soviet life
labedz argued regarded carr's worship kratos power led engage apologia stalin ignoring facts placed stalin unfavourable light highlighting those facts placed stalin positive light
labedz noted after 17 years after first volume history soviet russia series published carr criticize stalin volume series albeit once veiled form
labedz went argue carr's decision end history soviet russia series 1929 reflected lack documentary material carr claimed rather inability unwillingness confront horrors stalin's soviet union
labedz drew unflattering comparison carr edward gibbon labedz argued compare carr's approach gibbon's register contrast moral indifference gibbon's human concern blinkered pedantry gibbon's sovereign achievement sifting validation evidence
labedz very critical carr's handling sources arguing carr too inclined accept official soviet documents face value unwilling admit systematic falsification historical record under stalin
finally labedz took carr task over labedz regarded tendency white-wash soviet crimes behind abstract formula often combines progressive stereotypes lexicon soviet terminology
british historian norman stone argued carr guilty writing bland style meant hide pro-soviet sympathies
writing history soviet russia 1983 stone commented much book concerns economics subject carr hardly expert
lack definitive point book
makes dull unrevealing
like carr himself peters out
carr's history history soviet union effectively communist party soviet union
even then much kind unreconstructed stalinist version now see light day russia itself
am nearly tempted exclaim no useless set volumes ever masqueraded classic
carr's real talent lay mathematics
mathematical spirit took quality much abstraction autism carried over historical work
result trail devastation
stone later carr 2004 tocqueville says somewhere you approve dictatorship people means you despise people
carr did-he end life those dead peasants meant progress
orwell it's very well saying you can't make omelette without breaking eggs where's omelette? american historian walter laqueur argued history soviet russia volumes dubious historical source most part excluded mention unpleasant aspects soviet life reflecting carr's pro-soviet tendencies
laqueur commented carr called stalin ruthless tyrant 1979 book russian revolution noted almost totally refrained expressing any criticism stalin 14 volumes history soviet russia series
likewise laqueur contended carr excelled irony writing panegyrics soviet union forte
laqueur's opinion carr remembered future generations will books like dostoyevsky romantic exiles bakunin history soviet russia will besmirch fine reputation created those books
major source criticism history soviet russia carr's decision ignore russian civil war under grounds unimportant likewise devoting few lines kronstadt mutiny 1921 since carr argued minor event
laqueur commented opinion carr's ignoring russian civil war while paying inordinate amount attention such subjects relations swedish communist party soviet communist party soviet diplomatic relations outer mongolia 1920 s left history soviet russia very unbalanced
history? main article history? carr also famous today work historiography history? 1961 book based upon series g
trevelyan lectures delivered university cambridge january–march 1961
work carr argued presenting middle-of-the-road position empirical view history r
collingwood's idealism
carr rejected empirical view historian's work being accretion facts she their disposal nonsense
carr claimed belief hard core historical facts existing objectively independently interpretation historian preposterous fallacy very hard eradicate
carr maintained there such vast quantity information least post-dark ages times historian chooses facts she decides make use
carr's famous example claimed millions crossed rubicon julius caesar's crossing 49 bc declared noteworthy historians
carr divided facts two categories facts past historical information historians deem unimportant historical facts information historians decided important
carr contended historians quite arbitrarily determine facts past turn historical facts according their own biases agendas
carr stated study historian before you begin study facts
after very abstruse
already done intelligent undergraduate recommended read work great scholar jones st
jude's goes round friend st
jude's ask sort chap jones bees bonnet
you read work history listen out buzzing
you detect none either you tone deaf your historian dull dog
facts really like fish fishmonger's slab
like fish swimming vast sometimes inaccessible ocean historian catches will depend partly chance mainly part ocean chooses fish tackle chooses use these two factors being course determined kind fish wants catch
large historian will get kind facts wants
history means interpretation
indeed standing sir george clark head call history hard core interpretation surrounded pulp disputable facts my statement no doubt one-sided misleading no venture think original dictum reason carr argued leopold von ranke's famous dictum wie es eigentlich gewesen show actually happened wrong because presumed facts influenced historian rather historian choosing facts past she intended turn historical facts
same time carr argued study facts may lead historian change her views
way carr argued history unending dialogue past present
carr used example how believed facts past transformed facts history obscure riot took place wales 1850 saw gingerbread seller beaten death
carr argued incident totally ignored historians until 1950 s george kitson clark mentioned books
since kitson clark carr claimed several other historians cited same riot revealed victorian britain leading carr assert riot murder gingerbread seller progress going fact past fact history future will regularly cited historians
another example carr used theory publication 1932 papers former german foreign minister gustav stresemann secretary bernhard
carr noted stresemann died 1929 left behind 300 boxes papers relating time office 1932 bernhard published three volumes stresemann's papers under title stresemanns vermächtnis
carr noted because dawes plan locarno treaties stresemann co-winner nobel peace prize young plan bernhard devoted most papers stresemanns vermächtnis stresemann's work relations britain france united states
carr noted documents auswärtiges amt stresemann's own papers show stresemann far concerned relations soviet union instead western powers bernhard edited selection stresemanns vermächtnis focus stresemann's nobel peace prize-winning successes make seem like apostle peace really stresemann's major interests partitioning poland germany soviet union
moreover carr noted english translation stresemanns vermächtnis published 1935 translator abbreviated one-third german original focus those aspects stresemann's diplomacy primary interest british readers effect making seem stesemann almost exclusively concerned relations western powers little time relations soviet union
carr commented english translation stresemanns vermächtnis survived world war ii then historians seriously misled stresemann up foreign minister
finally carr argued conversations stresemann soviet foreign commissar georgy chicherin stresemann does most talking says intelligent original things leading carr suggest stresemann himself edited papers place himself best possible light
carr used stresemanns vermächtnis argue subjective nature documents historians used then used support attacks against idea work historians being purely totally objective observer lets facts speak themselves
likewise carr charged historians influenced present writing past
example used changing viewpoints german past expressed german historian friedrich meinecke during imperial weimar nazi post-war periods support contention
british historian hugh trevor-roper carr's leading critics summarised carr's argument george grote 19 th-century historian greece enlightened radical banker therefore picture periclean athens merely allegory 19 th century england seen enlightened banker
mommsen's history rome similarly dismissed product illustration pre-bismarckian germany
sir lewis namier's choice subject treatment simply show predictable prejudices polish conservative
general carr held deterministic outlook history
carr's opinion happens world cause events happened differently unless there different cause
carr's example one's friend smith suddenly starts acting out character day then must understood there reason strange behaviour reason exist smith acting normally
carr criticised counter-factual history parlour game played losers history
carr contended those engaged counter-factual speculations russian history such count pyotr stolypin's land reforms given enough time russian revolution prevented those uncomfortable bolsheviks being winners russian history their opponents
likewise carr asserted those stress importance accidents central causal agent history losers history wished play explain away their defeats workings chance fate
same way carr argued historians must concern themselves winners history
carr's example those score centuries cricket matches recorded those dismissed ducks same way carr maintained preoccupation losers equivalent someone listing losers cricket games
carr dismissed free will arguments made sir karl popper sir isaiah berlin cold war propaganda meant discredit communism
similar way carr took hostile view those historians stress workings chance contingency workings history
carr's view such historians understand their craft very well way identified losers history
same way carr argued no individual truly free social environment live contended within those limitations there room albeit very narrow room people make decisions impact history
carr made division those like vladimir lenin oliver cromwell helped shape social forces carried them historical greatness those like otto von bismarck napoleon rode back social forces over little no control
though carr willing grant individuals role history argued those focus exclusively individuals great man theory history doing profound disservice past
example carr complained those historians explained russian revolution solely result stupidity emperor nicholas ii carr regarded factor lesser importance rather working great social forces
carr claimed examining causation history historians should seek find rational causes historical occurrences causes generalized across time explain other occurrences other times places
carr historical accidents generalized thus worth historian's time
carr illustrated theory telling story man named robinson went out buy cigarettes night killed automobile defective brakes driven drunk driver named jones sharp turn road
carr argued contend real reasons accident killed robinson might defective brakes sharp turn road inebriated state jones argue robinson's wish buy cigarettes cause death while factor real cause death
such carr argued those seeking prevent repeat robinson's death well pass laws regulating drunk driving straightening sharp turn road quality automobile brakes wasting their time passing law forbidding people take walk buy cigarettes
too subtle dig critics determinism like sir karl popper sir isaiah berlin carr spoke inquiry robinson's death being interrupted two distinguished gentlemen maintained quite vehemently robinson's wish buy cigarettes caused death
same way carr argued historians needed find real causes historical events finding general trend inspire better understanding present focusing role accidental incidental
example attack role accidents history carr mocked hypothesis cleopatra's nose pascal's thought magnetism exerted nose cleopatra mark anthony there no affair two hence second triumvirate broken up therefore roman republic continued
carr sarcastically commented male attraction female beauty hardly considered accident rather most common cases cause effect world
other examples cleopatra's nose type history cited carr claim edward gibbon turkish sultan bayezid suffer gout conquered central europe winston churchill's statement king alexander died monkey bite greco-turkish war avoided leon trotsky's remark contracted cold while duck hunting missed crucial politburo meeting 1923
rather accidents carr asserted history series causal chains interacting each other
carr contemptuously compared those like winston churchill book world crisis claimed death king alexander monkey bite caused greek-turkish war those claim real cause robinson's death due desire buy cigarettes
carr argued claim history series accidents merely expression pessimism carr claimed dominant mood britain 1961 due decline british empire
bust cleopatra vii
history? carr dismissed theory cleopatra's nose example power accidents history carr's opinion historical works serve broaden society's understanding past via generalisations right socially acceptable works
citing dutch historian pieter geyl carr argued values society changes values historical works
carr used geyl's 1946 book napoleon voor en tegen de franse geschiedschrijving napoleon against how different french historians viewed napoleon different periods make case historians influenced society times live
carr argued society continues progress 20 th century historians must change values apply writing their works reflect work progress
carr argued during lectures karl marx developed schema understanding past present future reflected proper dual role historian both analyse past provide call action present order create better future humanity
carr emphatically contended history social science art
carr argued history should considered social science because historians like scientists seek generalizations helped broaden understanding one's subject
carr used example word revolution arguing word specific meaning make no sense historians write revolutions even though every revolution occurred history own way unique
moreover carr claimed historical generalisations often related lessons learned other historical occurrences
since carr's view lessons sought learned history then history like science any art
though carr conceded historians predict exact events future argued historical generalisations supply information useful understanding both present future
carr argued since scientists purely neutral observers reciprocal relationship objects under their study just like historians supported identifying history sciences rather arts
likewise carr contended history like science no moral judgments opinion supports identification history science
carr well known assertions history? denying moral judgements history
carr argued ahistorical historian judge people different times according moral values her time
carr argued individuals should judged terms values their time place values historian's time and/or place
carr's opinion historians should act judges
carr quoted thomas carlyle's remark british reaction french revolution exaggeration abounds execration wailing whole darkness
complained exactly same too much western commentary writing russian revolution
likewise carr quoted carlyle reign terror way confronting western complaints soviet terror horrible lands known equal justice-not unnatural lands never known
thus carr argued within context soviet union stalin force good
1979 essay carr argued stalin revived outdid worst brutalities earlier tsars record excited revulsion later generations historians
yet achievement borrowing west forcing primitive russia material foundations modern civilisation giving russia place among european powers obliged them concede however reluctantly title greatness
stalin most ruthless despot russia known since peter also great westerniser
though carr made clear preferred historians refrain expressing moral opinions argue historian should find necessary then such views should best restricted institutions rather individuals
carr argued such approach better because focus individuals served provide collective alibi societies
carr used examples those united kingdom blamed appeasement solely upon neville chamberlain those germans argued nazi-era crimes work adolf hitler alone those united states blamed mc carthyism exclusively upon senator joseph mc carthy
carr's opinion historians should reject concepts like good evil making judgements events people
instead carr preferred terms progressive reactionary terms value judgements
carr's opinion historical event such collectivisation soviet agriculture early 1930 s led growth soviet heavy industry achievement goals first five year plan then collectivisation must considered progressive development history hence sufferings millions deaths caused collectivisation dekulakisation campaign holodomor justified growth soviet heavy industry
likewise carr argued suffering chinese workers treaty ports mines south africa late 19 th-early 20 th centuries terrible must considered progressive development helped push china towards communist revolution
carr argued china much better off under leadership mao zedong under leadership chiang kai-shek hence developments led fall chiang's regime 1949 rise power mao must considered progressive
finally carr argued historians objective capable moving beyond their narrow view situation both past present write historical works helped contribute progress society
end lectures carr criticized number conservative/liberal historians philosophers such hugh trevor-roper sir karl popper admiral samuel eliot morison sir lewis bernstein namier michael oakeshott argued progress world against them
carr ended book predication progress sweep away everything popper morison namier trever-roper oakeshott believed 20 th century just same way progress swept away catholic church's opposition galileo galilei's astronomical theories 17 th century
elaborating theme progress inevitably sweeping away old order things world 1970 article entitled marxism history carr argued exception mexican revolution every revolution last sixty-odd years led marxists
other revolutions carr counted revolutions cuba china russia half-revolution vietnam presumably reference then on-going vietnam war
together carr saw miserable condition third world comprised most world led carr argue marxism greatest appeal third world most likely wave future
carr expanded thesis progress being unstoppable force september 1978 stated think consider seriously hypothesis world revolution [the bolshevik revolution] first stage will complete downfall capitalism will prove revolt colonial peoples against capitalism guise imperialism
notes second edition history? carr remarked recent trends historiography
carr rise social history since first world war impact materialist conception history historical writings very strong
indeed might say serious historical work done period moulded influence
symptom change replacement general esteem battles diplomatic manoeuvres constitutional arguments political intrigues main topics history-'political history' broad sense-by study economic factors social conditions statistics population rise fall classes
increasing popularity sociology another feature same development attempt sometimes made treat history branch sociology
rise social history subject expense political history carr social history bedrock
study bedrock alone enough becomes tedious perhaps happened annales
you can't dispense
through carr himself insisted history social science regretted decline history discipline relative other social sciences saw part conservative trend
carr history preoccupied fundamental processes change
you allergic these processes you abandon history take cover social sciences
today anthropology sociology etc
history sick
then our society too sick
carr deplored rise structuralism
carr there structuralist approach carr called horizontal way understanding history analyses society terms functional structural inter-relation parts
against there carr called vertical approach analyses [society] terms come going
though carr willing allow structural approach advantages makes lot difference attracts [the historian's] main emphasis concern
depends partly no doubt temperament largely environment works
live society thinks change chiefly change worse dreads prefers horizontal view calls minor adjustments
repeating attack empirical approach history carr claimed those historians claimed strict empiricists like captain stephen roskill took just-the-facts approach resemble character named funes short story argentine writer jorge luis borges never forgot anything seen heard memory garbage heap thus funes very capable thought because think forget differences generalise make abstractions introduction second edition history? written shortly before death 1982 carr finished second edition carr proclaimed belief western world state despair writing cold war resumed redoubled intensity bringing threat nuclear extinction
delayed economic crisis set vengeance ravaging industrial countries spreading cancer unemployment throughout western world [carr referring recession early 1980 s here
scarcely country now free antagonism violence terrorism
revolt oil-producing states middle east brought significant shift power disadvantage western industrial nations [a reference part carr arab oil shock 1973–74 iranian oil shock 1979]
third world transformed passive positive disturbing factor world affairs
these conditions any expression optimism come seem absurd
carr went declare belief world fact getting better west decline world writing my conclusion current wave scepticism despair looks ahead nothing destruction decay dismisses absurd any belief progress any prospect further advance human race form elitism-the product elite social groups whose security whose privileges most conspicuously eroded crisis elite countries whose once undisputed domination over rest world shattered
claims carr made nature historical work history? proved very controversial inspired sir geoffrey elton write 1967 book practice history response defending traditional historical methods
elton criticized carr whimsical distinction historical facts facts past arguing reflected
extraordinarily arrogant attitude both past place historian studying
though elton praised carr rejecting role accidents history maintained carr's philosophy history merely attempt provide secular version mediaeval view history working god's master plan progress playing part god
response elton's book carr letter began warning suing libel
however libel threat just practical joke carr nobody before accused me having undergraduate oxford my solicitors might fear take low view
carr referring here sentence practice history elton written carr's knowledge ancient greece based fifty-year memories oxford undergraduate carr course attended cambridge
british historian hugh trevor-roper argued carr's dismissal might-have-beens history reflected fundamental lack interest examining historical causation
trevor-roper asserted examining possible alternative outcomes history far being parlour-game rather essential part historians' work
trevor-roper argued considering possible outcomes given historical situation historian properly understand period under study
trevor-roper's opinion looking possible outcomes sides historian properly understand history those historians adopted carr's perspective seeking understand winners history treating outcome particular set events possible outcome bad historians
review 1963 historische zeitschrift andreas hillgruber favourably carr's geistvoll-ironischer ironically spirited criticism conservative liberal positivist historians positive assessment history? came british philosopher w
walsh 1963 review endorsed carr's theory facts history facts past writing fact history toast breakfast today
walsh went write carr correct historians stand above history instead products their own places times turn decided facts past determined facts history
british historian richard j
evans credited history? causing revolution british historiography 1960 s
australian historian keith windschuttle critic carr noted regretfully history? proved most influential books ever written historiography there very few historians working english language since 1960 s read history? against carr's theory facts past facts history winschuttle another contender historical truth might proposition 'the united states defeated japan second world war
now something know simply historical record
no mere interpretation derived examination documents surrender signed aboard uss missouri tokyo harbour 1945
interpretation future generations might overturn after scoured nuances texts far undiscerned ideological meaning
fact united states defeated japan shaped very world us inhabited since 1945
relations states world economy employment market every industrial country consequences various ways historical truth
world itself confirms proposition
course e
carr might argue defeat japan mere 'fact' really interesting discussions interpretations historians make conclusions draw facts kind
well man's fact another man's conclusion
someone writing narrative history war pacific defeat japan very big conclusion indeed
there no event inherently confined status mere fact building block much larger conclusion
every fact itself conclusion every conclusion itself fact someone else's explanation
contribution theory international relations carr contributed foundation now known classical realism international relations theory
[citation needed] through study history work thucydides machiavelli reflection deep epistemological disagreement idealism dominant international relations theory world wars came up realism
book twenty years' crisis carr defined three dichotomies realism utopianism idealism derived machiavellian realism first place history sequence cause effect whose course analysed understood intellectual effort utopians believe directed imagination
secondly theory does utopians assume create practice practice theory
machiavelli's words good counsels whence ever come born wisdom prince wisdom prince good counsels
thirdly politics utopians pretend function ethics ethics politics
men kept honest constraint
machiavelli recognised importance morality thought there no effective morality there no effective authority
morality product power
