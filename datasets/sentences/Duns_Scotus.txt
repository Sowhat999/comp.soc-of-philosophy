august realism scotus generally considered realist opposed nominalist treated universals real
attacks position close later defended ockham arguing things common nature example humanity common socrates plato plutarch
univocity being followed aristotle asserting subject matter metaphysics being qua being ens inquantum ens
being general ens communi univocal notion first object intellect
metaphysics includes study transcendentals called because transcend division being finite infinite further division finite being ten aristotelian categories
being itself transcendental attributes being—one true good—which coextensive being each add something
[original research?] doctrine univocity being implies denial any real distinction essence existence
aquinas argued finite being
except god essence thing distinct existence
scotus rejected distinction
scotus argued cannot conceive something without conceiving existing
should make any distinction whether thing exists si est quid est never know whether something exists unless concept know exist
individuation scotus elaborates distinct view hylomorphism three important strong theses differentiate

scotus axiom stating individual exists dominating principle understanding reality
apprehension individuals intuitive cognition required gives us present existence non-existence individual opposed abstract cognition
thus human soul separated state body will capable knowing spiritual intuitively
formal distinction like other realist philosophers period such aquinas henry ghent scotus recognised need intermediate distinction merely conceptual fully real mind-dependent either
scotus argued formal distinction distinctio formalis parte rei holds entities inseparable indistinct reality whose definitions identical
example personal properties trinity formally distinct divine essence
similarly distinction 'thisness' haecceity thing intermediate real conceptual distinction
there also formal distinction divine attributes powers soul

august voluntarism scotus augustinian theologian
usually associated voluntarism tendency emphasize god's will human freedom philosophical issues
main difference aquinas' rational theology scotus' scotus believed certain predicates may applied univocally exactly same meaning god creatures whereas aquinas insisted impossible analogical predication employed word applied god meaning different although related meaning same word applied creatures
duns struggled throughout works demonstrating univocity theory against aquinas' analogy doctrine
metaphysical argument existence god duns scotus believes better construct metaphysical argument existence god rather common physical argument motion favored aquinas following aristotle
though version de primo principio most complete final version ordinatio proof usually offered
however de primo version fascinating worth looking wider understanding argument well scotus' metaphysical underpinnings argument god's existence shall base section article ordinatio version
let us briefly outline scotus’ argument
begins proof explaining there two angles must take arguing existence actually infinite being
first must approach view relative properties god second absolute properties god
relative properties those predicable god relation creation absolute properties those belong god whether chose create
under first heading relative properties scotus argues triple primacy efficiency finality pre-eminence
there shows primacy implies others finally there nature first efficient cause ultimate end most perfect nature
there subtle doctor discusses absolute properties god
first being intellectual volitional intellect will identical essence supreme nature
first being also infinite being
while discussing infinity god scotus resurrects anselm’s argument responds criticism anselm makes illicit leap concept reality
finally gives definite answer ‘yes’ question whether there exists actually infinite being
very next question ordinatio deals unicity nature thus proved exist
however de primo principio version concludes argument
since argument very long many parts shall content ourselves article stating premises existence first efficient cause assuming reader will follow citations read rest argument
proof conclusion efficient cause simply first such neither effect nor virtue something other itself cause effect ordinatio
43 runs something like something produced
2 produced either itself nothing another
3 nothing nothing causes nothing
4 itself effect never causes itself
5 therefore another call
6 return 2
produced either itself nothing another
ascending series will either continue infinitely finally reach something nothing prior
7 infinite ascending series impossible
therefore simply first efficient cause exists
scotus acknowledges two objections deals them accordingly
first begs question assuming first series
here argues while many admit infinite regress accidentally ordered series causes no philosopher admits infinite regress essentially ordered series
scotus explains differences two offers proofs conclusion infinity essentially order causes series impossible
second objected proof really demonstration since begins contingent premise
something produced contingent necessary
therefore proof proceeds contingent necessary premise
scotus says while true utterly manifest things produced effected
order respond scotus makes modal move reworks argument
now argues possibility production
possible something produced necessary proposition
there able conclude possible first efficient cause exists possible exists then does exist
assures us last claim will proved later argument
lectura proof scotus argues following way although beings different god actually contingent respect their factual existence nevertheless respect their possible existence
hence those entities called contingent respect their factual existence necessary respect their possible existence instance although “there exists man” contingent nevertheless “it possible exists” necessary because existence does include any contradiction
therefore “something different god possible” necessary because being divided contingent necessary
just necessity belongs necessary being virtue condition quiddity possibility belongs possible being virtue quiddity
first argument alternatively qualified notion ontological possibility then necessary propositions follows possible there something different god itself because then case possible nor nothing
therefore possible something else
either possible other agent acts virtue itself virtue something else being something else possible
then possible there first agent [is] possible exists then exists just proved before
there no infinite regress then argument once comes standstill
should fascinating argument leave reader search out argument
see especially http//www
illuminationism scotus argued against version illuminationism defended earlier century henry ghent
4 argued against sceptical consequences henry claimed follow abandoning divine illumination
scotus argued our thinking fallible way henry believed such illumination even principle ensure certain pure knowledge
those come together incompatible certainty then certainty cannot achieved
just premise necessary contingent nothing follows contingent conclusion something certain something uncertain coming together cognition no cognition certain follows ordinatio

immaculate conception perhaps most influential point duns scotus' theology defense immaculate conception mary
mary herself conceived without sin
time there great deal argument subject
general opinion appropriately deferential mother god seen how resolve problem christ's death stain original sin removed
great philosophers theologians west divided subject indeed appears even thomas aquinas sided those denied doctrine though thomists dispute
feast day existed east though east feast just conception mary since seventh century introduced several dioceses west well even though philosophical basis lacking
citing anselm canterbury's principle potuit decuit ergo fecit [i
god] appropriate therefore duns scotus devised following argument mary need redemption like other human beings through merits jesus' crucifixion given advance she conceived without stain original sin
god brought she never original sin 2 she sin instant 3 she sin period time being purged last instant
whichever these options most excellent should probably attributed mary
apparently careful statement provoked storm opposition paris suggested line 'fired france mary without spot' famous poem duns scotus's oxford gerard manley hopkins
scotus' argument appears pope pius ix's 1854 declaration dogma immaculate conception first moment her conception mary preserved free stain original sin view merits jesus christ
scotus' position hailed correct expression faith apostles
another scotus' positions also gained official approval roman catholic church doctrine universal primacy christ became underlying rationale feast christ king instituted 1925
during pontificate pope john xxiii recommended reading duns scotus' theology modern theology students
veneration long honored blessed order friars minor well archdioceses edinburgh cologne 19 th-century process started seeking recognition such holy see basis cultus immemorabilis
ancient standing
declared venerable pope john paul ii officially recognized liturgical cult effectively beatifying 20 march 1993
later reputation influence later medieval period owing scotus' early unexpected death left behind large body work unfinished unedited condition
students disciples extensively edited papers often confusing them works other writers many cases leading misattribution confused transmission
most thirteenth-century franciscans followed bonaventura influence scotus well arch-rival william ockham spread fourteenth century
franciscan theologians late middle ages thus divided so-called scotists ockhamists
fourteenth century followers included francis mayrone died 1325 antonius andreas died 1320 william alnwick died 1333 john bassolis died 1347 supposedly scotus' favourite student
sixteenth nineteenth centuries reputation suffered during english reformation probably due association franciscans
letter thomas cromwell visit oxford 1535 richard layton described how saw court new college full pages scotus's work wind blowing them every corner
john leland described oxford greyfriar's library 1538 just prior dissolution accumulation 'cobwebs moths bookworms'
despite scotism grew catholic europe
scotus' works collected many editions particularly late fifteenth century advent printing
school probably height popularity beginning seventeenth century during sixteenth seventeenth centuries there even special scotist chairs e
paris rome coimbra salamanca alcalá padua pavia
flourished well seventeenth century influence seen such writers descartes bramhall
interest dwindled eighteenth century revival scholastic philosophy known neo-scholasticism essentially revival thomistic thinking
twentieth century twentieth century saw resurgence interest scotus range assessments thought
hand scotus received interest secular philosophers such peter king gyula klima paul vincent spade others

known doctor subtilis because subtle distinctions nuances thinking
later philosophers sixteenth century less complimentary work accused sophistry
led word dunce developed name dunse given followers 1500 s becoming used somebody incapable scholarship
important question since 1960 s revolved over whether scotus' thought heralded change thinking nature 'being' change marked shift aquinas other previous thinkers question particularly significant recent years because come seen debate over origins 'modernity'
line argument first emerged 1960 s among popular french philosophers passing singled out duns scotus figure whose theory univocal being changed earlier approach aquinas shared predecessors
then 1990 historian philosophy jean-francois courtine argued time aquinas mid-thirteenth century francisco suárez turn seventeenth fundamentally new approach being developed scotus taking major part development
during 1990 s various scholars extended argument locate scotus first thinker succumbed heidegger termed 'onto-theology'
recent years criticism scotus become disseminated particular through writings 'radical orthodox' group theologians centred around john milbank catherine pickstock
