both published anonymously avoid any criticism might attach her being woman scholar allow work stand upon own merits
major stimulus her philosophical study arose her correspondence gottfried wilhem leibniz explored their respective theories including leibniz's work pre-established harmony dr cudworth's work relationship body soul
philosophy advocacy often touted lockean feminist scholars such jaqueline broad lois frankel cudworth's public works consisted mix her father's platonism lockean theories arguments her own proto-feminist ideals advocacy
cudworth criticised double-standard men women's moralities women's lack access higher education
thoughts reference vertuous christian life cudworth makes two important points regarding inferior education given women
first she argues giving inferior education women leaves them unfit able give their children proper education most children during time period still given early education their mothers education still much reserved those elite classes
cudworth writes “the improvements reason however requisite ladies their accomplishment rational creatures however needful them well educating their children their being useful their families yet rarely any recommendation them men foolishly thinking money will answer things most part regard nothing else woman marry … girls betwixt silly fathers ignorant mothers generally brought up traditionary opinions them their lives long instead reason
here cudworth argued benefit mankind should women allowed access higher education allowed them better educate their sons daughters advance reason society
secondly cudworth argued women should access education their children’s spiritual welfare their own well
she argued “women souls sav’d well men” being blessed rational thinking imperative women understood principles values behind their own religious beliefs
“they [women] perhaps sometimes regard religion exacts must believe such such things because word god requires put upon searching scriptures themselves see whether no these things
she argued woman's duty knowledge should grounded uncertain variable opinions men should instead able nurture their minds well their bodies form their own opinions spirituality
influence other philosophers cudworth's work correspondence many great philosophers enlightenment bound influence their resulting published works
most notably surmised cudworth influence locke's second revision essay concerning human understanding
locke worked various revisions treatise 1689 until death 1704 during time living mashams manor oates high laver
thus unlikely cudworth intellectual influence over these revisions
revision section power locke seems adopt many ideas ralph cudworth especially ideas contained unpublished manuscripts considered second third parts true intellectual system universe
however these manuscripts suspected cudworth's possession until death her older brother john cudworth 1726
however locke's apparent influence ralph cudworth's ideas cannot ignored lead historians believe damaris cudworth herself familiarity her father's works may influenced locke during second revision power
cudworth make parallels her father's ideas free will contained third manuscript appear her publication occasional thoughts without capacity creature act contrary will creator there no desert self-excellency any created being contrariety will god therefore permitted universe necessary result creaturely imperfection under greatest endowment created being capable having viz
freedom liberty action
indicating her father likely passed down many ideas regarding free will rejection determinism cudworth either directly through reading manuscripts indirectly her tutoring philosophical discourse
