deschooling society main article deschooling society book brought ivan illich public attention deschooling society 1971 radical critical discourse education practised modern economies
giving examples regards ineffectual nature institutionalized education illich posited self-directed education supported intentional social relations fluid informal arrangements universal education through schooling feasible
no feasible attempted means alternative institutions built style present schools
neither new attitudes teachers toward their pupils nor proliferation educational hardware software classroom bedroom nor finally attempt expand pedagogue's responsibility until engulfs pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education
current search new educational funnels must reversed search their institutional inverse educational webs heighten opportunity each transform each moment living learning sharing caring
hope contribute concepts needed those conduct such counterfoil research education--and also those seek alternatives other established service industries
— ivan illich last sentence makes clear title suggests—that institutionalization education tends towards institutionalization society ideas de-institutionalizing education may starting point de-institutionalized society
book critique—it contains suggestions reinvention learning throughout society lifetime
particularly striking call 1971 use advanced technology support learning webs
operation peer-matching network simple
user identify himself name address describe activity sought peer
computer send back names addresses those inserted same description
amazing such simple utility never used broad scale publicly valued activity
— ivan illich according contemporary review libertarian forum illich's advocacy free market education bone throat choking public educators
although important note illich's opposition merely publicly funded schooling libertarians schooling such disestablishment schools means free market educational services deschooled society fundamental shift
later asserted after deschooling what? 1973 'we disestablish schools deschool culture'
actually opposed advocates free-market education most dangerous category educational reformers
tools conviviality tools conviviality 1973 published two years after deschooling society
new work illich generalized themes previously applied field education institutionalization specialized knowledge dominant role technocratic elites industrial society need develop new instruments reconquest practical knowledge average citizen
[e]lite professional groups
come exert 'radical monopoly' such basic human activities health agriculture home-building learning leading 'war subsistence' robs peasant societies their vital skills know-how
result much economic development very often human flourishing 'modernized poverty' dependency out-of-control system humans become worn-down mechanical parts
illich proposed should invert present deep structure tools order give people tools guarantee their right work independent efficiency
tools conviviality attracted worldwide attention
resume published french social philosopher andré gorz les temps modernes under title freeing future
book's vision tools developed maintained community users significant influence first developers personal computer notably lee felsenstein
medical nemesis medical nemesis first published 1975 also known limits medicine illich subjected contemporary western medicine detailed attack
argued medicalization recent decades many life's vicissitudes—birth death example—frequently caused harm good rendered many people effect lifelong patients
marshalled body statistics show considered shocking extent post-operative side-effects drug-induced illness advanced industrial society
introduced wider public notion iatrogenic disease scientifically established century earlier british nurse florence nightingale 1820–1910
others since voiced similar views
concepts counterproductivity main notion ivan illich concept counterproductivity institutions modern industrial society impede their purported aims
example ivan illich calculated america 1970 s you add time spent work earn money buy car time spent car including traffic jam time spent health care industry because car crash time spent oil industry fuel cars
you divide number kilometres traveled per year you obtain following calculation 10000 km per year per person divided 1600 hours per year per american equals 6 km per hour
real speed car 3
7 miles per hour
specific diseconomy specific diseconomy another term illich used measure degree institutional counterproductivity occurring—referring exact degree example medical industry induces illness educational institutions induce ignorance judicial system perpetuates injustice national defense may make nation less secure
specific diseconomy increase means institution industry increasingly counterproductive original intentions
radical monopoly invented concept radical monopoly technical medium appears effective creates monopoly denies access other media
mandatory consumption medium uses lot energy example motorised transportation narrows fruition use value innate transit ability
radical monopoly mean dominance type product rather dominance brand
speak radical monopoly industrial production process exercises exclusive control over satisfaction pressing need excludes nonindustrial activities competition
