rise szasz's arguments szasz first presented attack mental illness legal term 1958 columbia law review
article argued mental illness no fact bearing suspect's guilt possession devil
1961 szasz testified before united states senate committee arguing using mental hospitals incarcerate people defined insane violated general assumptions patient-doctor relationship turned doctor warden keeper prison
szasz's main arguments szasz convinced there metaphorical character mental disorders uses psychiatry frequently injurious
set himself task delegitimize legitimating agencies authorities saw their vast powers enforced psychiatrists other mental health professionals mental health laws mental health courts mental health sentences
szasz critic influence modern medicine society considered secularisation religion's hold humankind
criticizing scientism targeted psychiatry particular underscoring campaigns against masturbation end 19 th century use medical imagery language describe misbehavior reliance involuntary mental hospitalization protect society use lobotomy other interventions treat psychosis
sum up description political influence medicine modern societies imbued faith science declared since theocracy rule god priests democracy rule people majority pharmacracy therefore rule medicine doctors
szasz consistently paid attention power language establishment maintenance social order both small interpersonal wider socio-political spheres struggle definition veritably struggle life itself
typical western two men fight desperately possession gun thrown ground whoever reaches weapon first shoots lives adversary shot dies
ordinary life struggle guns words whoever first defines situation victor adversary victim
example family husband wife mother child get along defines whom troublesome mentally sick?
[the one] first seizes word imposes reality other [the one] defines thus dominates lives [the one] defined subjugated may killed
main arguments summarized follows myth mental illness mental illness expression metaphor describes offending disturbing shocking vexing conduct action pattern behavior such schizophrenia illness disease
szasz you talk god you praying god talks you you schizophrenia
dead talk you you spiritualist you talk dead you schizophrenic
maintained while people behave think disturbing ways those ways may resemble disease process pain deterioration response various interventions does mean actually disease
szasz disease mean something people while behavior people
diseases malfunctions human body heart liver kidney brain while no behavior misbehavior disease disease
that's diseases
szasz cited drapetomania example behavior many society approve being labeled widely cited disease
likewise women bend man's will hysteria
thought psychiatry actively obscures difference behavior disease quest help harm parties conflicts
maintained calling people diseased psychiatry attempts deny them responsibility moral agents order better control them
szasz's view people themselves others mental illness best fake disease
diagnoses mental illness mental disorder latter expression called szasz weasel term mental illness passed off scientific categories remain merely judgments judgments disdain support certain uses power psychiatric authorities
line thinking schizophrenia name disease entity judgment extreme psychiatric social reprobation
szasz called schizophrenia sacred symbol psychiatry because those labeled long provided continue provide justification psychiatric theories treatments abuses reforms
figure psychotic schizophrenic person psychiatric experts authorities according szasz analogous figure heretic blasphemer theological experts authorities
according szasz understand metaphorical nature term disease psychiatry must first understand literal meaning rest medicine
true disease entity must first somehow capable being approached measured tested scientific fashion
second confirmed disease condition must demonstrate pathology cellular molecular level
genuine disease must also found autopsy table merely living person meet pathological definition instead being voted existence members american psychiatric association
mental illnesses really problems living
often like disease argued szasz makes medical metaphor understandable no way validates accurate description explanation
psychiatry pseudoscience parodies medicine using medical-sounding words invented especially over last hundred years
clear heart break heart attack spring fever typhoid fever belong two completely different logical categories treating other constitutes category error myth
psychiatrists successors soul doctors priests dealt deal spiritual conundrums dilemmas vexations problems living troubled people forever
psychiatry's main methods those conversation rhetoric repression religion
extent psychiatry presents these problems medical diseases methods medical treatments clients especially involuntary medically ill patients embodies lie therefore constitutes fundamental threat freedom dignity
psychiatry supported state through various mental health acts become modern secular state religion according szasz
vastly elaborate social control system using both brute force subtle indoctrination disguises itself under claims scientificity
patient malingerer according szasz many people fake their presentation mental illness
gain example order escape burden like evading draft gain access drugs financial support other personally meaningful reason
definition malingerer knowingly deceitful although malingering itself also called mental illness disorder
szasz mentions malingering many works mind explain many other manifestations so-called ″mental illness
″ those cases so-called ″patients″ something personally significant communicate—their problems living—but unable express via conventional means resort illness-imitation behaviour somatic protolanguage body language psychiatrists psychologists misguidedly interpreted signs/symptoms real illness
separation psychiatry state accept mental illness euphemism behaviors disapproved then state no right force psychiatric treatment these individuals
similarly state should able interfere mental health practices consenting adults example legally controlling supply psychotropic drugs psychiatric medication
medicalization government produces therapeutic state designating someone example insane drug addict
ceremonial chemistry 1973 argued same persecution targeted witches jews gypsies homosexuals now targets drug addicts insane people
szasz argued these categories people taken scapegoats community ritual ceremonies
underscore continuation religion through medicine even takes example obesity instead concentrating junk food ill-nutrition physicians denounced hypernutrition
according szasz despite their scientific appearance diets imposed moral substitute former fasts social injunction overweight considered moral order scientific advice claims
those thought bad insane people those took wrong drugs drug addicts medicine created category those wrong weight obesity
szasz argued psychiatrics created 17 th century study control those erred medical norms social behavior new specialization drogophobia created 20 th century study control those erred medical norms drug consumption then 1960 s another specialization bariatrics created deal those erred medical norms concerning weight body should
thus underscores 1970 american society bariatic physicians greek baros weight 30 members already 450 two years later
presumption competence just legal systems work presumption person innocent until proven guilty individuals accused crimes should presumed incompetent simply because doctor psychiatrist labels them such
mental incompetence should assessed like any other form incompetence
purely legal judicial means right representation appeal accused
death control analogy birth control szasz argued individuals should able choose die without interference medicine state just able choose conceive without outside interference
considered suicide among most fundamental rights opposed state-sanctioned euthanasia
2006 book virginia woolf stated she put end her life conscious deliberate act her suicide being expression her freedom choice
abolition insanity defense szasz believed testimony mental competence defendant should admissible trials
psychiatrists testifying mental state accused person's mind much business priest testifying religious state person's soul our courts
insanity legal tactic invented circumvent punishments church time included confiscation property those committed suicide often leaving widows orphans destitute
insane person such thing widow children successfully argued
legal mercy masquerading medicine according szasz
abolition involuntary hospitalization no should deprived liberty unless found guilty criminal offense
depriving person liberty own good immoral
just person suffering terminal cancer may refuse treatment should person able refuse psychiatric treatment
person's right drugs drug addiction disease cured through legal drugs social habit
szasz also argues favor drugs free market
criticized war drugs arguing using drugs fact victimless crime
prohibition itself constituted crime
argued war drugs leads states things never considered half century before such prohibiting person ingesting certain substances interfering other countries impede production certain plants e
coca eradication plans campaigns against opium both traditional plants opposed western world
although szasz skeptical merits psychotropic medications favored repeal drug prohibition
[citation needed] szasz also drew analogies persecution drug-using minority persecution jewish homosexual minorities
nazis spoke having jewish problem
now speak having drug-abuse problem
actually jewish problem name germans gave their persecution jews drug-abuse problem name give persecution people use certain drugs
szasz cites rep
james m
hanley referring drug users vermin using same metaphor condemning persons use sell illegal drugs nazis used justify murdering jews poison gas—namely persecuted persons human beings 'vermin
therapeutic state therapeutic state phrase coined szasz 1963
collaboration psychiatry government leads szasz calls therapeutic state system disapproved actions thoughts emotions repressed cured through pseudomedical interventions
17 thus suicide unconventional religious beliefs racial bigotry unhappiness anxiety shyness sexual promiscuity shoplifting gambling overeating smoking illegal drug use considered symptoms illnesses need cured
17 faced demands measures curtail smoking public binge-drinking gambling obesity ministers say must guard against charges nanny statism
nanny state turned therapeutic state nanny given way counselor
nanny just people counselors also tell them think feel
nanny state punitive austere authoritarian therapeutic state touchy-feely supportive even authoritarian
according szasz therapeutic state swallows up everything human seemingly rational ground nothing falls outside province health medicine just theological state swallowed up everything human perfectly rational ground nothing falls outside province god religion
515 faced problem madness western individualism proved ill prepared defend rights individual modern man no right madman medieval man right heretic because once people agree identified true god good brings guard members nonmembers group temptation worship false gods goods
496 secularization god medicalization good resulted post-enlightenment version view once people agree identified true reason brings guard against temptation worship unreason madness
496 civil libertarians warn marriage state psychiatry catastrophic consequences civilization
same vein separation church state szasz believes solid wall must exist psychiatry state
american association abolition involuntary mental hospitalization believing psychiatric hospitals like prisons hospitals psychiatrists subject others coercion function judges jailers physicians szasz made efforts abolish involuntary psychiatric hospitalization over two decades 1970 took part founding american association abolition involuntary mental hospitalization aaaimh
founding announced szasz 1971 american journal psychiatry american journal public health

relationship citizens commission human rights 1969 szasz church scientology co-founded citizens commission human rights cchr oppose involuntary psychiatric treatments
szasz served cchr's board advisors founding commissioner
keynote address 25 th anniversary cchr szasz stated should honor cchr because really organization first time human history organized politically socially internationally significant voice combat psychiatry
never done human history before
distancing any type religion 2009 interview aired australian broadcasting corporation szasz explained reason collaborating cchr lack involvement scientology well got affiliated organisation long after established critic psychiatry called citizens commission human rights because then organisation still organisation money access lawyers active trying free mental patients incarcerated mental hospitals whom there nothing wrong committed no crimes wanted get out hospital

nothing scientology
reception szasz strong critic institutional psychiatry publications very widely read
argued so-called mental illnesses no underlying physiological basis unwanted unpleasant behaviors
mental illness metaphor described problems people faced their daily lives labeled medical diseases
szasz's ideas little influence mainstream psychiatriatry supported behaviorial social scientists
sociologist erving goffman asylums skeptical psychiatric practices
concerned stigma social rejection associated psychiatric treatment might harm people
thomas scheff also sociologist similar reservations
russell tribunal summer 2001 szasz took part russell tribunal human rights psychiatry held berlin june 30 july 2 2001
tribunal brought two following verdicts majority verdict claimed there serious abuse human rights psychiatry psychiatry guilty combination force unaccountability minority verdict signed israeli law professor alon harel brazilian novelist paulo coelho called public critical examination role psychiatry
awards szasz honored over fifty awards including american humanist association named humanist year 1973 award greatest public service benefiting disadvantaged award given out annually jefferson awards 1974 martin buber award 1974 honored honorary doctorate behavioral science universidad francisco marroquín 1979 humanist laureate award 1995 great lake association clinical medicine patients' rights advocate award 1995 american psychological association rollo may award 1998 kendell's views kendell presents schaler 2005 critique szasz's conception disease contention mental illness mythical presented myth mental illness
kendell's arguments include following szasz's conception disease exclusively terms lesion
morphological abnormality arbitrary conclusions based idea represent special pleading
there non-psychiatric conditions remain defined solely terms syndrome e
migraine torticollis essential tremor blepharospasm torsion dystonia
szasz's scepticism regarding syndromally defined diseases—only relation psychiatry—is entirely arbitrary
many diseases outside purview psychiatry defined purely terms constellation symptoms signs natural history present yet szasz expressed any doubt regarding their existence
syndrome-based diagnosis problematic psychiatry without issue remaining branches medicine? syndrome-based diagnosis unsound account absence objectivity then must generally unsound psychiatry
szasz's ostensibly exclusive criterion disease morphological abnormality—i
lesion made evident post-mortem examination organs tissues—is unsound because inadvertently includes many conditions considered disease virtue fact don't produce suffering disability e
functionally inconsequential chromosomal translocations deletions fused second third toes dextrocardia
szasz's conception disease does distinguish necessary versus sufficient condition relation diagnostic criteria
branches medicine other psychiatry morphological abnormality per se considered sufficient cause make diagnosis disease functional abnormality necessary condition
szasz's criticism syndrome-based diagnoses divorced consideration history medicine
medicine general diseases defined terms multitude criteria these include morbid anatomy e
mitral stenosis cholecystitis histologically e
most cancers alzheimer's disease c infective organism e
tuberculosis measles physiologically e
myasthenia gravis e biochemically e
aminoaciduria e chromosomally e
trisomy 21 turner's syndrome f molecularly e
thalassemia g genetically e
huntington's disease cystic fibrosis h syndrome e
migraine torticollis essential tremor blepharospasm torsion dystonia most so-called mental disorders
objective definitions disease—specified through g—became possible through accumulation scientific knowledge development relevant technology
initially underlying pathology diseases unknown diagnosed terms syndrome—no lesion demonstrated post-mortem examination organs tissues szasz requires until later history e
malaria diagnosed solely basis syndrome until advent microbiology
strict application szasz's criterion necessitates conclusion diseases such malaria mythical until medical microbiology arrives point became real
regard szasz's criterion disease unsound virtue contradictory results
szasz's contention mental illness associated any morphological abnormality uninformed genetics biochemistry current research results etiology mental illness
genes essentially instructions synthesis proteins
hence any condition even partly hereditary necessarily manifests structural abnormality molecular level
regardless whether actual morphological abnormality identified condition hereditary component then biological basis
twin adoption studies strongly demonstrated heredity major factor etiology schizophrenia thus there must biological difference schizophrenics non-schizophrenics
relation major depressive disorder difference response euthymic depressed individuals antidepressant drugs tryptophan depletion demonstrated
these results addition twin adoption studies provide evidence underlying molecular—hence structural—abnormality depression
szasz contends strictly speaking disease illness affect body hence there no mental illness idea foundational szasz's position
actuality there no physical mental illnesses per se there diseases organisms persons
bifurcation organisms minds bodies product cartesian dualism became dominant late 18 th-century time notion insanity something qualitatively different other illnesses became entrenched
actuality brain body comprise integrated indivisible system no illness respects abstraction mind vs
body upon szasz's argument rests
there no illnesses purely mental purely physical
somatic pain itself mental phenomenon subjective distress produced acute phase response onset illness immediately after trauma
similarly conditions such schizophrenia major depressive disorder produce somatic symptoms
any illness lies somewhere within continuum poles mind body extrema purely theoretical abstractions unoccupied any real affliction
mind/body division persists purely pragmatic reasons forms no real part modern biomedical science
shorter's views shorter replied szasz's essay myth mental illness 50 years later published journal psychiatrist delivered plenary address international congress royal college psychiatrists edinburgh 24 june 2010—in recognition 50 th anniversary myth mental illness—with following principal criticisms szasz's critique implicitly premised conception mind drawn psychiatry early-mid 20 th century—namely psychoanalytic psychiatry—and szasz updated critique light later developments psychiatry
referent szasz's critique—freud's mind—is found historical record isolated islands psychoanalytic practice
extent szasz's critique does address contemporary biologically–oriented psychiatry irrelevant
certainly phrase mental illness occurs contemporary psychiatric lexicon merely legacy earlier psychoanalytic influence upon psychiatry term does reflect real belief psychiatric disease—shorter's preferred term—originates mind abstraction szasz rightly explains
szasz concedes so-called mental illnesses may neurological basis—but adds such biological basis discovered these so-called mental illnesses reclassified mental illnesses brain diseases vindicate position
shorter explains problem szasz's argument here contention biological psychiatry so-called mental illnesses actually brain diseases
modern psychiatry de facto dispensed idea mental illness
notion psychiatric disease mainly entirely psychogenic part biological psychiatry
there exists least prima facie evidence psychiatric illness biological basis szasz either ignores evidence attempts insulate argument such evidence effectively claiming no true mental illness biological basis
shorter cites hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis hpa dysregulation positive dexamethasone suppression test result shortened rapid eye movement sleep latency those melancholic depression examples evidence
further examples cited shorter include responsiveness catatonia barbiturates benzodiazepines

significance affective use body language—or generally language illness—can hardly exaggerated
part our social ethic ought feel sorry sick people should try helpful them
communications means body signs may therefore intended mainly induce following sorts feelings recipient aren't you sorry me now? you should ashamed yourself having hurt me so! you should sad seeing how suffer
[t]he flamboyant schizophrenic body feelings encountered today represent communications contexts specific social situations
their aim induce mood rather convey information
thus make recipient message feel pay attention me! pity me! scold me! forth
[c]hildren women often get their way tears their words fall deaf ears—and patients symptoms
point persons situations cannot make themselves heard means ordinary language—for example speech writing—they may try make themselves heard means protolanguage example weeping symptoms
come thus speak these silent not-so-silent cries commands pleas reproaches—that these endlessly diverse utterances—as many different mental illnesses! http//www
