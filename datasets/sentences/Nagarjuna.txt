writings there exist number influential texts attributed nāgārjuna though there many pseudepigrapha attributed lively controversy exists over authentic works
work scholars agree nagarjuna's mūlamadhyamakakārikā fundamental verses middle way contains essentials thought twenty-seven chapters
according view christian lindtner works definitely written nagarjuna mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā fundamental verses middle way śūnyatāsaptati seventy verses emptiness vigrahavyāvartanī end disputes vaidalyaprakaraṇa pulverizing categories vyavahārasiddhi proof convention yuktiṣāṣṭika sixty verses reasoning catuḥstava hymn absolute reality ratnāvalī precious garland pratītyasamutpādahṝdayakārika constituents dependent arising sūtrasamuccaya bodhicittavivaraṇa exposition enlightened mind suhṛllekha letter good friend bodhisaṃbhāra requisites enlightenment addition works mentioned above several others attributed nāgārjuna
there ongoing lively controversy over those works authentic
contemporary research suggest these works belong significantly later period either late th early 9 th century ce hence authentic works nāgārjuna
however several works considered important esoteric buddhism attributed nāgārjuna disciples traditional historians like tāranātha 17 th century tibet
these historians try account chronological difficulties various theories
example propagation later writings via mystical revelation

there much discussion whether work nāgārjuna someone else
étienne lamotte translated third work french felt work north indian bhikṣu sarvāstivāda school later became convert mahayana
chinese scholar-monk yin shun felt work south indian nāgārjuna quite possibly author
these two views necessarily opposition south indian nāgārjuna well studied northern sarvāstivāda
neither two felt composed kumārajīva others suggested
philosophy statue nagarjuna tibetan monastery near kullu india studying writings clear nāgārjuna conversant many śrāvaka philosophies mahāyāna tradition
however determining nāgārjuna's affiliation specific nikāya difficult considering much material lost
most commonly accepted attribution texts christian lindtner holds then clearly māhayānist philosophy holds assiduously śrāvaka tripiṭaka while does make explicit references mahāyāna texts careful stay within parameters set out śrāvaka canon
nagarjuna may arrived positions desire achieve consistent exegesis buddha's doctrine recorded āgamas
eyes nagarjuna buddha merely forerunner very founder madhyamaka system
david kalupahana sees nagarjuna successor moggaliputta-tissa being champion middle-way reviver original philosophical ideals buddha
sunyata nāgārjuna's major thematic focus concept śūnyatā emptiness brings together other key buddhist doctrines particularly anātman not-self pratītyasamutpāda dependent origination refute metaphysics contemporaries
nāgārjuna buddha early texts merely sentient beings selfless non-substantial phenomena dhammas without any svabhāva literally own-being self-nature inherent existence thus without any underlying essence
empty being independently existent thus heterodox theories svabhāva circulating time refuted basis doctrines early buddhism
because things arise dependently their own power depending conditions leading their coming existence opposed being
chapter 24 verse 14 mūlamadhyamakakārikā provides nagarjuna's most famous quotations emptiness co-arising sarvaṃ ca yujyate tasya śūnyatā yasya yujyatesarvaṃ na yujyate tasya śūnyaṃ yasya na yujyate possible emptiness possible
nothing possible emptiness impossible
part analysis emptiness phenomena mūlamadhyamakakārikā nagarjuna critiques svabhāva several different concepts
discusses problems positing any sort inherent essence causation movement change personal identity
nagarjuna makes use indian logical tool tetralemma attack any essentialist conceptions
nagarjuna’s logical analysis based four basic propositions things dharma exist affirmation being negation non-being things dharma exist affirmation non-being negation being things dharma both exist exist both affirmation negation things dharma neither exist nor exist neither affirmation nor negation say things 'empty' deny any kind ontological foundation therefore nagarjuna's view often seen kind ontological anti-foundationalism metaphysical anti-realism
understanding nature emptiness phenomena simply means end nirvana
thus nagarjuna's philosophical project ultimately soteriological meant correct our everyday cognitive processes mistakenly posits svabhāva flow experience
scholars such fyodor shcherbatskoy t
murti held nagarjuna inventor shunyata doctrine however recent work scholars such choong mun-keat yin shun dhammajothi thero argued nagarjuna innovator putting forth theory words shi huifeng connection emptiness dependent origination innovation creation nāgārjuna
two truths nāgārjuna also instrumental development two truths doctrine claims there two levels truth buddhist teaching ultimate truth paramārtha satya conventional superficial truth saṃvṛtisatya
ultimate truth nagarjuna truth everything empty essence includes emptiness itself 'the emptiness emptiness'
while murti 1955 interpreted positing nagarjuna neo-kantian thus making ultimate truth metaphysical noumenon ineffable ultimate transcends capacities discursive reason others such mark siderits jay garfield argued nagarjuna's view ultimate truth there no ultimate truth siderits nagarjuna semantic anti-dualist posits there conventional truths
hence according garfield suppose take conventional entity such table
analyze demonstrate emptiness finding there no table apart parts […]
conclude empty
now let us analyze emptiness […]
find? nothing table’s lack inherent existence
see table empty […] see table conventional dependent
articulating notion mūlamadhyamakakārikā nāgārjuna drew early source kaccānagotta sutta distinguishes definitive meaning nītārtha interpretable meaning neyārtha large kaccayana world supported polarity existence non-existence
reads origination world actually right discernment non-existence reference world does occur
reads cessation world actually right discernment existence reference world does occur
large kaccayana world bondage attachments clingings sustenances biases
such does get involved cling these attachments clingings fixations awareness biases obsessions nor resolved my self
no uncertainty doubt just stress arising arising stress passing away passing away
knowledge independent others
it's extent kaccayana there right view
everything exists extreme
everything doesn't exist second extreme
avoiding these two extremes tathagata teaches dhamma via middle
version linked found nikayas slightly different found samyuktagama
both contain concept teaching via middle extremes existence non-existence
nagarjuna does make reference everything quotes agamic text mūlamadhyamakakārikā
causality see also causality jay l
garfield describes nāgārjuna approached causality four noble truths dependent origination
nāgārjuna distinguished two dependent origination views causal process causes effects causes conditions
predicated two truth doctrine conventional truth ultimate truth held together both empty existence
distinction effects conditions controversial
nāgārjuna's approach cause means event state power bring effect
conditions refer proliferating causes bring further event state process without metaphysical commitment occult connection explaining explanans
argues nonexistent causes various existing conditions
argument draws unreal causal power
things conventional exist ultimately nonexistent rest middle way both causal existence nonexistence casual emptiness within mūlamadhyamakakārikā doctrine
although seeming strange westerners seen attack reified view causality
relativity nagarjuna also taught idea relativity ratnāvalī gives example shortness exists relation idea length
determination thing object possible relation other things objects especially way contrast
held relationship ideas short long due intrinsic nature svabhāva
idea also found pali nikāyas chinese āgamas idea relativity expressed similarly element light
seen exist account [in relation to] darkness element good seen exist account bad element space seen exist account form

influence according jay garfield nagarjuna 'titanic figure' history mahayana buddhism
inﬂuence mahayana buddhist world unparalleled tradition exceeds tradition inﬂuence any single western philosopher
degree taken seriously many eminent indian chinese tibetan korean japanese vietnamese philosophers lately many western philosophers alone justifies attention corpus

despite nagarjuna's radical critique very possibility having grounded knowledge pramana epistemological school dignaga dharmakirti dominated indian buddhist intellectual circles again without any explicit attempt answer nagarjuna's criticisms their agenda
aside few commentators nagarjuna's works identiﬁed themselves madhyamikas indian buddhist intellectual life continued almost nagarjuna never existed
today nagarjuna discussed western philosophers areas language logic
