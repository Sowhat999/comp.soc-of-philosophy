thought harman starts development work martin heidegger's concept tool-analysis being time
harman tool-analysis key discovery establishes groundwork taking seriously autonomous existence objects doing highlights deficiencies phenomenology due subordination objects their use relationship humans
harman considered part speculative realism movement nebulous grouping philosophers united two perspectives rejection anthropocentric philosophies access privilege perspective humans relation objects support metaphysical realism via rejection correlationism assumption post-kantian philosophy fellow speculative realist quentin meillassoux defines idea according ever access correlation thinking being never either term considered apart other
harman's object-oriented approach considers life objects fertile ground metaphysics works overcome anthropocentrism correlationism
according harman everything object whether mailbox shadow spacetime fictional character commonwealth nations
however drawing phenomenology does distinguish two categories objects real objects sensual objects intentional objects sets philosophy apart flat ontology bruno latour
direct access real objects withheld relations incommensurable our knowledge untranslatable any relational access any sort cognitive otherwise
knowledge real objects through indirect access such case other objects' knowledge each other anything else
way example harman explains fire burns cotton stupidly paying no heed color smell beautiful purity softness
fire interacts cotton insofar flammable
same holds relations
central harman's philosophy idea real objects inexhaustible police officer eating banana reduces fruit present-at-hand profile elusive depth monkey eating same banana parasite infecting gust wind blowing tree
banana-being genuine reality world reality never exhausted any relation humans other entities
harman 2005 74
because inexhaustibility claims harman there metaphysical problem regarding how two objects ever interact
solution problem introduce notion vicarious causation according objects ever interact inside intention also object
cutting across phenomenological tradition especially linguistic turn harman deploys brand metaphysical realism attempts extricate objects their human captivity metaphorically allude strange subterranean world vacuum-sealed objects-in-themselves comet itself monkey itself coca-cola itself resonate cellars being no relation reaches
expressing strong sympathy panpsychism harman proposes new philosophical discipline called speculative psychology dedicated investigating cosmic layers psyche ferreting out specific psychic reality earthworms dust armies chalk stone
harman does however unreservedly endorse all-encompassing panpsychism instead proposes sort polypsychism nonetheless must balloon beyond previous limits without quite extending entities
continues stating perceiving non-perceiving different kinds objects found same entity different times important point objects perceive insofar exist panpsychism proclaims
instead perceive insofar relate
harman rejects scientism account anthropocentrism them raindrops know nothing lizards know very little humans knowledgeable others
