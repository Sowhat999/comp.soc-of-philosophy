1225 gained benefice abbotsley diocese lincoln time deacon
period life scholarship divided
historians argue began teaching career theology oxford year whereas others recently argued used income ecclesiastical post support studies theology university paris
however there clear evidence 1229/30 teaching oxford periphery lector theology franciscans established convent oxford 1224
remained post until march 1235
grosseteste may also appointed chancellor university oxford
however evidence comes late thirteenth century anecdote whose main claim grosseteste fact entitled master students magister scholarium
same time began lecturing theology oxford hugh wells bishop lincoln appointed archdeacon leicester also gained prebend made canon lincoln cathedral
however after severe illness 1232 resigned benefices abbotsley leicester retained prebend
reasons due changing attitudes plurality benefices holding ecclesiastical position simultaneously after seeking advice papal court tendered resignations
angry response friends colleagues resignations took surprise complained sister closest friend franciscan adam marsh intentions completely misunderstood
master sacred page manuscripts theology latin grosseteste trained franciscans standard curriculum university theology
franciscan roger bacon most famous disciple acquired interest scientific method
grosseteste lectured psalter pauline epistles genesis least creation account possibly isaiah daniel sirach
also led disputations such subjects theological nature truth efficacy mosaic law
grosseteste also preached university appears called preach within diocese well
collected those sermons along short notes reflections long after left oxford now known dicta
theological writings reveal continual interest natural world major resource theological reflection ability read greek sources ever learned hebrew until became bishop lincoln
theological index tabula distinctionum reveals breadth learning desire communicate systematic manner
however grosseteste's own style far unstructured many scholastic contemporaries writings reverberate own personal views outlooks

dispute raged hotly 1239 1245 chapter launching appeal papacy
1245 while attending first council lyons papal court ruled favour grosseteste

liberties national church came conflict pretensions rome stood own countrymen
thus 1238 demanded king should release certain oxford scholars assaulted legate otto candidus

most observers noted personal animus bishop lincoln pope stop pope agreeing most grosseteste's demands way english church ought function
grosseteste continued keep watchful eye ecclesiastical events
1251 protested against papal mandate enjoining english clergy pay henry iii one-tenth their revenues crusade called attention fact under system provisions sum 70000 marks annually drawn england alien nominees rome
1253 upon being commanded provide own diocese papal nephew letter expostulation refusal pope himself commissioner master innocent through whom received mandate
text remonstrance given burton annals matthew paris possibly altered forger less respect grosseteste papacy
language violent bishop elsewhere employs
general argument papacy may command obedience far commands consonant teaching christ apostles should expected ecclesiastical reformer grosseteste's time
there much reason suspecting letter addressed nobles england citizens london community whole realm grosseteste represented denouncing unmeasured terms papal finance branches
even case allowance must made difference modern medieval standards decorum

through adam came close relations simon de montfort
franciscan's letters appears earl studied political tract grosseteste difference monarchy tyranny embraced enthusiasm bishop's projects ecclesiastical reform
their alliance began early 1239 grosseteste exerted himself bring reconciliation king earl
there no reason suppose political ideas montfort matured before death grosseteste nor grosseteste busy himself overmuch secular politics except insofar touched interest church
grosseteste realised misrule henry iii unprincipled compact papacy largely accounted degeneracy english hierarchy laxity ecclesiastical discipline
hardly termed constitutionalist

reputation legacy grosseteste already elderly man firmly established reputation became bishop
ecclesiastical statesman showed same fiery zeal versatility given proof academic career general tendency modern writers exaggerate political ecclesiastical services neglect performance scientist scholar
opinion own age expressed matthew paris roger bacon very different
contemporaries while admitting excellence intentions statesman lay stress upon defects temper discretion
see pioneer literary scientific movement merely great ecclesiastic patronised learning leisure hours first mathematician physicist age
anticipated these fields thought striking ideas roger bacon subsequently gave wider currency
bishop grosseteste university stone's throw away lincoln cathedral named after robert grosseteste
university provides initial teacher training academic degrees levels
2003 hosted international conference grosseteste honour 750 th anniversary death
works grosseteste number early works latin french while clerk see biography above including called chasteau d'amour allegorical poem creation world christian redemption well several other poems texts household management courtly etiquette
also number theological works including influential hexaëmeron 1230 s
also highly regarded author manuals pastoral care produced treatises dealt variety penitential contexts including monasteries parish bishop's household
however grosseteste best known original thinker work concerning today called science scientific method
1220 1235 host scientific treatises including de sphera
introductory text astronomy

account manifest prophecies christ contained therein
also number commentaries aristotle including first west posterior analytics aristotle's physics survived loose collection notes glosses text
moreover lot very interesting work pseudo-dionysius areopagite's celestial hierarchy translated both text scholia greek latin commentary science argued grosseteste played key role development scientific method
grosseteste introduce latin west notion controlled experiment related demonstrative science among many ways arriving such knowledge
although grosseteste follow own advice during investigations work seen instrumental history development western scientific tradition
grosseteste first scholastics fully understand aristotle's vision dual path scientific reasoning generalising particular observations universal law then back again universal laws prediction particulars
grosseteste called resolution composition
example looking particulars moon possible arrive universal laws nature
conversely once these universal laws understood possible make predictions observations other objects besides moon
grosseteste further both paths should verified through experimentation verify principles involved
these ideas established tradition carried forward padua galileo galilei 17 th century
important resolution composition become future western scientific tradition important own time idea subordination sciences
example looking geometry optics optics subordinate geometry because optics depends geometry optics prime example subalternate science
thus grosseteste concluded following very much boethius argued mathematics highest sciences basis others since every natural science ultimately depended mathematics
supported conclusion looking light believed first form things source generation motion approximately know biology physics today
hence since light reduced lines points thus fully explained realm mathematics mathematics highest order sciences
optic studies roger bacon's de multiplicatione specierum
diagram shows light being refracted spherical glass container full water
grosseteste's work optics also relevant continued roger bacon often mentioned indebtedness although there no proof two ever met
de iride grosseteste writes part optics well understood shows us how may make things very long distance off appear placed very close large near things appear very small how may make small things placed distance appear any size want may possible us read smallest letters incredible distances count sand seed any sort minute objects
