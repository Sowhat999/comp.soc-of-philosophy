mouse developed adult skin grafting original strain performed there no tissue rejection

work used dealing skin grafts required after burns
medawar's work resulted shift emphasis science immunology attempts deal fully developed immunity mechanism attempts alter immunity mechanism itself attempt suppress body's rejection organ transplants
theory senescence medawar's 1951 lecture unsolved problem biology published 1952 addressed ageing senescence begins defining both terms follows obviously need word mere ageing propose use 'ageing' itself just purpose
'ageing' hereafter stands mere ageing no other innuendo
shall use word 'senescence' mean ageing accompanied decline bodily faculties sensibilities energies ageing colloquially entails
then tackles question why evolution permitted organisms senesce even though senescence lowers individual fitness 2 there no obvious necessity senescence
answering question medawar provides two fundamental interrelated insights
first there inexorable decline probability organism's existence therefore terms reproductive value
suggests therefore follows force natural selection weakens progressively age late life because fecundity younger age-groups overwhelmingly significant producing next generation
happens organism after reproduction weakly reflected natural selection effect younger relatives
pointed out likelihood death various times life judged life tables indirect measure fitness capacity organism propagate genes
life tables humans show example lowest likelihood death human females comes age 14 primitive societies likely age peak reproduction
served basis three modern theories evolution senescence
