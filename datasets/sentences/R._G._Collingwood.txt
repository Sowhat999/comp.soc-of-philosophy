came major inspiration philosophy history english-speaking world extensively cited leading commentator louis mink ironically remark collingwood coming best known neglected thinker our time
collingwood held history studied same way natural science because internal thought processes historical persons perceived physical senses past historical events directly observed
suggested historian must reconstruct history using historical imagination re-enact thought processes historical persons based information evidence historical sources
collingwood pointed out fundamental difference knowing things present natural sciences knowing history
come know things present things natural sciences “real” things observed existence substance right now
problem coming know things history while past human actions actually really happened took place past
actions then no real existence substance point time historian studying them
based understanding events actions historians study already happened finished cannot actually observed
collingwood maintained historians must use their imaginations reconstruct understand past
because human events already taken place cannot observed argued must imagined
principles art collingwood held following croce works art essentially expressions emotion
portrayed art necessary function human mind considered collaborative activity
politics collingwood defended ideals called liberalism continental sense essence conception
idea community governing itself fostering free expression political opinions take shape within finding means reducing multiplicity opinions unity

mortimer wheeler review remarked seemed first trifle off beat should immerse himself much museum-like detail… felt sure incidental primary mission organise own thinking
however most important work contribution first volume oxford history england roman britain english settlements major part nowell myres adding second smaller part english settlements
book many ways revolutionary set out write story roman britain archaeological rather historical viewpoint putting practice own belief 'question answer' archaeology
result alluring influential
however ian richmond 'the general reader may discover too late major defect
does sufficiently distinguish objective subjective combines both subtle apparently objective presentation'
most notorious passage romano-british art says impression constantly haunts archaeologist like bad smell ugliness plagues place like london fog
collingwood’s most important contribution british archaeology insistence question answer archaeology excavations should take place unless there question answered
