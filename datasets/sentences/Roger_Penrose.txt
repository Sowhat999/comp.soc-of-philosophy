article followed copy sent escher
completing cyclical flow creativity dutch master geometrical illusions inspired produce two masterpieces
having become reader birkbeck college london having attention drawn pure mathematics astrophysics cosmologist dennis sciama then cambridge 1964 words kip thorne caltech roger penrose revolutionised mathematical tools use analyse properties spacetime
until then work curved geometry general relativity confined configurations sufficiently high symmetry einstein's equations soluble explicitly there doubt whether such cases typical
approach issue use perturbation theory developed under leadership john archibald wheeler princeton
other radically innovative approach initiated penrose overlook detailed geometrical structure spacetime instead concentrate attention just topology space most conformal structure since latter - determined lay lightcones - determines trajectories lightlike geodesics hence their causal relationships
importance penrose's epoque-making paper gravitational collapse space-time singularities result - roughly object such dying star implodes beyond certain point then nothing prevent gravitational field getting strong form kind singularity
also showed way obtain similarly general conclusions other contexts notably cosmological big bang dealt collaboration dennis sciama's most famous student stephen hawking
predicted view outside horizon black hole lit thin accretion disc local context gravitational collapse contribution penrose most decisive starting 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture effect any ensuing singularities confined within well-behaved event horizon surrounding hidden space-time region wheeler coined term black hole leaving visible exterior region strong finite curvature gravitational energy may extractable known penrose process while accretion surrounding matter may release further energy account astrophysical phenomena such quasars
following up weak cosmic censorship hypothesis penrose went 1979 formulate stronger version called strong censorship hypothesis
together bkl conjecture issues nonlinear stability settling censorship conjectures most important outstanding problems general relativity

penrose developed these ideas based article deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique 1938 english translation two basic types statistical distribution czech geographer demographer statistician jaromír korčák

made several conjectures c wch subsequently proved others smoothness real
simple terms believes singularity einstein's field equation big bang apparent singularity similar well-known apparent singularity event horizon black hole
latter singularity removed change coordinate system penrose proposes different change coordinate system will remove singularity big bang
implication major events big bang understood without unifying general relativity quantum mechanics therefore necessarily constrained wheeler–de witt equation disrupts time

emperor's new mind 1989 argues known laws physics inadequate explain phenomenon consciousness
penrose proposes characteristics new physics may specifies requirements bridge classical quantum mechanics calls correct quantum gravity
penrose uses variant turing's halting theorem demonstrate system deterministic without being algorithmic
example imagine system two states off
system's state given turing machine halts off turing machine does halt then system's state completely determined machine nevertheless there no algorithmic way determine whether turing machine stops
penrose believes such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come play quantum mechanical wave function reduction may harnessed brain
argues present computer unable intelligence because algorithmically deterministic system
argues against viewpoint rational processes mind completely algorithmic thus duplicated sufficiently complex computer
contrasts supporters strong artificial intelligence contend thought simulated algorithmically
bases claims consciousness transcends formal logic because things such insolubility halting problem gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent algorithmically based system logic reproducing such traits human intelligence mathematical insight
these claims originally espoused philosopher john lucas merton college oxford
penrose–lucas argument implications gödel's incompleteness theorem computational theories human intelligence widely criticised mathematicians computer scientists philosophers consensus among experts these fields seems argument fails though different authors may choose different aspects argument attack
marvin minsky leading proponent artificial intelligence particularly critical stating penrose tries show chapter after chapter human thought cannot based any known scientific principle
minsky's position exactly opposite believes humans fact machines whose functioning although complex fully explainable current physics
minsky maintains carry quest [for scientific explanation] too far seeking new basic principles instead attacking real detail
see penrose's quest new basic principle physics will account consciousness
penrose responded criticism emperor's new mind follow up 1994 book shadows mind 1997 large small human mind
those works also combined observations anesthesiologist stuart hameroff
penrose hameroff argued consciousness result quantum gravity effects microtubules dubbed orch-or orchestrated objective reduction
max tegmark paper physical review e calculated time scale neuron firing excitations microtubules slower decoherence time factor least 10000000000
reception paper summed up statement tegmark's support physicists outside fray such ibm's john
smolin say calculations confirm suspected along
'we're working brain that's near absolute zero
it's reasonably unlikely brain evolved quantum behavior'
tegmark's paper widely cited critics penrose–hameroff position
their reply tegmark's paper also published physical review e physicists scott hagan jack tuszynski hameroff claimed tegmark address orch-or model instead model own construction
involved superpositions quanta separated 24 nm rather much smaller separations stipulated orch-or
result hameroff's group claimed decoherence time seven orders magnitude greater tegmark's still well short 25 ms required quantum processing theory linked 40 hz gamma synchrony orch-or suggested
bridge gap group made series proposals
supposed interiors neurons alternate liquid gel states
gel state further hypothesized water electrical dipoles oriented same direction along outer edge microtubule tubulin subunits
hameroff et al
proposed ordered water screen any quantum coherence within tubulin microtubules environment rest brain
each tubulin also tail extending out microtubules negatively charged therefore attracts positively charged ions
suggested provide further screening
further there suggestion microtubules pumped coherent state biochemical energy
roger penrose university santiago de compostela receive fonseca prize
finally suggested configuration microtubule lattice might suitable quantum error correction means holding together quantum coherence face environmental interaction
last decade researchers sympathetic penrose's ideas proposed alternative scheme quantum processing microtubules based interaction tubulin tails microtubule-associated proteins motor proteins presynaptic scaffold proteins
these proposed alternative processes advantage taking place within tegmark's time decoherence
hameroff lecture part google tech talks series exploring quantum biology gave overview current research area responded subsequent criticisms orch-or model
addition recent 2011 paper roger penrose stuart hameroff gives updated model their orch-or theory light criticisms discusses place consciousness within universe
phillip tetlow although himself supportive penrose's views acknowledges penrose's ideas human thought process present minority view scientific circles citing minsky's criticisms quoting science journalist charles seife's description penrose handful scientists believe nature consciousness suggests quantum process

film brief history time think say universe purpose it's somehow just there chance
people think take view universe just there runs along it's bit like just sort computes happen somehow accident find ourselves thing
don't think that's very fruitful helpful way looking universe think there something much deeper
