representation anaximander leaning towards pythagoras left
anaximander son praxiades born third year 42 nd olympiad 610 bc
according apollodorus athens greek grammarian 2 nd century bc sixty-four years old during second year 58 th olympiad 547–546 bc died shortly afterwards
establishing timeline work now impossible since no document provides chronological references
themistius 4 th-century byzantine rhetorician mentions first known greeks publish written document nature
therefore texts amongst earliest written prose least western world
time plato philosophy almost forgotten aristotle successor theophrastus few doxographers provide us little information remains
however know aristotle thales also miletus precedes anaximander
debatable whether thales actually teacher anaximander there no doubt anaximander influenced thales' theory everything derived water
thing debatable even ancient greeks considered anaximander monist school began miletus thales followed anaximander finished anaximenes
3 rd-century roman rhetorician aelian depicts leader milesian colony apollonia black sea coast hence inferred prominent citizen
indeed various history iii 17 explains philosophers sometimes also dealt political matters
very likely leaders miletus sent there legislator create constitution simply maintain colony’s allegiance
theories anaximander's theories influenced greek mythical tradition ideas thales father philosophy well observations made older civilizations east[dubious discuss] especially babylonian astrologers
these elaborated rationally
desire find universal principle assumed like traditional religion existence cosmic order elaborating ideas used old mythical language ascribed divine control various spheres reality
common practice greek philosophers society saw gods everywhere therefore fit their ideas tolerably elastic system
scholars saw gap existing mythical new rational way thought main characteristic archaic period th 6 th century bc greek city states
because hesitate speak greek miracle
follow carefully course anaximander's ideas will notice there such abrupt break initially appears
basic elements nature water air fire earth first greek philosophers believed constituted universe represent fact primordial forces previous thought
their collision produced mythical tradition called cosmic harmony
old cosmogonies hesiod th 7 th century bc pherecydes 6 th century bc zeus establishes order world destroying powers threatening harmony titans
anaximander claimed cosmic order monarchic geometric causes equilibrium earth lying centre universe
projection nature new political order new space organized around centre static point system society nature
space there isonomy equal rights forces symmetrical transferrable
decisions now taken assembly demos agora lying middle city
same rational way thought led introduce abstract apeiron indefinite infinite boundless unlimited origin universe concept probably influenced original chaos gaping void abyss formless state mythical greek cosmogony everything else appeared
also takes notice mutual changes four elements
origin then must something else unlimited source create without experiencing decay genesis never stop
apeiron main articles apeiron cosmology matter § antiquity c
610 bc–c
322 bc refutation attributed hippolytus rome 5 later 6 th century byzantine philosopher simplicius cilicia attribute anaximander earliest use word apeíron ἄπειρον infinite limitless designate original principle
first philosopher employ philosophical context term archế ἀρχή until then meant beginning origin
became no longer mere point time source perpetually give birth whatever will
indefiniteness spatial early usages homer indefinite sea xenophanes 6 th century bc earth went down indefinitely apeiron
beyond imagination concept men
aristotle writes metaphysics iii 3–4 pre-socratics searching element constitutes things
while each pre-socratic philosopher gave different answer identity element water thales air anaximenes anaximander understood beginning first principle endless unlimited primordial mass apeiron subject neither old age nor decay perpetually yielded fresh materials everything perceive derived
proposed theory apeiron direct response earlier theory teacher thales claimed primary substance water
notion temporal infinity familiar greek mind remote antiquity religious concept immortality anaximander's description terms appropriate conception
arche called eternal ageless
hippolytus ? refutation i6 idk b2 anaximander principle things constituent substances nothing determined element such water thales' view
neither something halfway air water air fire thicker air fire subtle water earth
anaximander argues water cannot embrace opposites found nature — example water wet never dry — therefore cannot primary substance nor any other candidates
postulated apeiron substance although directly perceptible us explain opposites saw around
anaximander explains how four elements ancient physics air earth water fire formed how earth terrestrial beings formed through their interactions
unlike other pre-socratics never defines principle precisely generally understood e
aristotle saint augustine sort primal chaos
according universe originates separation opposites primordial matter
embraces opposites hot cold wet dry directs movement things entire host shapes differences then grow found worlds believed there many
anaximander maintains dying things returning element came apeiron
surviving fragment anaximander's writing deals matter
simplicius transmitted quotation describes balanced mutual changes elements whence things their origin thence also their destruction happens according necessity give each other justice recompense their injustice conformity ordinance time
simplicius mentions anaximander these poetic terms meaning used old mythical language
goddess justice dike keeps cosmic order
concept returning element origin often revisited afterwards notably aristotle greek tragedian euripides comes earth must return earth
friedrich nietzsche philosophy tragic age greeks stated anaximander viewed
coming-to-be though illegitimate emancipation eternal being wrong destruction penance
physicist max born commenting upon werner heisenberg's arriving idea elementary particles quantum mechanics seen different manifestations different quantum states same “primordial substance”' proposed primordial substance called apeiron
cosmology map anaximander's universe anaximander's bold use non-mythological explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes previous cosmology writers such hesiod
confirms pre-socratic philosophers making early effort demythify physical processes
major contribution history writing oldest prose document universe origins life often called father cosmology founder astronomy
however pseudo-plutarch states still viewed celestial bodies deities
anaximander first conceive mechanical model world
model earth floats very still centre infinite supported anything
remains same place because indifference point view aristotle considered ingenious false heavens
curious shape cylinder height one-third diameter
flat top forms inhabited world surrounded circular oceanic mass
anaximander's realization earth floats free without falling does need resting something indicated many first cosmological revolution starting point scientific thinking
karl popper calls idea boldest most revolutionary most portentous ideas whole history human thinking
such model allowed concept celestial bodies pass under earth opening way greek astronomy
illustration anaximander's models universe
left daytime summer right nighttime winter
origin after separation hot cold ball flame appeared surrounded earth like bark tree
ball broke apart form rest universe
resembled system hollow concentric wheels filled fire rims pierced holes like those flute
consequently sun fire see through hole same size earth farthest wheel eclipse corresponded occlusion hole
diameter solar wheel twenty-seven times earth twenty-eight depending sources lunar wheel whose fire less intense eighteen nineteen times
hole change shape thus explaining lunar phases
stars planets located closer followed same model
anaximander first astronomer consider sun huge mass consequently realize how far earth might first present system celestial bodies turned different distances
furthermore according diogenes laertius ii 2 built celestial sphere
invention undoubtedly made first realize obliquity zodiac roman philosopher pliny elder reports natural history ii
little early use term ecliptic knowledge work astronomy confirm must observed inclination celestial sphere relation plane earth explain seasons
doxographer theologian aetius attributes pythagoras exact measurement obliquity
multiple worlds according simplicius anaximander already speculated plurality worlds similar atomists leucippus democritus later philosopher epicurus
these thinkers supposed worlds appeared disappeared while born others perished
claimed movement eternal without movement there no generation no destruction
addition simplicius hippolytus reports anaximander's claim infinite comes principle beings themselves come heavens worlds several doxographers use plural philosopher referring worlds within often infinite quantity
cicero writes attributes different gods countless worlds
theory places anaximander close atomists epicureans century later also claimed infinity worlds appeared disappeared
timeline greek history thought thinkers conceptualized single world plato aristotle anaxagoras archelaus while others instead speculated existence series worlds continuous non-continuous anaximenes heraclitus empedocles diogenes
meteorological phenomena anaximander attributed phenomena such thunder lightning intervention elements rather divine causes
system thunder results shock clouds hitting each other loudness sound proportionate shock
thunder without lightning result wind being too weak emit any flame strong enough produce sound
flash lightning without thunder jolt air disperses falls allowing less active fire break free
thunderbolts result thicker violent air flow
saw sea remnant mass humidity once surrounded earth
part mass evaporated under sun's action thus causing winds even rotation celestial bodies believed attracted places water abundant
explained rain product humidity pumped up earth sun
earth slowly drying up water remained deepest regions someday go dry well
according aristotle's meteorology ii 3 democritus also shared opinion
origin humankind anaximander speculated beginnings origin animal life
taking account existence fossils[dubious discuss] claimed animals sprang out sea long ago
first animals born trapped spiny bark got older bark dry up break
early humidity evaporated dry land emerged time humankind adapt
3 rd century roman writer censorinus reports anaximander miletus considered warmed up water earth emerged either fish entirely fishlike animals
inside these animals men took form embryos held prisoners until puberty then after these animals burst open men women come out now able feed themselves
anaximander put forward idea humans spend part transition inside mouths big fish protect themselves earth's climate until come out open air lose their scales
thought considering humans' extended infancy survived primeval world same manner presently
other accomplishments cartography possible rendering anaximander's world map both strabo agathemerus later greek geographers claim according geographer eratosthenes anaximander first publish map world
map probably inspired greek historian hecataeus miletus draw accurate version
strabo viewed both first geographers after homer
maps produced ancient times also notably egypt lydia middle east babylon
small examples survived until today
unique example world map comes late babylonian tablet bm 92687 later 9 th century bce based probably much older map
these maps indicated directions roads towns borders geological features
anaximander's innovation represent entire inhabited land known ancient greeks
such accomplishment significant first appears
anaximander most likely drew map three reasons
first used improve navigation trade miletus's colonies other colonies around mediterranean sea black sea
second thales probably found easier convince ionian city-states join federation order push median threat away possessed such tool
finally philosophical idea global representation world simply sake knowledge reason enough design
surely aware sea's convexity may designed map slightly rounded metal surface
centre “navel” world ὀμφαλός γῆς omphalós gẽs delphi likely anaximander's time located near miletus
aegean sea near map's centre enclosed three continents themselves located middle ocean isolated like islands sea rivers
europe bordered south mediterranean sea separated asia black sea lake maeotis further east either phasis river now called rioni tanais
nile flowed south ocean separating libya name part then-known african continent asia
gnomon suda relates anaximander explained basic notions geometry
also mentions interest measurement time associates introduction greece gnomon
lacedaemon participated construction least adjustment sundials indicate solstices equinoxes
indeed gnomon required adjustments place another because difference latitude
time gnomon simply vertical pillar rod mounted horizontal plane
position shadow plane indicated time day
moves through apparent course sun draws curve tip projected shadow shortest noon pointing due south
variation tip’s position noon indicates solar time seasons shadow longest winter solstice shortest summer solstice
invention gnomon itself cannot attributed anaximander because use well division days twelve parts came babylonians
according herodotus' histories ii 109 gave greeks art time measurement
likely first determine solstices because no calculation necessary
other hand equinoxes correspond middle point positions during solstices babylonians thought
suda seems suggest very likely knowledge geometry became first greek accurately determine equinoxes
prediction earthquake philosophical work de divinatione 50 112 cicero states anaximander convinced inhabitants lacedaemon abandon their city spend night country their weapons because earthquake near
city collapsed top taygetus split like stern ship
pliny elder also mentions anecdote ii 81 suggesting came admirable inspiration opposed cicero associate prediction divination
interpretations bertrand russell history western philosophy interprets anaximander's theories assertion necessity appropriate balance earth fire water may independently seeking aggrandize their proportions relative others
anaximander seems express belief natural order ensures balance these elements there fire ashes earth now exist
greek peers echoed sentiment their belief natural boundaries beyond even gods operate
friedrich nietzsche philosophy tragic age greeks claimed anaximander pessimist asserted primal being world state indefiniteness
accordance anything definite eventually pass back indefiniteness
other words anaximander viewed
coming-to-be though illegitimate emancipation eternal being wrong destruction penance
