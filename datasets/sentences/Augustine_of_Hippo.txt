saw human being perfect unity two substances soul body
late treatise care dead section 5 420 ad exhorted respect body grounds belonged very nature human person
augustine's favourite figure describe body-soul unity marriage caro tua coniunx tua — your body your wife
initially two elements perfect harmony
after fall humanity now experiencing dramatic combat another
two categorically different things
body three-dimensional object composed four elements whereas soul no spatial dimensions
soul kind substance participating reason fit ruling body
augustine preoccupied plato descartes going too much details efforts explain metaphysics soul-body union
sufficed admit metaphysically distinct human composite soul body soul superior body
latter statement grounded hierarchical classification things those merely exist those exist live those exist live intelligence reason
like other church fathers such athenagoras augustine vigorously condemned practice induced abortion although disapproved abortion during any stage pregnancy made distinction early abortions later ones

slavery augustine led many clergy under authority hippo free their slaves act piety
boldly letter urging emperor set up new law against slave traders very much concerned sale children
christian emperors time 25 years permitted sale children because approved practice way preventing infanticide parents unable care child
augustine noted tenant farmers particular driven hire out sell their children means survival
famous book city god presents development slavery product sin contrary god's divine plan
god intend rational creature made image should dominion over anything irrational creation--not man over man man over beasts
thus righteous men primitive times made shepherds cattle kings over men
condition slavery result sin declared
astrology augustine's contemporaries often believed astrology exact genuine science
practitioners regarded true men learning called mathemathici
astrology played prominent part manichaean doctrine augustine himself attracted their books youth being particularly fascinated those claimed foretell future
later bishop used warn should avoid astrologers combine science horoscopes
augustine's term mathematici meaning astrologers sometimes mistranslated mathematicians
according augustine genuine students hipparchus eratosthenes common swindlers
creation see also allegorical interpretations genesis city god augustine rejected both immortality human race proposed pagans contemporary ideas ages such those certain greeks egyptians differed church's sacred writings
literal interpretation genesis augustine took view everything universe created simultaneously god seven calendar days like literal account genesis require
argued six-day structure creation presented book genesis represents logical framework rather passage time physical way — bear spiritual rather physical meaning no less literal
reason interpretation passage sirach 181 creavit omnia simul created things once augustine took proof days genesis taken non-literally
augustine also does envision original sin causing structural changes universe even suggests bodies adam eve already created mortal before fall
apart specific views augustine recognizes interpretation creation story difficult remarks should willing change our mind new information comes up
ecclesiology see also ecclesiology st
augustine carlo crivelli augustine developed doctrine church principally reaction donatist sect
taught there church within church there two realities namely visible aspect institutional hierarchy catholic sacraments laity invisible souls those church either dead sinful members elect predestined heaven
former institutional body established christ earth proclaims salvation administers sacraments while latter invisible body elect made up genuine believers ages known god
church visible societal will made up wheat tares good wicked people per mat
1330 until end time
concept countered donatist claim those state grace true pure church earth priests bishops state grace no authority ability confect sacraments
28 augustine's ecclesiology fully developed city god
there conceives church heavenly city kingdom ruled love will ultimately triumph over earthly empires self-indulgent ruled pride
augustine followed cyprian teaching bishops priests church successors apostles their authority church god-given
eschatology augustine originally believed premillennialism namely christ establish literal 1000-year kingdom prior general resurrection later rejected belief viewing carnal
first theologian expound systematic doctrine amillennialism although theologians christian historians believe position closer modern postmillennialists
mediaeval catholic church built system eschatology augustinian amillennialism christ rules earth spiritually through triumphant church
reformation theologians such john calvin accepted amillennialism
augustine taught eternal fate soul determined death purgatorial fires intermediate state purify those died communion church
teaching provided fuel later theology
epistemological views epistemological concerns shaped augustine's intellectual development
early dialogues [contra academicos 386 de magistro 389] both written shortly after conversion christianity reflect engagement sceptical arguments show development doctrine inner illumination
doctrine illumination claims god plays active regular part human perception opposed god designing human mind reliable consistently example descartes' idea clear distinct perceptions understanding illuminating mind human beings recognize intelligible realities god presents
according augustine illumination obtainable rational minds different other forms sense perception
meant explanation conditions required mind connection intelligible entities
augustine also posed problem other minds throughout different works most famously perhaps trinity viii
9 developed come standard solution argument analogy other minds
contrast plato other earlier philosophers augustine recognized centrality testimony human knowledge argued others tell us provide knowledge even don't independent reasons believe their testimonial reports
just war see also just war augustine asserted christians should pacifists personal philosophical stance
however peacefulness face grave wrong stopped violence sin
defence one's self others necessity especially authorized legitimate authority
while breaking down conditions necessary war just augustine coined phrase work city god
essence pursuit peace must include option fighting long-term preservation
such war pre-emptive defensive restore peace
thomas aquinas centuries later used authority augustine's arguments attempt define conditions under war just
mariology although augustine develop independent mariology statements mary surpass number depth those other early writers
even before council ephesus defended ever virgin mary mother god because her virginity full grace
likewise affirmed virgin mary conceived virgin gave birth virgin stayed virgin forever
natural knowledge biblical interpretation augustine took view literal interpretation contradicts science our god-given reason biblical text should interpreted metaphorically
while each passage scripture literal sense literal sense does mean scriptures mere history times rather extended metaphor
original sin see also original sin portrait philippe de champaigne 17 th century augustine taught original sin adam eve either act foolishness insipientia followed pride disobedience god pride came first
first couple disobeyed god them eat tree knowledge good evil gen 217
tree symbol order creation
self-centeredness made adam eve eat thus failing acknowledge respect world created god hierarchy beings values
fallen pride lack wisdom satan hadn't sown their senses root evil radix mali
their nature wounded concupiscence libido affected human intelligence will well affections desires including sexual desire
terms metaphysics concupiscence being bad quality privation good wound
augustine's understanding consequences original sin necessity redeeming grace developed struggle against pelagius pelagian disciples caelestius julian eclanum inspired rufinus syria disciple theodore mopsuestia
refused agree libido wounded human will mind insisting human nature given power act speak think god created
human nature cannot lose moral capacity doing good person free act act righteous way
pelagius gave example eyes capacity seeing person make either good bad use
like jovinian pelagians insisted human affections desires touched fall either
immorality e
fornication exclusively matter will
person does use natural desires proper way
opposition augustine pointed out apparent disobedience flesh spirit explained results original sin punishment adam eve's disobedience god
augustine served hearer manichaeans nine years taught original sin carnal knowledge
struggle understand cause evil world started before age nineteen
malum evil understood most concupiscence interpreted vice dominating person causing men women moral disorder
trapè insists augustine's personal experience cannot credited doctrine concupiscence
marriage experience though christian marriage celebration missing exemplary very normal no means specifically sad
brachtendorf showed augustine used ciceronian stoic concept passions interpret paul's doctrine universal sin redemption
view human soul also senses influenced fall adam eve prevalent augustine's time among fathers church
clear reason augustine's distancing affairs flesh different plotinus neo-platonist taught through disdain fleshly desire reach ultimate state mankind
augustine taught redemption
transformation purification body resurrection
augustine peter paul rubens authors perceive augustine's doctrine directed against human sexuality attribute insistence continence devotion god coming augustine's need reject own highly sensual nature described confessions
view writings apparently misunderstanding
augustine taught human sexuality wounded together whole human nature requires redemption christ
healing process realized conjugal acts
virtue continence achieved thanks grace sacrament christian marriage becomes therefore remedium concupiscentiae remedy concupiscence
redemption human sexuality will however fully accomplished resurrection body
sin adam inherited human beings
already pre-pelagian writings augustine taught original sin transmitted descendants concupiscence regarded passion both soul body making humanity massa damnata mass perdition condemned crowd much enfeebling though destroying freedom will
augustine's formulation doctrine original sin confirmed numerous councils
carthage 418 ephesus 431 orange 529 trent 1546 popes
pope innocent 401–417 pope zosimus 417–418
anselm canterbury established cur deus homo definition followed great 13 th century schoolmen namely original sin privation righteousness every man ought possess thus separating concupiscence augustine's disciples defined later luther calvin
1567 pope pius v condemned identification original sin concupiscence
augustine taught people predestined god salvation eternal sovereign decree based man's merit will
saving grace god bestows irresistible unfailingly results conversion
god also grants those whom saves gift perseverance none those whom god chosen may conceivably fall away
rebuke grace de correptione et gratia augustine written wills men saved while yet men saved may understood many ways mentioned other writings mine here will say thing wills men saved predestinated may understood because every kind men among them
free will included augustine's theodicy claim god created humans angels rational beings possessing free will
free will intended sin meaning equally predisposed both good evil
will defiled sin considered free once because bound material things lost difficult part resulting unhappiness
sin impairs free will while grace restores
will once free subjected sin's corruption
catholic church considers augustine's teaching consistent free will
often any saved wish
while god knows will won't saved no possibility latter saved their lives knowledge represents god's perfect knowledge how humans will freely choose their destinies
sacramental theology also reaction against donatists augustine developed distinction regularity validity sacraments
regular sacraments performed clergy catholic church while sacraments performed schismatics considered irregular
nevertheless validity sacraments depend upon holiness priests perform them ex opere operato therefore irregular sacraments still accepted valid provided done name christ manner prescribed church
point augustine departs earlier teaching cyprian taught converts schismatic movements must re-baptised
augustine taught sacraments administered outside catholic church though true sacraments avail nothing
however also stated baptism while does confer any grace done outside church does confer grace soon received catholic church
augustine study vittore carpaccio 1502 augustine upheld early christian understanding real presence christ eucharist saying christ's statement my body referred bread carried hands christians must faith bread wine fact body blood christ despite see their eyes
against pelagians augustine strongly stressed importance infant baptism
question whether baptism absolute necessity salvation however augustine appears refined beliefs during lifetime causing confusion among later theologians position
sermons baptized saved
belief shared many early christians
however passage city god concerning apocalypse may indicate augustine believe exception children born christian parents
statements jews against certain christian movements rejected use hebrew scripture augustine countered god chosen jews special people considered scattering jewish people roman empire fulfillment prophecy
rejected homicidal attitudes quoting part same prophecy namely slay them lest should last forget thy law psalm 5911
augustine believed jewish people converted christianity end time argued god allowed them survive their dispersion warning christians such argued should permitted dwell christian lands
sentiment sometimes attributed augustine christians should let jews survive thrive repeated author james carroll book constantine's sword example apocryphal found any writings
views sexuality augustine evil sexual immorality sexual act itself rather emotions typically accompany
christian doctrine augustine contrasts love enjoyment account god lust account god
augustine proper love exercises denial selfish pleasure subjugation corporeal desire god
pious virgins raped during sack rome innocent because intend sin
believed serpent approached eve because she less rational lacked self-control while adam's choice eat viewed act kindness eve left alone
augustine believed sin entered world because man spirit exercise control over woman flesh
augustine does however praise women their role society church
tractates gospel john augustine commenting samaritan woman john 41–42 uses woman figure church
according raming authority decretum gratiani collection roman catholic canon law prohibits women leading teaching being witness rests largely views early church fathers—one most influential being augustine bishop hippo
