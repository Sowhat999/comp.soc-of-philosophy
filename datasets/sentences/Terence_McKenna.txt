mc kenna died april 3 2000 age 53
library fire february 7 2007 mc kenna's library rare books personal notes destroyed fire burned offices belonging big sur's esalen institute storing collection
index maintained brother dennis survives though little else
thought psychedelics terence mc kenna advocated exploration altered states mind via ingestion naturally occurring psychedelic substances
example particular facilitated ingestion high doses psychedelic mushrooms ayahuasca dmt believed apotheosis psychedelic experience
however less enthralled synthetic drugs stating think drugs should come natural world use-tested shamanically orientated cultures
cannot predict long-term effects drug produced laboratory
mc kenna stressed responsible use psychedelic plants saying experimenters should very careful
must build up experience
these bizarre dimensions extraordinary power beauty
there no set rule avoid being overwhelmed move carefully reflect great deal try map experiences back onto history race philosophical religious accomplishments species
compounds potentially dangerous compounds sufficient doses repeated over time involve risks
library first place go looking taking new compound
also recommended often spoke taking called 'heroic doses' defined five dried grams psilocybin mushrooms taken alone empty stomach silent darkness eyes closed
stating taken way expect profound visionary experience believing slain power mushroom message becomes clear
although avoided giving allegiance any interpretation part rejection monotheism open idea psychedelics being trans-dimensional travel proposing dmt sent parallel dimension psychedelics literally enabled individual encounter 'higher dimensional entities' ancestors spirits earth saying you trust your own perceptions appears you entering ecology souls
mc kenna also put forward idea psychedelics doorways gaian mind suggesting planet kind intelligence actually open channel communication individual human being psychedelic plants facilitators communication
radical version biophysicist francis crick's hypothesis directed panspermia another idea mc kenna speculated psilocybin mushrooms species high intelligence may arrived planet spores migrating through space attempting establish symbiotic relationship human beings
postulated intelligence life intelligence may come here [to earth] spore-bearing life form pointing out think theory will probably vindicated
think hundred years people biology will think quite silly people once thought spores blown star system another cosmic radiation pressure believed few people position judge extraterrestrial potential because few people orthodox sciences ever experienced full spectrum psychedelic effects unleashed
mc kenna opposed christianity most forms organized religion guru-based forms spiritual awakening favouring shamanism believed broadest spiritual paradigm available stating think happened world prehistory religion experiential based pursuit ecstasy through plants
time very early group interposed itself people direct experience 'other
created hierarchies priesthoods theological systems castes ritual taboos
shamanism other hand experiential science deals area know nothing
important remember our epistemological tools developed very unevenly west
know tremendous amount going heart atom know absolutely nothing nature mind
either philosophically religiously expressed admiration marshall mc luhan alfred north whitehead pierre teilhard de chardin carl jung plato gnostic christianity alchemy while regarding greek philosopher heraclitus favorite philosopher
also expressed admiration works aldous huxley james joyce calling finnegans wake quintessential work art least work literature 20 th century science fiction writer philip k
dick described incredible genius fabulist jorge luis borges whom mc kenna shared belief scattered through ordinary world there books artifacts perhaps people like doorways impossible realms impossible contradictory truth vladimir nabokov mc kenna once become nabokov lecturer never encountered psychedelics
during final years life career mc kenna became very engaged theoretical realm technology
early proponent technological singularity last recorded public talk psychedelics age intelligent machines outlined ties psychedelics computation technology humans
also became enamored internet calling birth [the] global mind believing place psychedelic culture flourish
machine elves mc kenna spoke hallucinations while dmt claims met intelligent entities described self-transforming machine elves
there something like flower like chrysanthemum orange yellow sort spinning spinning then like pushed behind fell through chrysanthemum another place didn't seem like state mind seemed like another place
going place aside tastefully soffited indirect lighting crawling geometric hallucinations along domed walls happening there lot beings there call self-transforming machine elves
sort like jeweled basketballs dribbling their way toward me
they'd faces grinning didn't faces
assured me loved me me amazed give way astonishment
— terence mc kenna alien dreamtime stoned ape theory human evolution book food gods mc kenna proposed transformation humans' early ancestors homo erectus species homo sapiens mainly addition mushroom psilocybe cubensis diet event according theory took place 100000 bce believed species diverged homo genus
mc kenna based theory main effects alleged effects produced mushroom while citing studies roland fischer et al
late 1960 s early 1970 s
mc kenna stated due desertification african continent time human forerunners forced increasingly shrinking tropical canopy search new food sources
believed following large herds wild cattle whose dung harbored insects proposed undoubtedly part their new diet spotted started eating psilocybe cubensis dung-loving mushroom often found growing out cowpat
psilocybe cubensis psilocybin-containing mushroom central mc kenna's stoned ape theory human evolution
mc kenna's hypothesis low doses psilocybin improve visual acuity meaning presence psilocybin diet early pack hunting primates caused individuals consuming psilocybin mushrooms better hunters those resulting increased food supply turn higher rate reproductive success
then slightly higher doses contended mushroom acts sexually arouse leading higher level attention energy organism potential erection males rendering even evolutionarily beneficial result offspring
even higher doses mc kenna proposed mushroom acted dissolve boundaries promoting community bonding group sexual activities
consequently there mixing genes greater genetic diversity communal sense responsibility group offspring
these higher doses mc kenna also argued psilocybin triggering activity language-forming region brain manifesting music visions thus catalyzing emergence language early hominids expanding their arboreally evolved repertoire troop signals
also pointing out dissolve ego religious concerns forefront tribe's consciousness simply because power strangeness experience itself
therefore according mc kenna access ingestion mushrooms evolutionary advantage humans' omnivorous hunter-gatherer ancestors also providing humanities first religious impulse
believed psilocybin mushrooms evolutionary catalyst language projective imagination arts religion philosophy science human culture sprang
later idea given name 'stoned ape' hypothesis
mc kenna's stoned ape theory received attention scientific community criticized relative lack citation any paleoanthropological evidence informing our understanding human origins
ideas regarding psilocybin visual acuity criticized suggesting misrepresented fischer et al
published studies visual perception terms various specific parameters acuity
criticism also expressed due fact separate study psilocybin induced transformation visual space fischer et al
stated psilocybin may conducive survival organism
there also lack scientific evidence psilocybin increases sexual arousal even does does necessarily entail evolutionary advantage
others pointed civilisations such aztecs used psychedelic mushrooms least among priestly class didn't reflect mc kenna's model how psychedelic-using cultures behave example carrying out human sacrifice
although noted psilocybin usage aztec civilisation far removed type usage mc kenna speculating
there also examples amazonian tribes such jivaro yanomami use ayahuasca ceremoniously known engage violent behaviour
argued indicates use psychedelic plants does necessarily suppress ego create harmonious societies
archaic revival main themes running through mc kenna's work title second book idea western civilization undergoing called archaic revival
notion western society become sick undergoing healing process same way human body begins produce antibodies feels itself sick humanity collective whole jungian sense creating strategies overcoming condition dis-ease trying cure itself termed reversion archaic values
mc kenna pointed phenomena including surrealism abstract expressionism body piercing tattooing psychedelic drug use sexual permissiveness jazz experimental dance rave culture rock-n-roll catastrophe theory amongst others evidence process underway
idea linked mc kenna's stoned ape theory human evolution viewing archaic revival impulse return symbiotic blissful relationship believed humanity once psilocybin mushroom
differentiating idea new age term felt trivialized significance next phase human evolution mc kenna stated new age essentially humanistic psychology '80 s-style addition neo-shamanism channeling crystal herbal healing
archaic revival much larger global phenomenon assumes recovering social forms late neolithic reaches far back 20 th century freud surrealism abstract expressionism even phenomenon like national socialism negative force
stress ritual organized activity race/ancestor-consciousness these themes worked out throughout entire 20 th century archaic revival expression
novelty theory timewave zero timewave zero redirects here
album dutch aggrotech band grendel see timewave zero album
novelty theory pseudoscientific idea purports predict ebb flow novelty universe inherent quality time
proposing time constant various qualities tending toward either habit novelty
habit context thought entropic repetitious conservative novelty creative disjunctive progressive phenomena
mc kenna's idea universe engine designed production conservation novelty novelty increases does complexity
each level complexity achieved becoming platform further ascent complexity
64 hexagrams king wen sequence ching
basis theory originally conceived mid-1970 s after mc kenna's experiences psilocybin mushrooms chorrera amazon led closely study king wen sequence ching
asian taoism philosophy concept opposing phenomena represented yin yang
both present everything yet amount influence each varies over time
individual lines ching made up both yin broken lines yang solid lines
examining king wen sequence 64 hexagrams mc kenna noticed pattern
analysed degree difference each successive hexagram claims found statistical anomaly believed suggested king wen sequence intentionally constructed sequence hexagrams ordered highly structured artificial way pattern codified nature time’s flow world
degrees difference numerical values mc kenna worked out mathematical wave form based 384 lines change make up 64 hexagrams
able graph data became novelty time wave
screenshot timewave zero software written peter meyer showing timewave 25 years preceding zero date december 21
peter meyer collaboration mc kenna studied improved foundations novelty theory working out mathematical formula developing timewave zero software enabling them graph explore dynamics computer
graph fractal exhibited pattern given small section wave found identical form larger section wave
mc kenna called fractal modeling time temporal resonance proposing implied larger intervals occurring long ago contained same amount information shorter recent intervals
suggested up-and-down pattern wave shows ongoing wavering habit novelty respectively
each successive iteration trending increasing level towards infinite novelty
according novelty theory pattern time itself speeding up requirement theory infinite novelty will reached specific date
mc kenna suspected notable events history identified help locate time wave's end date attempted find best-fit placement matching graph data field human history
last harmonic wave duration 67
29 years
population growth peak oil pollution statistics factors pointed early twenty-first century end date looking extremely novel event human history signal final phase begun mc kenna picked dropping atomic bomb hiroshima
worked out graph reaching zero mid-november
later discovered end 13 th baktun maya calendar correlated western maya scholars december 21 2012[note a] adopted their end date instead
[note b] mc kenna saw universe relation novelty theory having teleological attractor end time increases interconnectedness eventually reach singularity infinite complexity
also frequently referred transcendental object end time
describing model universe stated universe being pushed behind
universe being pulled future toward goal inevitable marble reaching bottom bowl you release up near rim
you you know marble will roll down side bowl down down down until eventually comes rest lowest energy state bottom bowl
that's precisely my model human history
i'm suggesting universe pulled toward complex attractor exists ahead us time our ever-accelerating speed through phenomenal world connectivity novelty based fact now very very close attractor
therefore according mc kenna's final interpretation data positioning graph december 21 unique position time maximum novelty experienced
event described concrescence tightening 'gyre' everything flowing together
speculating laws physics obviated universe disappears left tightly bound plenum monad able express itself itself rather able cast shadow physis reflection

novelty theory considered pseudoscience
among criticisms use numerology derive dates important events world history arbitrary rather calculated end date time wave apparent adjustment eschaton november december order coincide maya calendar
other purported dates fit actual time frames date claimed emergence homo sapiens inaccurate 70000 years existence ancient sumer egyptian civilisations contradict date gave beginning historical time
projected dates criticised having seemingly arbitrary labels such height age mammals mc kenna's analysis historical events criticised having eurocentric cultural bias
watkins objection 1994 british mathematician mathew watkins exeter university then cambridge ph student conduct mathematical analysis time wave
watkins claimed there various mathematical flaws construction wave
