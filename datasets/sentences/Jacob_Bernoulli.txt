27 december 1654] 16 august 1705 many prominent mathematicians bernoulli family
early proponent leibnizian calculus sided leibniz during leibniz–newton calculus controversy
known numerous contributions calculus along brother johann founders calculus variations

following father's wish studied theology entered ministry
contrary desires parents[citation needed] also studied mathematics astronomy
traveled throughout europe 1676 1682 learning latest discoveries mathematics sciences under leading figures time
included work johannes hudde robert boyle robert hooke
during time also produced incorrect theory comets
bernoulli returned switzerland began teaching mechanics university basel 1683
1684 married judith stupanus two children
during decade also began fertile research career
travels allowed establish correspondence many leading mathematicians scientists era maintained throughout life
during time studied new discoveries mathematics including christiaan huygens's de ratiociniis aleae ludo descartes' geometrie frans van schooten's supplements
also studied isaac barrow john wallis leading interest infinitesimal geometry
apart these 1684 1689 many results make up ars conjectandi discovered
appointed professor mathematics university basel 1687 remaining position rest life
time begun tutoring brother johann bernoulli mathematical topics
two brothers began study calculus presented leibniz 1684 paper differential calculus nova methodus pro maximis et minimis published acta eruditorum
also studied publications von tschirnhaus
must understood leibniz's publications calculus very obscure mathematicians time bernoullis first try understand apply leibniz's theories
jacob collaborated brother various applications calculus
however atmosphere collaboration two brothers turned rivalry johann's own mathematical genius began mature both them attacking each other print posing difficult mathematical challenges test each other's skills

important works jacob bernoulli's grave
jacob bernoulli's first important contributions pamphlet parallels logic algebra published 1685 work probability 1685 geometry 1687
geometry result gave construction divide any triangle four equal parts two perpendicular lines
1689 published important work infinite series published law large numbers probability theory
jacob bernoulli published five treatises infinite series 1682 1704 first two these contained many results such fundamental result diverges bernoulli believed new actually proved mengoli 40 years earlier
bernoulli find closed form show converged finite limit less 2
euler first find sum series 1737
bernoulli also studied exponential series came out examining compound interest
may 1690 paper published acta eruditorum jacob bernoulli showed problem determining isochrone equivalent solving first-order nonlinear differential equation
isochrone curve constant descent curve along particle will descend under gravity any point bottom exactly same time no matter starting point
studied huygens 1687 leibniz 1689
after finding differential equation bernoulli then solved now call separation variables
jacob bernoulli's paper 1690 important history calculus since term integral appears first time integration meaning
1696 bernoulli solved equation now called bernoulli differential equation jacob bernoulli also discovered general method determine evolutes curve envelope circles curvature
also investigated caustic curves particular studied these associated curves parabola logarithmic spiral epicycloids around 1692
lemniscate bernoulli first conceived jacob bernoulli 1694
1695 investigated drawbridge problem seeks curve required weight sliding along cable keeps drawbridge balanced
jacob bernoulli's most original work ars conjectandi published basel 1713 eight years after death
work incomplete time death still work greatest significance theory probability
book bernoulli reviewed work others probability particular work van schooten leibniz prestet
bernoulli numbers appear book discussion exponential series
many examples given how much expect win playing various games chance
term bernoulli trial resulted work
there interesting thoughts probability really
probability measurable degree certainty necessity chance moral versus mathematical expectation priori posteriori probability expectation winning players divided according dexterity regard available arguments their valuation their calculable evaluation law large numbers
bernoulli most significant promoters formal methods higher analysis
astuteness elegance seldom found method presentation expression there maximum integrity
discovery mathematical constant e 1683 bernoulli discovered constant e studying question compound interest required find value following expression fact e example account starts $1
00 pays 100 percent interest per year
interest credited once end year value $2
00 interest computed added twice year $1 multiplied
5 twice yielding $1
5² = $2
compounding quarterly yields $1
254 = $2
compounding monthly yields $1
12 = $2
bernoulli noticed sequence approaches limit force interest smaller compounding intervals
compounding weekly yields $2
while compounding daily yields $2
just two cents
using n number compounding intervals interest 100%/n each interval limit large n number euler later named e continuous compounding account value will reach $2
generally account starts $1 yields 1+r dollars simple interest will yield e r dollars continuous compounding
