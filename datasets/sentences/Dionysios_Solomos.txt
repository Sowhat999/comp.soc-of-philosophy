rest works remained incomplete
solomos constantly editing works striving towards total perfection form making efforts get rid anything excessive destroyed their essential lyrical substance
manuscripts comprise engrossed works contrary reveal stages editing without their latest version being final
first poet conceptualized draft poem written italian prose after used start editing greek version
many verses saved form alternative versions often wrong order incomplete many gaps
poet often used write verses different poems same piece paper
poem 'the cretan' 1833 written cretan revolution most famous poems
highly fragmented however adds tormented atmosphere dramatic monologue because speaker beggar whose life torn apart emotional turmoil entire family killed turks
faithful student solomos iakovos polylas affronted many difficulties undertook publication teacher's work long awaited ionian islands also rest greece
first polylas ask permission poet's brother dimitrios order able study poet's manuscripts
after arrange scattered material written poet's difficult decipher handwriting present much possible complete coherent work
polylas piled arranged material choosing verses thought closest meaning poet mind
sometimes polylas added verses heard solomos recite down alternative versions
1859 polylas published work solomos under title apanta ta evriskomena- omnibus works found accompanying work exceptional introduction stated poet's manuscripts their definitive form lost
attempt interpret fragmented works form solomos' work presented first edition source disappointment because time work's value appreciated
polylas prolegomena stressed major manuscripts poems' final version either lost destroyed
people assumed works may stolen solomos' servant poet's brother dimitrios even poet himself destroyed them
beginning 20 th century made clear no manuscripts existed solomos completed poems
first attempts interpret fragmented nature poet's work mostly based theories having nothing texts themselves difficulty complete works thought due lack appropriate intellectual atmosphere provide solomos motivation complete works due lack adequate literary tradition poet followed
fragmentation solomos' work also attributed psychological factors such poet's alcoholism lack compositive capability negative effects 1833–1838 trial solomos' perfectionism feeling dissatisfaction
other scholars underlined however great extent solomos care completion poems
phrase attributed poet illustrative lampros will remain abstract because whole poem does reach height days
linos politis notes fragmentary nature free besieged want care incorporate these lyrical pieces narrative group [
stuck pure lyrical expression without regard non-lyrical linking substance thus advancing [
conquest 'pure' lyrical sphere long before time
detected something similar kritikos too same thing applied rest 'fragmented' works
later solomos considered several poets critics forerunner pure poetry fragmented nature work disturb any contrary considered advantage
during last decade attempts made associate incomplete solomian works fragmentary works romantic literature such kubla khan coleridge giaour lord byron heinrich von oftendingen novalis even though interpretation accepted scholars
publication issue 1920–1930 issue arose concerning publication works included iakovos polylas' edition such woman zakynthos satirical gallows several italian sonnets published k
kairofylas 1927
academy athens decided publish solomos' poems accompanied critical edition n
tomadakis thus contributing discussion whether genuine linos politis favor critical edition solomos' works best
critical edition never published two classical scholars prepared easy use editions poems aiming wider range readers
1964 linos politis published poet's manuscripts using photographic reprint typographical transcription
edition constitutes turn-point research solomian works because poet's way work revealed also because scholars opportunity study poet's editing phases maybe even propose new editions
contemporary editing attempts solomic work divided two categories analytical edition reveals successive editing stages every poem different versions such politis proposed intended realize synthetical edition presents work logical sequence completion form excluding verses abstracts no fulfill these criteria
sample synthetical edition stylianos alexiou 1994 strongly criticized supporters analytical approach
surviving works death sadly poet's work death mostly unfinished fragments edited published friend fellow poet iakovos polylas
whether solomos never satisfied work kept little whether large parts manuscripts lost something polylas implies whether difficulties fleshing out ambitious structure planned works clear fragments show huge disconnect intention surviving work cretan begins fragment canto 18 ends canto none them complete lambros conceived least 38 cantos them prose summary survives shortest poetic fragment consisting single line longest containing 33 stanzas second draft free besieged consists 61 fragments 27 single lines seven two lines two half-lines
