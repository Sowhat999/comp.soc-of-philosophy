1962 pamphlet revisionism brainwashing barnes claimed there lack any serious opposition concerted challenge atrocity stories other modes defamation german national character conduct
barnes view there failure point out atrocities allies brutal painful mortal numerous most extreme allegations made against germans

1964 article entitled zionist fraud published american mercury barnes courageous author [rassinier] lays chief blame misrepresentation those whom must call swindlers crematoria israeli politicians derive billions marks nonexistent mythical imaginary cadavers whose numbers reckoned unusually distorted dishonest manner
1964 barnes rassinier met became friends

1966 essay revisionism key peace barnes even accept most extreme exaggerated indictment hitler national socialists their activities after 1939 made anybody fit remain outside mental hospital most alarmingly easy demonstrate atrocities allies same period numerous victims carried out most part methods brutal painful then alleged extermination gas ovens
emphasis original
1967 pamphlet public stake revisionism barnes historical blackout regards world war ii become smotherout result trial adolf eichmann
writing eichmann trial 1961 barnes trial showed almost adolescent gullibility excitability part americans relative german wartime crimes real alleged emphasis original

barnes described expulsion germans eastern europe final solution german people
writing expulsion ethnic germans sudetenland region czechoslovakia 1945–46 claimed least four million them perished process butchery starvation disease

barnes certain unnamed court historians guilty ensuring allied war crimes never cogently frankly placed over against doings real alleged auschwitz
barnes acknowledged there concentration camps nazi germany denied there ever death camps
barnes court historians forced revisionists admit there no death camps evidence gas chambers death camps manufactured
barnes deemed important today whether hitler started war 1939 whether roosevelt responsible pearl harbour number prisoners allegedly done death concentration camps operated germany during war
