views atheism criticized presumption atheism
notion atheism should one's default position evaluating arguments over existence god
argues such position rigs rules since atheism just much claim knowledge theism
natural default position agnosticism
copan cites atheists such baggini flew arguing atheism mere lack belief rejection belief god gods
argues atheists often slide defending agnosticism asked reasons their view
suggests scientific naturalists will argue claims knowledge scientifically verifiable otherwise meaningless
copan argues such position commits fallacy exemplified horton hears
you cannot see hear feel something does exist
copan argues position arbitrary philosophical rather scientific pronouncement
also argues position scientific naturalist self-refuting because scientism itself cannot scientifically verified
copan also believes belief god generally psychological crutch claiming argument christianity wish fulfillment itself falls victim number fallacies
freud himself admitted oskar pfister psychoanalysis religion no clinical evidence merely freud's personal views
copan also argues odd arbitrary claim whatever brings comfort solace false
notes comforting father figure while unique biblical faith heart other world religions
copan also notes wish fulfillment argument against christianity classic example genetic fallacy claiming because explain how belief arose belief therefore false
presuppositionalism copan also critic presuppositionalism arguing christians use common ground engage non-christians debate
argues presuppositionalism begs question
assumes god exists order argue god exists
instead christians begin dialogues non-christians common ground such law non-contradiction
copan uses genesis 96 make point
claims image god completely destroyed fall meaning non-christians respond general revelation arguments cosmology history well personal testimony living godly life
ultimately copan argues presuppositionalism confuses private knowledge god public proclamation argument god
epistemic certainty god's existence private experience still appeal public evidence persuade others fact
old testament ethics copan known defense ethics old testament particularly divine command morality
warfare argues books joshua judges literarily connected therefore need read light another
book judges demonstrates military engagement
sweeping words like “all” “young old” “man woman” however stock expressions totality — even women children present
stereotypical ancient near east language “all” people describes attacks turn out military forts garrisons containing combatants — general population includes women children
copan states no archaeological evidence civilian populations jericho ai
first glance appears joshua captured land defeated kings destroyed canaanites
joshua later refers nations “remain among you” warns israel mention swear serve bow down their gods indicating fulfill command yet literally obliterate canaanite population
copan states joshua uses ancient conventional warfare rhetoric
notes many other ancient near east military accounts full bravado exaggeration depicting total devastation
ancient near east readers knew massive hyperbole literally true
slavery copan argues biblical concept slavery misunderstood
says should compare hebrew debt-servanthood many translations render “slavery” fairly apprentice-like positions pay off debts
resembles indentured servitude during america’s founding people worked approximately 7 years pay off debt their passage new world
copan states god allow physical abuse servants
servant harmed example having tooth eye knocked out servant received freedom immediately
masters killed their servants put death
also argues new testament silent issue slavery
during first century 85 90 percent rome’s population consisted slaves both lowly prestigious positions
much higher percent israel old testament due rome’s policies laws
copan uses james 39 argue new testament presupposes fundamental equality because humans created god’s image
christian masters called christian slaves “brothers” “sisters
new testament commanded masters show compassion justice patience
their position master meant responsibility service oppression privilege
given spiritual equality slave free slaves even took leadership positions churches
states early christians undermined slavery indirectly rejecting many common greco-roman assumptions acknowledging intrinsic equal worth slaves
copan argues new testament authors too explicit overthrowing rome's slavery system done gospel disservice
rome quashed any such flagrant opposition speedy lethal force
copan concludes new testament took subversive strategy opposing oppression slave trade treating humans cargo — eventually led slavery-free europe few centuries later
imprecatory psalms copan defends old testament imprecatory psalms psalms call down curses divine judgments against israel's enemies
argues fit literary genre time
states consider how you react neighbor tried seduce your daughter give your children drugs
outrage indicates care take injustice seriously
copan also compares these psalms emotional rants jeremiah wishing remained mother’s womb until died
jeremiah's desire emotional outburst sincerely believe
copan argues imprecatory psalms should read same way
personal life copan married jacqueline mariette van tol copan daughter dutch parents six children
