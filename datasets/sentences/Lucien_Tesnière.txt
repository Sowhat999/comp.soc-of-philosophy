born mont-saint-aignan may 13 1893
professor strasbourg 1924 later montpellier 1937 published many papers books slavic languages
however importance history linguistics based mainly development approach syntax natural languages become known dependency grammar
presented theory book éléments de syntaxe structurale elements structural syntax published posthumously 1959
book proposes sophisticated formalization syntactic structures supported many examples diversity languages
tesnière died montpellier december 6 1954
many central concepts modern study syntax takes granted developed presented tesnière's book
instance tesnière developed concept valency detail primary distinction arguments actants adjuncts circumstants french circonstants most theories syntax now acknowledge build central tesnière's understanding
tesnière also argued vehemently syntax autonomous morphology semantics

connections tesnière begins presentation theory syntax connection
connections present words sentences
group words together creating units assigned meaning
tesnière writes every word sentence isolated dictionary
mind perceives connections word neighbors
totality these connections forms scaffold sentence
these connections indicated anything absolutely crucial perceived mind without them sentence intelligible
sentence type alfred spoke composed just two elements alfred spoke rather three elements first being alfred second spoke third connection unites them without there no sentence
say sentence type alfred spoke consists two elements analyze superficial manner purely morphologically while neglecting essential aspect syntactic link
connections tesnière describes passage now widely called dependencies hence term dependency grammar
two words connected dependency equal status rather word superior other subordinate
tesnière called superior word governor inferior word subordinate
acknowledging totality connections words sentence tesnière position assign sentence concrete syntactic structure terms stemma see below
autonomous syntax tesnière rejected influence morphology field syntax
doing promoting break tradition linguistics focused concrete forms such affixes inflectional paradigms associated study languages antiquity latin greek
tesnière argued study syntax should limited examination concrete forms rather acknowledge explore connections just described above
pointed key concept innere sprachform 'inner speech form' established wilhelm von humboldt
since innere sprachform
connections abstract cannot acknowledge explore central role plays syntax focusing just concrete forms
tesnière arguing other words syntax largely independent morphology autonomous component natural language
tesnière also saw syntax semantics separate domains language
illustrate separation produced nonsensical sentence le silence vertébral indispose voile licite 'the vertebral silence indisposes licit sail'
emphasized while sentence nonsensical well-formed syntactic point view forms words their order appearance correct
noam chomsky made same point famous sentence colorless green ideas sleep furiously
verb centrality tesnière argued vehemently against binary division clause subject predicate prevalent study syntax replaced division verb centrality
stated division stems logic no place linguistics
positioned verb root clause structure whereby other elements clause either directly indirectly dependent verb
tesnière illustrated distinction diagrammatic representations stemmas french sentence alfred parle lentement 'alfred speaks slowly' latin sentence filius amat patrem 'the father loves son' diagram french sentence above illustrates binary division tesnière rejected clause divided two parts subject alfred predicate parle lentement
latin sentence below illustrates verb centrality tesnière espoused verb amat root clause subject filius object patrem dependents
importance distinction resides overall understanding sentence structure arises these competing views
theory syntax starts binary division likely become phrase structure grammar constituency grammar whereas theory syntax starts verb centrality likely become dependency grammar
stemmas tesnière relied heavily tree-like diagrams represent understanding sentence structure syntax pursuing
called these diagrams stemmas - éléments contains over 350 them
these stemmas show connections manner connections link words sentences hierarchy structure e
these diagrams show main traits tesnière's conception syntactic structure
verb centrality evident since verb highest word stemma root
syntactic units present constituents phrases identified correspond complete subtrees
important aspect these stemmas unordered
reflect actual word order
tesnière structural order hierarchical order preceded linear order mind speaker
speaker first conceives he/she wants say whereby conception consists words organized hierarchically terms connections structural order
act speaking involves transforming structural order linear order conversely act hearing understanding involves transforming linear order structural order
strict separation ordering dimensions point contention among modern dependency grammars
dependency grammars
stratified ones e
meaning-text theory functional generative description build strict separation structural order linear order whereas other dependency grammars e
word grammar monostratal syntax hence reject separation
centrifugal head-initial centripetal head-final languages given hierarchical organization syntactic units posited represented using stemmas tesnière identified centripetal centrifugal structures
modern terms these concepts head-initial centrifugal head-final centripetal
centrifugal structures see governors heads preceding their dependents whereas situation reversed centrifugal structures dependents preceding their heads e
tesnière actually produce ordered stemmas like two right here
does choose reflect word order stemmas then distinction centrifugal vs
centripetal structures tesnière established clearly visible
following two trees english sentences stop attempting sister's attempts succeeded illustrate distinction stemmas clearly show manner centrifugal structures extend down right centripetal structures down left
tesnière classified languages according whether centrifugal centripetal vice versa
distinction since become mainstay language typology
languages classified terms their head-directionality parameter predominantly head-initial head-final
semitic languages e
hebrew arabic instance much centrifugal centripetal certain east asian languages much centripetal centrifugal e
japanese korean
english mitigated language according tesnière meaning contains good mixture both centrifugal centripetal structures
valency valency metaphor tesnière contributed our understanding nature lexicon
compared verbs molecules
like oxygen atom o attracts two hydrogen atoms h create h2 o molecule verbs attract actants create clauses
verbs therefore valency
tesnière distinguished verbs avalent no actant monovalent actant divalent two actants trivalent three actants
english examples follow avalent verb rained
- verb rain avalent pronoun semantically devoid content
monovalent verb sam slept
- verb sleep monovalent takes single actant divalent verb susan knows sam
- verb know divalent takes two actants subject actant object actant trivalent verb sam gave susan earrings
- verb give trivalent takes three actants subject actant two object actants
valency characteristics verbs play role exploration various mechanisms syntax
particular various phenomena diathesis active passive reflexive reciprocal recessive sensitive underlying valency verbs
concept valency now widely acknowledged study syntax even most phrase structures grammars acknowledging valency predicates
actants vs
circonstants addition actants tesnière acknowledged circumstants french circonstants
while actants appear verb important completing meaning verb circumstants add optional content e
tomorrow alfred leaving noon
- circumstants tomorrow noon add optional content
sees lot time everywhere
- circumstants lot time everywhere add optional content
number actants appear clause limited valency characteristics clause-establishing verb whereas number circumstants appear clause theoretically unlimited since circumstants restricted verb valency
modern syntax acknowledges actants circumstants course also although uses different terminology
actants known arguments circumstants adjuncts again tesnière identified explored key concepts now mainstay modern study syntax
transfer second half elements 300 pages focuses theory transfer french translation
transfer component tesnière's theory addresses syntactic categories
tesnière interested keeping number principle syntactic categories minimum
acknowledged just four basic categories content words nouns o verbs adjectives adverbs e
abbreviations used these words o e match last letter corresponding esperanto designations
addition these four basic content words also posited two types function words indices translatives
took articles definite indefinite clitic pronouns indices typical translatives subordinators subordinate conjunctions prepositions
main task translatives perform transfer content words category another
instance prepositions typically transfer nouns adjectives adverbs subordinators typically transfer verbs nouns
example phrase le livre de pierre 'the book peter peter's book' preposition de serves transfer noun pierre adjective modify noun livre
other words noun pierre although technically adjective comes function like adjective addition translative de
transfer represented stemmas using special convention
following stemmas represent phrase de pierre 'of peter' sentence écrivez dans le livre de votre ami 'write book your friend' translative word transfers placed equi-level vertical dividing line separates them
target category
category result transfer indicated above horizontal line
first stemma above indicates pierre transferred de adjective
stemma below shows two instances transfer whereby first indicates dans livre de votre ami transferred adverb second de votre ami transferred adjective
tesnière ability transfer category another will fluid speech primary tool makes truly productive speech possible
syntactic categories alone capable combining each other immediately unified translative effects transfer
legacy tesnière's legacy resides primarily widespread view sees éléments starting point impetus development dependency grammar
thus frameworks syntax grammar dependency-based e
word grammar meaning-text theory functional generative description generally cite tesnière father modern dependency grammars
interesting side note regard tesnière himself set out produce dependency grammar since distinction dependency- constituency-based grammars phrase structure grammars known linguistics while tesnière alive
distinction first became established during reception tesnière's ideas
tesnière's legacy limited development dependency grammar however
stated above number key concepts developed e
valency arguments vs
adjuncts head-initial vs head-final languages cornerstones most modern work field syntax
interestingly though tesnière does receive full credit perhaps deserves contribution field syntax
tesnière died shortly before initiation generative grammar éléments remained untranslated english until just recently 2015
thus influence greater europe english-speaking north america
