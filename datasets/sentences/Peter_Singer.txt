animal liberation main article animal liberation book published 1975 animal liberation cited formative influence leaders modern animal liberation movement
central argument book expansion utilitarian idea greatest good greatest number measure good ethical behaviour
singer believes there no reason apply principle other animals arguing boundary human animal completely arbitrary

popularized term speciesism coined previously english writer richard
ryder describe practice privileging humans over other animals
animal liberation singer argues favour vegetarianism against animal experimentation

principle equal consideration interests does dictate equal treatment those interests since different interests warrant different treatment
interest avoiding pain instance relatively few interest cultivating their abilities
does principle justify different treatment different interests allows different treatment same interest diminishing marginal utility factor
example approach privilege starving person's interest food over same interest someone slightly hungry
among important human interests those avoiding pain developing one's abilities satisfying basic needs food shelter enjoying warm personal relationships being free pursue one's projects without interference many others
fundamental interest entitles being equal consideration capacity suffering and/or enjoyment happiness
singer holds being's interests should weighed according being's concrete properties
favors 'journey' model life measures wrongness taking life degree doing frustrates life journey's goals
[clarification needed] journey model tolerant frustrated desire explains why persons embarked their journeys replaceable
personal interest continuing live brings journey model play
model also explains priority singer attaches interests over trivial desires pleasures
ethical conduct justifiable reasons go beyond prudence something bigger individual addressing larger audience
singer thinks going-beyond identifies moral reasons somehow universal specifically injunction 'love thy neighbor thyself' interpreted demanding give same weight interests others gives one's own interests
universalising step singer traces kant hare crucial sets apart those moral theorists hobbes david gauthier tie morality prudence
universalisation leads directly utilitarianism singer argues strength thought one's own interests cannot count interests others
taking these account must weigh them up adopt course action most likely maximise interests those affected utilitarianism arrived
singer's universalising step applies interests without reference them whereas kantian's applies judgments rational agents kant's kingdom ends rawls's original position etc
singer regards kantian universalisation unjust animals
hobbesians singer attempts response final chapter practical ethics arguing self-interested reasons support adoption moral point view such 'the paradox hedonism' counsels happiness best found looking need most people feel relate something larger their own concerns
abortion euthanasia infanticide singer holds right life essentially tied being's capacity hold preferences turn essentially tied being's capacity feel pain pleasure
practical ethics singer argues favour abortion grounds fetuses neither rational nor self-aware therefore hold no preferences
result argues preference mother abortion automatically takes precedence
sum singer argues fetus lacks personhood
similar argument abortion singer argues newborns lack essential characteristics personhood—rationality autonomy self-consciousness—and therefore killing newborn baby never equivalent killing person being wants go living
singer classifies euthanasia voluntary involuntary non-voluntary
voluntary euthanasia subject consents
argues favour voluntary euthanasia forms non-voluntary euthanasia including infanticide certain instances opposes involuntary euthanasia

board member animal charity evaluators charity evaluator used many members effective altruism community recommends most cost-effective animal advocacy charities interventions
own organisation life you save also recommends selection charities deemed charity evaluators such give well most effective comes helping those extreme poverty
organisation founded after singer released 2009 book life you save argues generally favour giving charities help end global poverty
particular expands upon arguments made 1972 essay famine affluence morality posits citizens rich nations morally obligated give least their disposable income charities help global poor
supports using drowning child analogy states most people rescue drowning child pond even meant their expensive clothes ruined clearly value human life value our material possessions
result should take significant portion money spend our possessions instead donate charity
other views meta-ethical views past singer held objective moral values exist basis reason favour both egoism equal consideration interests
singer himself adopted utilitarianism basis people's preferences universalised leading situation takes point view universe impartial standpoint
however second edition practical ethics concedes question why should act morally cannot given answer will provide everyone overwhelming reasons acting morally
however co-authoring point view universe 2014 singer shifted position objective moral values exist defended 19 th century utilitarian philosopher henry sidgwick's view objective morality derived fundamental moral axioms
furthermore singer de lazari-radek co-author book argue evolutionary debunking arguments used demonstrate rational take impartial standpoint point view universe opposed egoism - pursuing one's own self-interest - because existence egoism likely product evolution natural selection rather because correct whereas taking impartial standpoint equally considering interests sentient beings conflict expect natural selection meaning likely impartiality ethics correct stance pursue
doping elite sports singer agrees julian savulescu elite athletes should allowed take whatever performance-enhancing drugs wish long safe them
argument without drugs those best genes unfair advantage
setting maximum level red blood cells [for endurance events] actually levels playing field reducing impact genetic lottery
effort then becomes important having right genes

williams claimed singer's utilitarianism impractical it's impossible make these calculations comparisons real life
williams develops extended critique singer suggesting speciesism prejudice roughly equivalent sexism racism suggesting yet face sort scenarios species membership become morally significant property science fiction-style thought experiments may provide such examples
imagines invasion aliens very disgusting indeed their faces instance those faces seething seem worms wait long enough find out may gather quite benevolent
aliens want live us—rather closely us even though their disgustingness really truly unforgettable
williams also suggests another sort alien visitors might much successful experience running peacable societies need exercise significant control remove cultural autonomy human beings
