kaczynski worked odd jobs received financial support family used purchase land without their knowledge later use fund bombing campaign
1978 worked briefly father brother foam rubber factory fired brother david harassing female supervisor previously dated refused boyfriend sharing much common
kaczynski's original goal move out secluded place become self-sufficient live autonomously
began teach himself survival skills such tracking edible plant identification how construct primitive technologies such bow drills
quickly realized possible live way result watching wild land around get destroyed development industry
performed isolated acts sabotage initially targeted developments near cabin
ultimate catalyst drove begin campaign bombings went out walk favorite wild spots find destroyed replaced road
best place me largest remnant plateau dates tertiary age
it's kind rolling country flat you get edge you find these ravines cut very steeply cliff-like drop-offs there even waterfall there
two days' hike my cabin
best spot until summer 1983
summer there too many people around my cabin decided needed peace
went back plateau got there found put road right through middle
you just can't imagine how upset
point decided rather trying acquire further wilderness skills work getting back system
began dedicating himself reading sociology books political philosophy such works jacques ellul also stepped up campaign sabotage
soon came conclusion violent methods solution saw problem industrial civilization
says lost faith idea reform saw violent collapse way bring down techno-industrial system
regarding switch being reformer system developing means taking down don't think done
part because human tendency most people there exceptions take path least resistance
they'll take easy way out giving up your car your television set your electricity path least resistance most people
see don't think there any controlled planned way dismantle industrial system
think way will get rid breaks down collapses
big problem people don't believe revolution possible possible precisely because believe possible
large extent think eco-anarchist movement accomplishing great deal think better
real revolutionaries should separate themselves reformers
think good conscious effort being made get many people possible introduced wilderness
general way think done try convince persuade majority people right much try increase tensions society point things start break down
create situation people get uncomfortable enough they're going rebel
question how you increase those tensions? bombings fbi reproduction bomb created kaczynski display newseum washington

throughout manuscript produced typewriter without capacity italics kaczynski capitalizes entire words order show emphasis
refers himself either fc freedom club though there no evidence worked others
donald foster analyzed writing request kaczynski's defense notes manuscript contains instances irregular spelling hyphenation well other consistent linguistic idiosyncrasies led conclude indeed kaczynski
industrial society future begins kaczynski's assertion industrial revolution consequences disaster human race
first sections text devoted discussion psychology leftists negative consequences individuals small groups within industrial-technological system
kaczynski writes industrial system robbed contemporary humans their autonomy diminished their rapport nature forced them behave ways increasingly remote natural pattern human behavior
later sections speculate future evolution system arguing will inevitably lead end human freedom call revolution against technology attempt indicate how might accomplished
political social views opening closing sections kaczynski addresses leftism movement analyzes psychology leftists arguing true believers eric hoffer's sense participate powerful social movements compensate their insecurity feelings inferiority someone interprets derogatory almost anything groups whom identifies conclude inferiority feelings low self-esteem
tendency pronounced among minority rights advocates whether belong minority groups whose rights defend
hypersensitive words used designate minorities
those most sensitive politically incorrect terminology average black ghetto-dweller asian immigrant abused woman disabled person minority activists many whom even belong any oppressed group come privileged strata society
political correctness stronghold among university professors secure employment comfortable salaries majority whom heterosexual white males middle-class families
goes explain how nature leftism determined psychological consequences oversocialization
kaczynski attribute[s] social psychological problems modern society fact society requires people live under conditions radically different those under human race evolved behave ways conflict patterns behavior human race developed while living under earlier conditions
further specifies primary cause long list social psychological problems modern society disruption power process defines having four elements moral code our society demanding no think feel act completely moral way
people highly socialized attempt think feel act morally imposes severe burden them
order avoid feelings guilt continually deceive themselves their own motives find moral explanations feelings actions reality non-moral origin
use term oversocialized describe such people
three most clear-cut these call goal effort attainment goal
everyone needs goals whose attainment requires effort needs succeed attaining least goals
fourth element difficult define may necessary everyone
call autonomy will discuss later
divide human drives three groups those drives satisfied minimal effort 2 those satisfied cost serious effort 3 those cannot adequately satisfied no matter how much effort makes
power process process satisfying drives second group
kaczynski goes claim [i]n modern industrial society natural human drives tend pushed first third groups second group tends consist increasingly artificially created drives
among these drives surrogate activities activities directed toward artificial goal people set up themselves merely order goal work toward let us say merely sake 'fulfillment' get pursuing goal
argues these surrogate activities satisfactory attainment real goals many most people
claims scientific research surrogate activity scientists reason science marches blindly without regard real welfare human race any other standard obedient psychological needs scientists government officials corporation executives provide funds research
kaczynski developed philosophical ideas early life up moment bombings carried extensive ongoing debate brother david
ted identified strongly positivism meaning strongly believed objective reality through sensory experience analysis obtain authentic knowledge
kaczynski throughout most earlier years 1960 s deconstructivism distrust system desire revolution remained intellectual outsider considered himself important others
perceived control methods mentioned above result disruption power process primary cause various maladies society e
crime depression etc
kaczynski maintains rather recognizing humans currently live conditions make them terribly unhappy system
industrial society develops ways controlling human responses overly stressful environment find themselves
following current examples according kaczynski trend imagine society subjects people conditions make them terribly unhappy then gives them drugs take away their unhappiness
science fiction? already happening extent our own society
well known rate clinical depression greatly increasing recent decades
believe due disruption power process
entertainment industry serves important psychological tool system possibly even dishing out large amounts sex violence
entertainment provides modern man essential means escape
while absorbed television videos etc
forget stress anxiety frustration dissatisfaction
sylvan learning centers example great success motivating children study psychological techniques also used less success many conventional schools
parenting techniques taught parents designed make children accept fundamental values system behave ways system finds desirable
historical views predictions last sections manifesto kaczynski carefully defines means freedom provides argument hopelessly difficult
reform industrial system such way prevent progressively narrowing our sphere freedom
says spite technical advances relating human behavior system date impressively successful controlling human beings predicts [i]f system succeeds acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough will probably survive
otherwise will break down issue will most likely resolved within next several decades say 40 100 years
gives various dystopian possibilities type society evolve former case
claims revolution unlike reform possible calls sympathetic readers initiate such revolution using two strategies heighten social stresses within system increase likelihood will break down develop propagate ideology opposes technology
gives various tactical recommendations including avoiding assumption political power avoiding any collaboration leftists supporting free trade agreements order bind world economy fragile unified whole
