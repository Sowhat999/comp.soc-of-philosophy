passionate love liberty law respect rights
am neither revolutionary party nor conservative
liberty my foremost passion

none them strong enough fight alone advantage guarantee liberty everyone combine forces
such combination evidence
above often misquoted slavery quote due previous translations french text
most recent translation arthur goldhammer 2004 translates meaning stated above
examples misquoted sources numerous internet text does contain words americans enamored equality anywhere
tocqueville explicitly cites inequality being incentive poor become rich notes often two generations within family maintain success inheritance laws split eventually break apart someone's estate cause constant cycle churn poor rich thereby over generations making poor rich rich poor
cites protective laws france time protected estate being split apart among heirs thereby preserving wealth preventing churn wealth such perceived 1835 within united states america
civil political society individual tocqueville's main purpose analyze functioning political society various forms political associations although brought reflections civil society too relations political civil society
tocqueville hegel marx civil society sphere private entrepreneurship civilian affairs regulated civil code
critic individualism tocqueville thought through associating coming together people mutual purpose both public private americans able overcome selfish desires thus making both self-conscious active political society vibrant civil society functioning according political civil laws state
according political scientist joshua kaplan tocqueville originate concept individualism instead changed meaning saw calm considered feeling deposes each citizen isolate himself mass fellows withdraw circle family friends
little society formed taste gladly leaves greater society look itself
while tocqueville saw egotism selfishness vices saw individualism failure feeling way thinking things either positive consequences such willingness work together negative consequences such isolation individualism remedied improved understanding
individualism positive force prompted people work together common purposes seen self-interest properly understood then helped counterbalance danger tyranny majority since people take control over their own lives without government aid
according kaplan americans difficult time accepting tocqueville's criticism stifling intellectual effect omnipotence majority americans tend deny there problem regard
democracy new forms tyranny tocqueville warned modern democracy may adept inventing new forms tyranny because radical equality lead materialism expanding bourgeoisie selfishness individualism
such conditions lose interest future our descendents
meekly allow ourselves led ignorance despotic force powerful because does resemble
tocqueville worried despotism take root modern democracy much dangerous version oppression under roman emperors tyrants past exert pernicious influence small group people time
contrast despotism under democracy see multitude men uniformly alike equal constantly circling petty pleasures unaware fellow citizens subject will powerful state exerted immense protective power
tocqueville compared potentially despotic democratic government protective parent wants keep citizens children perpetual children doesn't break men's wills rather guides presides over people same way shepherd looking after flock timid animals
american social contract tocqueville's penetrating analysis sought understand peculiar nature american political life
describing america agreed thinkers such aristotle montesquieu balance property determined balance political power conclusions after differed radically those predecessors
tocqueville tried understand why america different europe last throes aristocracy
america contrast aristocratic ethic society hard work money-making dominant ethic common man enjoyed level dignity unprecedented commoners never deferred elites described crass individualism market capitalism taken root extraordinary degree
tocqueville writes among democratic people there no hereditary wealth every man works earn living
labor held honor prejudice against favor
alexis de tocqueville tocqueville asserted values triumphed north present south begun suffocate old-world ethics social arrangements
legislatures abolished primogeniture entails resulting widely distributed land holdings
contrast general aristocratic pattern eldest child usually man inherited estate effect keeping large estates intact generation generation
america contrast landed elites less likely pass fortunes single child action primogeniture meant time went large estates became broken up within few generations turn made children equal overall
negative development according joshua kaplan's interpretation tocqueville since bonds affection shared experience children often replaced formal relation eldest child siblings characteristic previous aristocratic pattern
overall new democracies hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult secure people forced struggle their own living
rapidly democratizing society tocqueville understood population devoted middling values wanted amass through hard work vast fortunes
tocqueville's mind explained why america different europe
europe claimed nobody cared making money
lower classes no hope gaining minimal wealth while upper classes found crass vulgar unbecoming their sort care something unseemly money many virtually guaranteed wealth took granted
same time america workers see people fashioned exquisite attire merely proclaim through hard work too soon possess fortune necessary enjoy such luxuries
despite maintaining aristotle montesquieu others balance property determined balance power tocqueville argued america showed equitable property holdings ensure rule best men
fact quite opposite
widespread relatively equitable property ownership distinguished america determined mores values also explained why american masses held elites such contempt
majority rule mediocrity beyond eradication old-world aristocracy ordinary americans also refused defer those possessing tocqueville put superior talent intelligence these natural elites enjoy much share political power result
ordinary americans enjoyed too much power claimed too great voice public sphere defer intellectual superiors
culture promoted relatively pronounced equality tocqueville argued same mores opinions ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity
those possessed true virtue talent left limited choices
tocqueville those most education intelligence left two choices
join limited intellectual circles explore weighty complex problems facing society use their superior talents amass vast fortunes private sector
tocqueville know any country there less independence mind true freedom discussion america
blamed omnipotence majority rule chief factor stifling thinking majority enclosed thought within formidable fence
writer free inside area woe man goes beyond stands fear inquisition must face kinds unpleasantness every day persecution
career politics closed offended power holds keys
tocqueville contrast previous political thinkers argued serious problem political life people too strong people too weak felt powerless danger people felt swept up something control according kaplan's interpretation tocqueville
us slavery blacks indians uniquely positioned crossroads american history tocqueville's democracy america attempted capture essence american culture values
though supporter colonialism tocqueville clearly perceive evils blacks indians subjected america
tocqueville devoted last chapter first volume democracy america question while travel companion gustave de beaumont wholly focused slavery fallouts american nation marie slavery america
tocqueville notes among races exist america first attracts eye first enlightenment power happiness white man european man par excellence below appear negro indian
these two unfortunate races neither birth nor face nor language nor mores common their misfortunes look alike
both occupy equally inferior position country inhabit both experience effects tyranny their miseries different accuse same author them
tocqueville contrasted settlers virginia middle-class religious puritans founded new england analyzed debasing influence slavery men sent virginia seekers gold adventurers without resources without character whose turbulent restless spirit endangered infant colony
artisans agriculturalists arrived afterwards
hardly any respect above level inferior classes england
no lofty views no spiritual conception presided over foundation these new settlements
colony scarcely established slavery introduced capital fact exercise immense influence character laws whole future south
dishonors labor introduces idleness society idleness ignorance pride luxury distress
enervates powers mind benumbs activity man
same english foundation there developed north very different characteristics
tocqueville concluded removal negro population america resolve problem writes end first democracy colony liberia able receive thousands new inhabitants every year negroes state sent thither advantage union supply society annual subsidies transport negroes africa government vessels still unable counterpoise natural increase population among blacks remove many men year born upon territory within time prevent growth evil daily increasing states
negro race will never leave those shores american continent brought passions vices europeans will disappear new world long continues exist
inhabitants united states may retard calamities apprehend cannot now destroy their efficient cause
1855 following text published maria weston chapman liberty bell testimony against slavery think me foreigner indicate united states time measures men whom slavery shall abolished
still persevering enemy despotism everywhere under forms am pained astonished fact freest people world present time almost among civilized christian nations yet maintains personal servitude while serfdom itself disappearing already disappeared most degraded nations europe
old sincere friend america am uneasy seeing slavery retard her progress tarnish her glory furnish arms her detractors compromise future career union guaranty her safety greatness point out beforehand her her enemies spot strike
man too am moved spectacle man's degradation man hope see day law will grant equal civil liberty inhabitants same empire god accords freedom will without distinction dwellers upon earth
policies assimilation according tocqueville assimilation black people almost impossible already being demonstrated northern states
tocqueville predicted formal freedom equality segregation become population's reality after civil war during reconstruction bumpy road true integration black people
assimilation however best solution native americans since too proud assimilate inevitably become extinct
displacement another part america's indian policy
both populations undemocratic without qualities intellectual otherwise needed live democracy
tocqueville shared many views assimilation segregation coming epochs opposed arthur de gobineau's theories found inequality human races 1853–55
us russia future global powers democracy america tocqueville also forecast preeminence united states russia two main global powers
book stated there now two great nations world starting different points seem advancing toward same goal russians anglo-americans
each seems called secret design providence day hold hands destinies half world
1841 discourse conquest algeria french historian colonialism olivier le cour grandmaison underlined how tocqueville well michelet used term extermination describe happening during colonization western united states indian removal period
tocqueville thus expressed himself 1841 concerning conquest algeria far am concerned came back africa pathetic notion present our way waging war far barbaric arabs themselves
these days represent civilization
way waging war seems me stupid cruel
found head coarse brutal soldier
indeed pointless replace turks reproduce world rightly found hateful them
even sake interest noxious useful another officer telling me our sole aim equal turks fact shall far lower position theirs barbarians barbarians turks will outdo us because muslim barbarians
france often heard men respect approve deplore crops should burnt granaries emptied finally unarmed men women children should seized
my view these unfortunate circumstances any people wishing wage war against arabs must accept
think means available wreck tribes must used barring those human kind right nations condemn
personally believe laws war enable us ravage country must either destroying crops harvest time any time making fast forays also known raids aim get hold men flocks
whatever case may say general manner political freedoms must suspended algeria
tocqueville thought conquest algeria important two reasons first understanding international situation france's position world second changes french society
tocqueville believed war colonization restore national pride threatened believed gradual softening social mores middle classes
their taste material pleasures spreading whole society giving example weakness egotism
applauding methods general bugeaud tocqueville went far claim war africa science
everyone familiar rules everyone apply those rules almost complete certainty success
greatest services field marshal bugeaud rendered country spread perfected made everyone aware new science
tocqueville advocated racial segregation algeria two distinct legislations european colonists arab population
such two-tier arrangement fully realised 1870 crémieux decree indigenousness code extended french citizenship european settlers algerian jews whereas muslim algerians governed muslim law restricted second-class citizenship
tocqueville's opposition invasion kabylie opposition olivier le cour grandmaison jean-louis benoît claimed given extent racial prejudices during colonization algeria tocqueville most moderate supporters
benoît claimed wrong assume tocqueville supporter bugeaud despite 1841 apologetic discourse
seems tocqueville modified views after second visit algeria 1846 criticized bugeaud's desire invade kabylie 1847 speech assembly
although tocqueville favoured retention distinct traditional law administrators schools etc
arabs come under french control judged berber tribes kabylie second two letters algeria 1837 savages suited arrangement best managed argued force arms pacifying influences commerce cultural interaction
tocqueville's views matter complex
even though 1841 report algeria applauded bugeaud making war way defeated abd-el-kader's resistance advocated two letters french military advance leave kabylie undisturbed subsequent speeches writings continued oppose intrusion kabylie
debate 1846 extraordinary funds tocqueville denounced bugeaud's conduct military operations succeeded convincing assembly vote funds support bugeaud's military columns
tocqueville considered bugeaud's plan invade kabylie despite opposition assembly seditious act face government opting cowardice
report algeria 1847 1847 report algeria tocqueville declared europe should avoid making same mistake made european colonization americas order avoid bloody consequences
particularly reminds countrymen solemn caution whereby warns them methods used towards algerian people remain unchanged colonization will end blood bath
tocqueville includes report algeria fate their soldiers finances depended how french government treats various native populations algeria including various arab tribes independent kabyles living atlas mountains powerful political leader abd-el-kader
various letters essays algeria tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies european country approach imperialism
particular author differentiates terms 'dominance' particular version 'colonization'
latter stresses obtainment protection land passageways promise commercial wealth
case algeria port algiers control over strait gibraltar considered tocqueville particularly valuable
direct control political operations entirety algeria however
thus author stresses domination over certain points political influence means colonization commercially valuable areas
tocqueville argued domination via violent means though unpleasant necessary colonization justified laws war
such laws discussed detail however given goal french mission algeria obtain commercial military interest opposed self-defense deduced tocqueville concur just war theory's jus ad bellum criteria just cause
further given tocqueville approved use force eliminate civilian housing enemy territory approach does accord just war theory's jus bello criteria proportionality discrimination
