craig established online apologetic ministry reasonable faith
thought kalam cosmological argument craig best known use version cosmological argument coined kalam cosmological argument recognition medieval islamic history
kalām cosmological argument formulates argument following manner everything begins exist cause existence
universe began exist
therefore universe cause existence
philosophically craig uses two traditional arguments show time finite argues existence actual infinite metaphysically impossible forming actual infinite through successive addition metaphysically impossible
granting strict logical consistency post-cantorian axiomatized infinite set theory craig says existence actually infinite number things metaphysically impossible due counter-intuitive absurdities arise
craig uses example hilbert's hotel fully occupied yet through transposition lodgers accommodate infinite number guests
craig argues envisioning different groups guests checking out hotel subtract identical quantities identical quantities non-identical quantities remainders absurd
stating mathematical conventions stipulated ensure logical consistency transfinite arithmetic no ontological force craig believes finitism most plausibly true series past events must finite argues indicates universe began exist
craig says just impossible despite proponents super-tasks count infinity metaphysically impossible count down infinity
craig says inversion story tristram shandy counter-intuitive absurdity result formation actual infinite
craig claims universe eternal infinite number events occurred before present moment says impossible
craig's contributions kalam cosmological argument reference astrophysics support universe's beginning namely expansion universe thermodynamics
craig says friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker metric big bang model predicts cosmic singularity marks origin universe finite past
craig says competing models imply origin universe either proved untenable such steady state model vacuum fluctuation models implied beginning universe designed avoid oscillating models inflationary models quantum gravity models
craig says borde-guth-vilenkin theorem 2003 requires any universe average state cosmic expansion cannot eternal
craig believes recent discoveries expansion universe relativity theory support view thermodynamic properties universe show eternal
craig says postulating multiverse worlds varying thermodynamic states encounter problem boltzmann brains—that becomes highly probable any observer universe illusion own brain solipsistic conclusion craig says no rational person embrace
based these arguments craig concludes premise universe began exist plausible conjoined premise beginning universe implies existence cause
craig claims due nature cause must uncaused beginningless changeless timeless spaceless immaterial being enormous power refers god
divine omniscience central questions raised classical doctrine divine omniscience compatibility divine foreknowledge free will god foreknows occurrence event e does e happen necessarily? 2 event e contingent how god foreknow e's occurrence? according craig first question raises issue theological fatalism
craig attempts reduce problem problem logical fatalism holds true e will happen then e will happen necessarily
challenges theological fatalists show how addition god's knowing future-tense statement true adds anything essential problem over above statement's being true
craig says theological fatalists misunderstood temporal necessity necessity past impossibility backward causation does imply cannot sort counterfactual power over past events
craig surveyed rejection parallel fatalistic arguments fields other theology philosophy religion
reviews discussions backward causation time travel special theory relativity precognition newcomb's paradox conclude fatalistic reasoning failed
second question arising divine foreknowledge future contingents concerns means god knows such events
craig says question presupposes tensed a-theory time tenseless b-theory time there no ontological distinction past present future contingent events future relative us no difficult god know contingent events relative us past present
distinguishing perceptualist conceptualist models divine cognition craig says models construe god's foreknowledge future along perceptualist lines god foresees will happen difficult reconcile tensed theory time though might say god perceives present truth-values future contingent propositions
does similarly challenge conceptualist model construes god's knowledge along lines innate ideas
doctrine middle knowledge such conceptualist model divine cognition craig explored
formulated jesuit theologian luis de molina doctrine middle knowledge holds logically prior decree create world god knew every possible creature might create freely any possible set circumstances god might place
basis knowledge such counterfactuals free will knowledge own decree create certain creatures certain circumstances along own decision how himself shall act god automatically knows everything will actually contingently happen without any perception world
craig become proponent molinism supporting middle knowledge also applying wide range theological issues such divine providence predestination biblical inspiration perseverance saints christian particularism problem evil
divine eternity craig's earlier work kalam cosmological argument divine omniscience intersected significantly philosophy time nature divine eternity
craig examines arguments aimed showing either god timeless omnitemporal
defends coherence timeless personal being says arguments divine timelessness unsound inconclusive
contrast gives two arguments favor divine temporality
first says temporal world exists then virtue real relations world god cannot remain untouched temporality
craig says given god's changing relations world must change least extrinsically sufficient existing temporally
second craig says temporal world exists then virtue omniscience god must know tensed facts world such happening now craig argues sufficient being temporally located
craig argues since temporal world does exist follows god exists time
craig says there way escape these arguments accept b-theory time
craig concludes one's theory time watershed issue one's doctrine divine eternity
tensed theory time 2000 tenseless theory time 2000 craig examines arguments against a- b-theories time respectively
elements craig's philosophy time differentiates time itself our measures classical newtonian theme includes analysis spatial tenses location i-now defense presentism analysis mc taggart's paradox instance problem temporary intrinsics defense neo-lorentzian interpretation special relativity formulation tensed possible worlds semantics
craig presents doctrine divine eternity god's relationship time
defending leibniz's argument against god's enduring infinite time prior creating universe appealing kalam cosmological argument craig says god exists timelessly temporally since moment creation
craig says cosmic time registers age universe measure god's time
universe craig concludes god's clock
resurrection jesus craig's two volumes historical argument resurrection jesus 1985 assessing new testament evidence historicity resurrection jesus 3 ed
2002 christian reviewers gary habermas christopher price among most thorough investigations event jesus' resurrection
former volume craig describes history discussion including david hume's arguments against identification miracles
latter volume exegetical study new testament material pertinent resurrection
craig summarizes relevant evidence under three major heads tomb jesus found empty group female followers sunday after crucifixion
2 various individuals groups experienced appearances jesus alive after death
3 earliest disciples came believe god raised jesus dead despite strong predispositions contrary
craig's discussion evidence each these events includes defense traditions jesus' burial joseph arimathea close exegesis pauline doctrine resurrection body investigation pagan jewish notions resurrection dead
craig says best explanation these three events god raised jesus dead
craig's explanation conflicts others particular lüdemann's hallucination hypothesis
craig says resurrection hypothesis best meets standard criteria weighing historical hypotheses such explanatory power explanatory scope plausibility forth
craig claims provided there god there higher probability resurrection hypothesis negation argues resurrection hypothesis cannot improbable
says probability miraculous explanation evidence increased locates resurrection jesus context jesus' ministry personal statements
craig says context also provides interpretive key meaning jesus' resurrection craig says divine vindication allegedly blasphemous statements jesus tried executed
divine aseity craig currently focused challenge posed platonism divine aseity self-existence
craig rejects view god creates abstract objects defends nominalistic perspectives abstract objects
stating quine-putnam indispensability argument chief support platonism craig criticizes willard van orman quine's naturalized epistemology confirmational holism also rejects metaontological criterion ontological commitment
craig favors neutral logic according formal quantifiers first-order logic well informal quantifiers ordinary language ontologically committing
also advocates deflationary theory reference according referring speech act rather word-world relation singular terms may used true sentences without commitment corresponding objects world
stipulates first-order quantifiers being used devices ontological commitment then craig adverts fictionalism particular pretense theory according statements abstract objects expressions make-believe imagined true though literally false
other views craig critic metaphysical naturalism new atheism prosperity theology well defender reformed epistemology
also states being confessing christian compatible practicing homosexuality
craig maintains theory evolution compatible christianity
although does fully endorse intelligent design critical young earth creationism thinks intelligent design may viable alternative evolution
fellow discovery institute's center science culture fellow international society complexity information design iscid
