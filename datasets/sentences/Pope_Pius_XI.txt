quadragesimo anno 1931 written mark 'forty years' since pope leo xiii's 1878–1903 encyclical rerum novarum restated encyclical's warnings against both socialism unrestrained capitalism enemies human freedom dignity
pius xi instead envisioned economy based co-operation solidarity
quadragesimo anno stated social economic issues vital church technical point view terms moral ethical issues involved
ethical considerations include nature private property terms functions society development individual
defined fair wages branded exploitation both materially spiritually international capitalism
private property church role discussing issues related social order
social economic issues vital her technical point view terms moral ethical issues involved
ethical considerations include nature private property
within catholic church several conflicting views developed
pope pius xi declares private property essential development freedom individual
those deny private property deny personal freedom development
pius private property social function well
private property loses morality subordinated common good
therefore governments right redistribution policies
extreme cases pope grants state right expropriation private property
capital labour related issue pius relation capital labour determination fair wages
pius develops following ethical mandate church considers perversion industrial society developed sharp opposite camps based income
welcomes attempts alleviate these differences
three elements determine fair wage worker's family economic condition enterprise economy whole
family innate right development possible within framework functioning economy sound enterprise
thus pius concludes cooperation conflict necessary condition given mutual interdependence parties involved
social order pius xi believed industrialization results less freedom individual communal level because numerous free social entities get absorbed larger ones
society individuals becomes mass class-society
people much interdependent ancient times become egoistic class-conscious order save freedom themselves
pope demands solidarity especially employers employees through new forms cooperation communication
pius displays negative view capitalism especially anonymous international finance markets
identifies certain dangers small medium-size enterprises insufficient access capital markets squeezed destroyed larger ones
warns capitalist interests become danger nations reduced “chained slaves individual interests” pius xi first pope utilise power modern communications technology evangelising wider world
established vatican radio 1931 first pope broadcast radio

friction continued over catholic action youth network mussolini wanted merge fascist youth group
third document agreement paid vatican 1750 million lira $100 million seizures church property since 1860
pius xi invested money stock markets real estate
manage these investments pope appointed lay-person bernardino nogara through shrewd investing stocks gold futures markets significantly increased catholic church's financial holdings
income largely paid upkeep expensive-to-maintain stock historic buildings vatican until 1870 maintained through funds raised papal states
