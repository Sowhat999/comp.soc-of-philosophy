1671 she married dirck kerckring
during period spinoza also became acquainted collegiants anti-clerical sect remonstrants tendencies towards rationalism mennonites existed century close remonstrants
many friends belonged dissident christian groups met regularly discussion groups typically rejected authority established churches well traditional dogmas
spinoza's break prevailing dogmas judaism particularly insistence non-mosaic authorship pentateuch sudden rather appears result lengthy internal struggle anyone thinks my criticism [regarding authorship bible] too sweeping nature lacking sufficient foundation ask undertake show us these narratives definite plan such might legitimately imitated historians their chronicles
succeeds shall once admit defeat will my mighty apollo
confess my efforts over long period resulted no such discovery
indeed may add write nothing here fruit lengthy reflection although educated boyhood accepted beliefs concerning scripture felt bound end embrace views here express
nevertheless once branded heretic spinoza's clashes authorities became pronounced
example questioned two members synagogue spinoza apparently responded god body nothing scripture says otherwise
later attacked steps synagogue knife-wielding assailant shouting heretic! apparently quite shaken attack years kept wore torn cloak unmended souvenir
after father's death 1654 spinoza younger brother gabriel abraham
ran family importing business
business ran serious financial difficulties however perhaps result first anglo-dutch war
march 1656 spinoza filed suit amsterdam municipal authorities declared orphan order escape father's business debts inherit mother's estate first incorporated father's estate without being subject father's creditors
addition after having made substantial contributions talmud torah synagogue 1654 1655 reduced december 1655 contribution march 1656 pledge nominal amounts march 1656 pledge never paid
spinoza eventually able relinquish responsibility business debts younger brother gabriel devote himself chiefly study philosophy especially system expounded descartes optics
expulsion jewish community 27 july 1656 talmud torah congregation amsterdam issued writ cherem hebrew חרם kind ban shunning ostracism expulsion excommunication against 23-year-old spinoza
following document translates official record censure lords ma'amad having long known evil opinions acts baruch de espinoza endeavoured various means promises turn evil ways
having failed make mend wicked ways contrary daily receiving serious information abominable heresies practised taught monstrous deeds having numerous trustworthy witnesses deposed born witness effect presence espinoza became convinced truth matter after investigated presence honourable chachamin [sages] decided their consent espinoza should excommunicated expelled people israel
decree angels command holy men excommunicate expel curse damn baruch de espinoza consent god blessed consent holy congregation front these holy scrolls six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts written therein excommunication joshua banned jericho curse elisha cursed boys curses written book law
cursed day cursed night cursed lies down cursed rises up cursed goes out cursed comes

you cleave unto lord god alive day
order no should communicate orally writing show any favour stay under same roof within four ells read anything composed written
talmud torah congregation issued censure routinely matters great small such edict unusual
statue spinoza near house paviljoensgracht hague
language spinoza's censure unusually harsh however does appear any other censure known issued portuguese jewish community amsterdam
exact reason expelling spinoza stated
censure refers abominable heresies practised taught monstrous deeds testimony witnesses presence espinoza
there no record such testimony there appear several likely reasons issuance censure
first there spinoza's radical theological views apparently expressing public
philosopher spinoza biographer steven nadler puts no doubt giving utterance just those ideas soon appear philosophical treatises
those works spinoza denies immortality soul strongly rejects notion providential god—the god abraham isaac jacob claims law neither literally given god nor any longer binding jews
there any mystery why history's boldest most radical thinkers sanctioned orthodox jewish community? second amsterdam jewish community largely composed former conversos fled portuguese inquisition within previous century their children grandchildren
community must concerned protect reputation any association spinoza lest controversial views provide basis their own possible persecution expulsion
there little evidence amsterdam municipal authorities directly involved spinoza's censure itself
1619 town council expressly ordered [the portuguese jewish community] regulate their conduct ensure members community kept strict observance jewish law
other evidence makes clear danger upsetting civil authorities never far mind such bans adopted synagogue public wedding funeral processions discussing religious matters christians lest such activity might disturb liberty enjoy
thus issuance spinoza's censure almost certainly part exercise self-censorship portuguese jewish community amsterdam
third appears likely spinoza already taken initiative separate himself talmud torah congregation vocally expressing hostility judaism itself
probably stopped attending services synagogue either after lawsuit sister after knife attack steps
might already voicing view expressed later theological-political treatise civil authorities should suppress judaism harmful jews themselves
either financial other reasons any case effectively stopped contributing synagogue march 1656
also committed monstrous deed contrary regulations synagogue views rabbinical authorities including maimonides filing suit civil court rather synagogue authorities—to renounce father's heritage no less
upon being notified issuance censure reported very well does force me anything done my own accord afraid scandal
thus unlike most censure issued routinely amsterdam congregation discipline members censure issued against spinoza lead repentance never withdrawn
after censure spinoza addressed apology defence written spanish elders synagogue defended views orthodox condemned rabbis accusing 'horrible practices other enormities' merely because neglected ceremonial observances
apology does survive contents may later included theological-political treatise
example cited series cryptic statements medieval biblical commentator abraham ibn ezra intimating apparently anachronistic passages pentateuch
[t]he canaanite then land genesis 126 ibn ezra called mystery exhorted those understand[] keep silent mosaic authorship proof own views valid historical precedent
most remarkable aspect censure may much issuance even spinoza's refusal submit fact spinoza's expulsion jewish community lead conversion christianity
spinoza kept latin implicitly christian name benedict de spinoza maintained close association collegiants christian sect even moved town near collegiants' headquarters buried christian graveyard—but there no evidence suggestion ever accepted baptism participated christian mass
thus default baruch de espinoza became first secular jew modern europe
september portugees-israëlietische gemeente te amsterdam asked chief rabbi their community haham pinchas toledano reconsider cherem after consulting several spinoza experts
however declined remove citing spinoza's preposterous ideas tearing apart very fundamentals our religion

philosophy opening page spinoza's magnum opus ethics substance attributes modes main article philosophy baruch spinoza these fundamental concepts spinoza sets forth vision being illuminated awareness god
may seem strange first sight
question is? replies substance attributes modes
— karl jaspers spinoza argued god exists abstract impersonal
spinoza's view god charles hartshorne describes classical pantheism
spinoza also described epicurean materialist specifically reference opposition cartesian mind-body dualism
view held epicureans before believed atoms their probabilistic paths substance existed fundamentally
spinoza however deviated significantly epicureans adhering strict determinism much like stoics before contrast epicurean belief probabilistic path atoms line contemporary thought quantum mechanics
spinoza's system imparted order unity tradition radical thought offering powerful weapons prevailing against received authority
contended everything exists nature
everything universe reality substance there set rules governing whole reality surrounds us part
spinoza viewed god nature two names same reality namely single fundamental substance meaning stands beneath rather matter basis universe lesser entities actually modes modifications things determined nature exist cause effects complex chain cause effect understood part
identification god nature fully explained posthumously published ethics
spinoza's main contention cartesian mind–body dualism mind body truly distinct then clear how coordinate any manner
humans presume themselves free will argues result their awareness appetites affect their minds while being unable understand reasons why want act
spinoza contends deus sive natura being infinitely many attributes thought extension two
account nature reality then seems treat physical mental worlds intertwined causally related deriving same substance
important note here parts 3 through 4 ethics spinoza describes how human mind affected both mental physical factors
directly contests dualism
universal substance emanates both body mind while different attributes there no fundamental difference these aspects
formulation historically significant solution mind–body problem known neutral monism
spinoza's system also envisages god does rule over universe providence god make changes god itself deterministic system everything nature part
spinoza argues things produced god any other way any other order case directly challenges transcendental god actively responds events universe
everything will happen part long chain cause effect metaphysical level humans unable change
no amount prayer ritual will sway god
knowledge god existence humans inhabit allows them best respond world around them
impossible two infinite substances exist two infinities being absurd god—being ultimate substance—cannot affected anything else else affected something else fundamental substance
spinoza thoroughgoing determinist held absolutely everything happens occurs through operation necessity
even human behaviour fully determined freedom being our capacity know determined understand why act
forming adequate ideas our emotions affections become adequate cause our effects internal external entails increase activity versus passivity
means become both free like god spinoza argues scholium prop
49 part ii
however spinoza also held everything must necessarily happen way does
therefore humans no free will
believe however their will free
illusionary perception freedom stems our human consciousness experience indifference prior natural causes
humans think free ″dream their eyes open″
spinoza our actions guided entirely natural impulses
letter g
schuller letter 58 men conscious their desire unaware causes [their desires] determined
picture spinoza's determinism ever illuminated through reading famous quote ethics ″the infant believes free will seeks breast angry boy believes free will wishes vengeance timid man thinks free will seeks flight drunkard believes free command mind speaks things sober wishes left unsaid
… believe speak free command mind whilst truth no power restrain impulse speak
″ thus spinoza morality ethical judgement like choice predicated illusion
spinoza ″blame″ ″praise″ non existent human ideals fathomable mind because acclimatized human consciousness interlinking our experience false ideal choice predicated upon
spinoza's philosophy much common stoicism inasmuch both philosophies sought fulfil therapeutic role instructing people how attain happiness
however spinoza differed sharply stoics important respect utterly rejected their contention reason defeat emotion
contrary contended emotion displaced overcome stronger emotion
crucial distinction active passive emotions former being those rationally understood latter those
also held knowledge true causes passive emotion transform active emotion thus anticipating key ideas sigmund freud's psychoanalysis
ethical philosophy spinoza shared ethical beliefs ancient epicureans renouncing ethics beyond material world although epicureans focused physical pleasure spinoza emotional wellbeing
encapsulated start treatise improvement understanding tractatus de intellectus emendatione core spinoza's ethical philosophy held true final good
spinoza held good evil relative concepts claiming nothing intrinsically good bad except relative particularity
things classically seen good evil spinoza argued simply good bad humans
spinoza believes deterministic universe things nature proceed certain [definite] necessity utmost perfection
nothing happens chance spinoza's world nothing contingent
spinoza's ethics main article ethics spinoza universe anything happens comes essential nature objects god/nature
according spinoza reality perfection
circumstances seen unfortunate because our inadequate conception reality
while components chain cause effect beyond understanding human reason human grasp infinitely complex whole limited because limits science empirically take account whole sequence
spinoza also asserted sense perception though practical useful inadequate discovering truth
concept conatus states human beings' natural inclination strive toward preserving essential being asserts virtue/human power defined success preservation being guidance reason one's central ethical doctrine
according spinoza highest virtue intellectual love knowledge god/nature/universe
also ethics spinoza discusses beliefs considers three kinds knowledge come perceptions
first kind knowledge writes knowledge experiences
precisely first type knowledge known knowledge things “mutilated confused without order
spinoza benedict 1677
books 1–5
another explanation first knowledge knowledge dangerous reasoning
dangerous reason lacks any type rationality causes mind “passive” state
type “passive mind” spinoza writes earlier books ethics state mind adequate causes become passions
spinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions
explains knowledge rationality any adequate causes anything common human mind
example anything classified being imperfect virtue
imperfect virtues seen those incomplete
many philosophers such thomas aquinas aristotle compare imperfect virtue pagan virtue
spinoza defines third final knowledge knowledge god requires rationality reason mind
detail spinoza uses type knowledge join together essence god individual essence
knowledge also formed any adequate causes include perfect virtue
spinoza benedict 1677
books 1–5
final part ethics concern meaning true blessedness explanation how emotions must detached external cause master them foreshadow psychological techniques developed 1900 s
concept three types knowledge—opinion reason intuition—and assertion intuitive knowledge provides greatest satisfaction mind lead proposition conscious ourselves nature/universe perfect blessed reality intuitive knowledge eternal
given spinoza's insistence completely ordered world necessity reigns good evil no absolute meaning
world exists looks imperfect because our limited perception
history reception pantheist panentheist atheist? main article spinozism see also pantheism controversy unfavorable engraving depiction philosopher spinoza captioned latin jew atheist
widespread belief spinoza equated god material universe
therefore called prophet prince most eminent expounder pantheism
specifically letter henry oldenburg states view certain people identify god nature taken kind mass corporeal matter quite mistaken
spinoza our universe cosmos mode under two attributes thought extension
god infinitely many other attributes present our world
according german philosopher karl jaspers spinoza deus sive natura god nature spinoza meant god natura naturans natura naturata jaspers believed spinoza philosophical system mean say god nature interchangeable terms rather god's transcendence attested infinitely many attributes two attributes known humans namely thought extension signified god's immanence
even god under attributes thought extension cannot identified strictly our world
world course divisible parts
spinoza insists no attribute substance truly conceived follows substance divided means cannot conceive attribute way leads division substance substance absolutely infinite indivisible ethics part propositions 12 13
following logic our world should considered mode under two attributes thought extension
therefore according jaspers pantheist formula apply spinoza preserves transcendence interpreted totality finite things
martial guéroult suggested term panentheism rather pantheism describe spinoza's view relation god world
world god strong sense god
finite things god their cause cannot conceived without god
however american panentheist philosopher charles hartshorne insisted term classical pantheism describe spinoza's view
1785 friedrich heinrich jacobi published condemnation spinoza's pantheism after lessing thought confessed deathbed being spinozist equivalent time being called atheist
jacobi claimed spinoza's doctrine pure materialism because nature god nothing extended substance
jacobi result enlightenment rationalism finally end absolute atheism
moses mendelssohn disagreed jacobi saying there no actual difference theism pantheism
issue became major intellectual religious concern european civilization time
attraction spinoza's philosophy late 18 th-century europeans provided alternative materialism atheism deism
three spinoza's ideas strongly appealed them unity exists regularity happens identity spirit nature
1879 spinoza’s pantheism praised many considered alarming dangerously inimical
spinoza's god nature deus sive natura provided living natural god contrast newtonian mechanical first cause dead mechanism french man machine
coleridge shelley saw spinoza's philosophy religion nature
novalis called god-intoxicated man
spinoza inspired poet shelley write essay necessity atheism
spinoza considered atheist because used word god deus signify concept different traditional judeo–christian monotheism
spinoza expressly denies personality consciousness god neither intelligence feeling nor will does act according purpose everything follows necessarily nature according law
thus spinoza's cool indifferent god antithesis concept anthropomorphic fatherly god cares humanity
according stanford encyclopedia philosophy spinoza's god “infinite intellect” ethics 2 p11 c knowing 2 p3 capable loving both himself—and us insofar part perfection
5 p35 c mark personal being towards entertain personal attitudes then should note too spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei intellectual love god supreme good man
5 p33 however matter complex
spinoza's god does free will p32 c1 does purposes intentions apendix spinoza insists “neither intellect nor will pertain nature god” p17 s1
moreover while may love god need remember god really kind being ever love us back
“he loves god cannot strive god should love return” says spinoza 5 p19
steven nadler suggests settling question spinoza's atheism pantheism depends analysis attitudes
pantheism associated religiosity then spinoza pantheist since spinoza believes proper stance take towards god reverence religious awe instead objective study reason since taking religious stance leave open possibility error superstition
