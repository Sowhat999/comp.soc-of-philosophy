here bakhtin greatly influenced classicist f
zelinsky whose works contain beginnings concepts elaborated bakhtin
career bakhtin completed studies 1918
bakhtin then moved small city western russia nevel pskov oblast worked schoolteacher two years
time first bakhtin circle formed
group consisted intellectuals varying interests shared love discussion literary religious political topics
included group valentin voloshinov eventually p
medvedev joined group later vitebsk
vitebsk “a cultural centre region” perfect place bakhtin “and other intellectuals [to organize] lectures debates concerts
german philosophy topic talked most frequently point forward bakhtin considered himself philosopher literary scholar
nevel also bakhtin worked tirelessly large work concerning moral philosophy never published entirety
however 1919 short section work published given title art responsibility
piece constitutes bakhtin’s first published work
bakhtin relocated vitebsk 1920
here 1921 bakhtin married elena aleksandrovna okolovich
later 1923 bakhtin diagnosed osteomyelitis bone disease ultimately led amputation leg 1938
illness hampered productivity rendered invalid
1924 bakhtin moved leningrad assumed position historical institute provided consulting services state publishing house
time bakhtin decided share work public just before question methodology aesthetics written works published journal appear stopped publication
work eventually published 51 years later
repression misplacement manuscripts something plague bakhtin throughout career
1929 problems dostoevsky’s art bakhtin’s first major work published
here bakhtin introduces concept dialogism
however just book introduced bakhtin accused participating russian orthodox church's underground movement
truthfulness charge known even today
consequently during many purges artists intellectuals joseph stalin conducted during early years rule bakhtin sentenced exile siberia appealed grounds weakened state kill
instead sentenced six years internal exile kazakhstan
bakhtin spent these six years working book-keeper town kustanai during time several important essays including discourse novel
1936 taught courses mordovian pedagogical institute saransk
obscure figure provincial college dropped out view taught occasionally
1937 bakhtin moved kimry town located hundred kilometers moscow
here bakhtin completed work book concerning 18 th-century german novel subsequently accepted sovetskii pisatel' publishing house
however copy manuscript disappeared during upheaval caused german invasion
commemorative plaque marking building mikhail bakhtin worked
after amputation leg 1938 bakhtin’s health improved became prolific
1940 until end world war ii bakhtin lived moscow submitted dissertation françois rabelais gorky institute world literature obtain postgraduate title dissertation defended until war ended
1946 1949 defense dissertation divided scholars moscow two groups those official opponents guiding defense accepted original unorthodox manuscript those other professors against manuscript’s acceptance
book's earthy anarchic topic cause many arguments ceased government intervened
ultimately bakhtin denied doctorate doctor sciences granted lesser degree candidate sciences state accrediting bureau
later bakhtin invited back saransk took position chair general literature department mordovian pedagogical institute
1957 institute changed teachers' college university bakhtin became head department russian world literature
1961 bakhtin’s deteriorating health forced retire 1969 search medical attention bakhtin moved back moscow lived until death 1975
bakhtin’s works ideas gained popularity after death endured difficult conditions much professional life time information often seen dangerous therefore often hidden
result details provided now often uncertain accuracy
also contributing imprecision these details limited access russian archival information during bakhtin’s life
after archives became public scholars realized much thought knew details bakhtin’s life false skewed largely bakhtin himself
works ideas toward philosophy act toward philosophy act first published ussr 1986 title k filosofii postupka
manuscript written 1919–1921 found bad condition pages missing sections text illegible
consequently philosophical essay appears today fragment unfinished work
toward philosophy act comprises introduction first few pages missing part full text
however bakhtin’s intentions work altogether lost provided outline introduction stated essay contain four parts
first part essay deals analysis performed acts deeds comprise actual world world actually experienced merely thinkable world
three subsequent unfinished parts toward philosophy act bakhtin states topics intends discuss
outlines second part will deal aesthetic activity ethics artistic creation third ethics politics fourth religion
toward philosophy act reveals young bakhtin process developing moral philosophy decentralizing work kant
text bakhtin’s early works concerning ethics aesthetics here bakhtin lays out three claims regarding acknowledgment uniqueness one’s participation being both actively passively participate being
my uniqueness given simultaneously exists degree actualize uniqueness other words performed act deed yet achieved
because am actual irreplaceable must actualize my uniqueness
bakhtin further states relation whole actual unity my unique thought arises my unique place being
bakhtin deals concept morality whereby attributes predominating legalistic notion morality human moral action
according bakhtin cannot maintain neutrality toward moral ethical demands manifest themselves one’s voice consciousness
here also bakhtin introduces architectonic schematic model human psyche consists three components i-for-myself i-for-the-other other-for-me
i-for-myself unreliable source identity bakhtin argues i-for-the-other through human beings develop sense identity because serves amalgamation way others view me
conversely other-for-me describes way others incorporate my perceptions them their own identities
identity bakhtin describes here does belong merely individual rather shared
problems dostoyevsky's poetics polyphony unfinalizability during time leningrad bakhtin shifted view away philosophy characteristic early works towards notion dialogue
time began engagement work fyodor dostoevsky
problems dostoyevsky’s art considered bakhtin’s seminal work here bakhtin introduces three important concepts
first concept unfinalizable self individual people cannot finalized completely understood known labeled
though possible understand people treat them completely known bakhtin’s conception unfinalizability respects possibility person change person never fully revealed fully known world
readers may find conception reflects idea soul bakhtin strong roots christianity neo-kantian school led hermann cohen both emphasized importance individual's potentially infinite capability worth hidden soul
second idea relationship self others other groups
according bakhtin every person influenced others inescapably intertwined way consequently no voice isolated
interview novy mir editorial staff 'response question novy mir editorial staff' bakhtin once explained order understand immensely important person understands located outside object her creative understanding—in time space culture
cannot even really see one's own exterior comprehend whole no mirrors photographs help our real exterior seen understood other people because located outside us space because others
~new york review books june 10 1993
such bakhtin's philosophy greatly respected influences others self merely terms how person comes also how person thinks how person sees him- herself truthfully
third bakhtin found dostoevsky's work true representation polyphony many voices
each character dostoevsky's work represents voice speaks individual self distinct others
idea polyphony related concepts unfinalizability self-and-others since unfinalizability individuals creates true polyphony
bakhtin briefly outlined polyphonic concept truth
criticized assumption two people disagree least them must error
challenged philosophers whom plurality minds accidental superfluous
bakhtin truth statement sentence phrase
instead understanding number mutually addressed albeit contradictory logically inconsistent statements
understanding needs multitude carrying voices
cannot held within single mind also cannot expressed single mouth
polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices
bakhtin does mean say many voices carry partial truths complement each other
number different voices make truth simply averaged synthesized
fact mutual addressivity engagement commitment context real-life event distinguishes underatanding misunderstanding
subsequent years problems dostoyevsky’s art translated english published west bakhtin added chapter concept carnival book published slightly different title problems dostoyevsky’s poetics
according bakhtin carnival context distinct individual voices heard flourish interact together
carnival creates threshold situations regular conventions broken reversed genuine dialogue becomes possible
notion carnival bakhtin's way describing dostoevsky's polyphonic style each individual character strongly defined same time reader witnesses critical influence each character upon other
say voices others heard each individual each inescapably shapes character other
rabelais world carnival grotesque main article rabelais world during world war ii bakhtin submitted dissertation french renaissance writer françois rabelais defended until years later
controversial ideas discussed within work caused much disagreement consequently decided bakhtin denied doctorate
thus due content rabelais folk culture middle ages renaissance published until 1965 time given title rabelais world russian творчество франсуа рабле и народная культура средневековья и ренессанса tvorčestvo fransua rable narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja renessansa
classic renaissance studies rabelais world bakhtin concerns himself openness gargantua pantagruel however book itself also serves example such openness
throughout text bakhtin attempts two things seeks recover sections gargantua pantagruel past either ignored suppressed conducts analysis renaissance social system order discover balance language permitted language
means analysis bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts first carnival carnivalesque bakhtin describes social institution second grotesque realism defined literary mode
thus rabelais world bakhtin studies interaction social literary well meaning body material bodily lower stratum
chapter history laughter bakhtin advances notion therapeutic liberating force arguing laughing truth

dialogic imagination chronotope heteroglossia dialogic imagination first published whole 1975 compilation four essays concerning language novel epic novel 1941 prehistory novelistic discourse 1940 forms time chronotope novel 1937–1938 discourse novel 1934–1935
through essays contained within dialogic imagination bakhtin introduces concepts heteroglossia dialogism chronotope making significant contribution realm literary scholarship
bakhtin explains generation meaning through primacy context over text heteroglossia hybrid nature language polyglossia relation utterances intertextuality
heteroglossia base condition governing operation meaning any utterance
make utterance means appropriate words others populate them one's own intention
bakhtin's deep insights dialogicality represent substantive shift views nature language knowledge major thinkers such ferdinand de saussure immanuel kant
epic novel bakhtin demonstrates novel’s distinct nature contrasting epic
doing bakhtin shows novel well-suited post-industrial civilization live because flourishes diversity
same diversity epic attempts eliminate world
according bakhtin novel genre unique able embrace ingest devour other genres while still maintaining status novel
other genres however cannot emulate novel without damaging their own distinct identity
prehistory novelistic discourse less traditional essay bakhtin reveals how various different texts past ultimately come together form modern novel
forms time chronotope novel introduces bakhtin’s concept chronotope
essay applies concept order further demonstrate distinctive quality novel
word chronotope literally means time space defined bakhtin intrinsic connectedness temporal spatial relationships artistically expressed literature
purpose writing author must create entire worlds doing forced make use organizing categories real world lives
reason chronotope concept engages reality
final essay discourse novel bakhtin’s most complete statements concerning philosophy language
here bakhtin provides model history discourse introduces concept heteroglossia
term heteroglossia refers qualities language extralinguistic common languages
these include qualities such perspective evaluation ideological positioning
way most languages incapable neutrality every word inextricably bound context exists
speech genres other late essays speech genres other late essays bakhtin moves away novel concerns himself problems method nature culture
there six essays comprise compilation response question novy mir editorial staff bildungsroman significance history realism problem speech genres problem text linguistics philology human sciences experiment philosophical analysis notes made 1970-71 toward methodology human sciences
response question novy mir editorial staff transcript comments made bakhtin reporter monthly journal called novy mir widely read soviet intellectuals
transcript expresses bakhtin’s opinion literary scholarship whereby highlights shortcomings makes suggestions improvement
bildungsroman significance history realism fragment bakhtin’s lost books
publishing house bakhtin submitted full manuscript blown up during german invasion bakhtin possession prospectus
however due shortage paper bakhtin began using remaining section roll cigarettes
portion opening section remains
remaining section deals primarily goethe
problem speech genres deals difference saussurean linguistics language living dialogue translinguistics
relatively short space essay takes up topic bakhtin planned write book making essay rather dense complex read
here bakhtin distinguishes literary everyday language
according bakhtin genres exist merely language rather communication
dealing genres bakhtin indicates studied within realm rhetoric literature each discipline draws largely genres exist outside both rhetoric literature
these extraliterary genres remained largely unexplored
bakhtin makes distinction primary genres secondary genres whereby primary genres legislate those words phrases expressions acceptable everyday life secondary genres characterized various types text such legal scientific etc
problem text linguistics philology human sciences experiment philosophical analysis compilation thoughts bakhtin recorded notebooks
these notes focus mostly problems text various other sections paper discuss topics taken up elsewhere such speech genres status author distinct nature human sciences
however problem text deals primarily dialogue way text relates context
speakers bakhtin claims shape utterance according three variables object discourse immediate addressee superaddressee
bakhtin describes tertiary nature dialogue
notes made 1970-71 appears also collection fragments extracted notebooks bakhtin kept during years 1970 1971
here bakhtin discusses interpretation endless possibilities
according bakhtin humans habit making narrow interpretations such limited interpretations serve weaken richness past
final essay toward methodology human sciences originates notes bakhtin during mid-seventies last piece writing bakhtin produced before died
essay makes distinction dialectic dialogics comments difference text aesthetic object
here also bakhtin differentiates himself formalists felt underestimated importance content while oversimplifying change structuralists too rigidly adhered concept code
disputed texts works bear names bakhtin's close friends v
vološinov p
medvedev attributed bakhtin particularly marxism philosophy language formal method literary scholarship
these claims originated early 1970 s received their earliest full articulation english clark holquist's 1984 biography bakhtin
years since then however most scholars come agree vološinov medvedev ought considered true authors these works
although bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars may even hand composing works attributed them now seems clear necessary attribute authorship these works person vološinov medvedev respectively should receive credit
bakhtin difficult life career few works published authoritative form during lifetime
result there substantial disagreement over matters normally taken granted discipline worked philosopher literary critic? how periodize work even texts see below
known series concepts used adapted number disciplines dialogism carnivalesque chronotope heteroglossia outsidedness english translation russian term vnenakhodimost sometimes rendered english—from french rather russian—as exotopy
together these concepts outline distinctive philosophy language culture center claims discourse essence dialogical exchange endows language particular ethical ethico-political force
legacy literary theorist bakhtin associated russian formalists work compared yuri lotman 1963 roman jakobson mentioned few intelligent critics formalism
during 1920 s bakhtin's work tended focus ethics aesthetics general
early pieces such towards philosophy act author hero aesthetic activity indebted philosophical trends time—particularly marburg school neo-kantianism hermann cohen including ernst cassirer max scheler lesser extent nicolai hartmann
bakhtin began discovered scholars 1963 after death 1975 authors such julia kristeva tzvetan todorov brought bakhtin attention francophone world there popularity united states united kingdom many other countries continued grow
late 1980 s bakhtin's work experienced surge popularity west
bakhtin’s primary works include toward philosophy act unfinished portion philosophical essay problems dostoyevsky’s art bakhtin later added chapter concept carnival published title problems dostoyevsky’s poetics rabelais world explores openness rabelaisian novel dialogic imagination whereby four essays comprise work introduce concepts dialogism heteroglossia chronotope speech genres other late essays collection essays bakhtin concerns himself method culture
1920 s there bakhtin school russia line discourse analysis ferdinand de saussure roman jakobson
influence known today interest wide variety subjects ideas vocabularies periods well use authorial disguises influence alongside györgy lukács growth western scholarship novel premiere literary genre
result breadth topics dealt bakhtin influenced such western schools theory neo-marxism structuralism social constructionism semiotics
bakhtin's works also useful anthropology especially theories ritual
however influence such groups somewhat paradoxically resulted narrowing scope bakhtin’s work
according clark holquist rarely those incorporate bakhtin’s ideas theories their own appreciate work entirety
while bakhtin traditionally seen literary critic there no denying impact realm rhetorical theory
among many theories ideas bakhtin indicates style developmental process occurring both within user language language itself
work instills reader awareness tone expression arises careful formation verbal phrasing
means writing bakhtin enriched experience verbal written expression ultimately aids formal teaching writing
even suggest bakhtin introduces new meaning rhetoric because tendency reject separation language ideology
leslie baxter explains bakhtin “because language use riddled multiple voices understood generally discourses ideologies perspectives themes meaning-making general understood interplay those voices
bakhtin communication studies bakhtin's communication legacy reaches beyond rhetoric social constructionism semiotics called philosopher human communication
bakhtin “concentrates heavily language general use
leslie baxter observes “communication scholars much gain conversing bakhtin’s dialogism
kim argues “theories human communication through verbal dialogue literary representations” such ones bakhtin studied “will apply virtually every academic discipline human sciences
bakhtin's theories dialogism influence interpersonal communication research dialogism represents methodological turn towards messy reality communication many language forms
order understand bakhtin communication scholar must take forms communication account
while bakhtin’s works focused primarily text interpersonal communication also key especially two related terms culture
kim states “culture geertz bakhtin allude generally transmitted through communication reciprocal interaction such dialogue
interpersonal communication “any concrete utterance link chain speech communication particular sphere
very boundaries utterance determined change speech subjects
utterances indifferent another self-sufficient aware mutually reflect another
every utterance must regarded primarily response preceding utterances given sphere understand word ‘response’ here broadest sense
each utterance refutes affirms supplements relies upon others presupposes them known somehow takes them account
therefore each kind utterance filled various kinds responsive reactions other utterances given sphere speech communication
reminiscent inter-personal theory communication turn-taking
means every utterance related another utterance true turn-taking conversational norms followed order conversation cohesive flow individuals respond another
example utterance does pertain previous utterance then conversation occurring
however utterance will likely pertain utterance individual once heard- meaning fact interrelated just context particular conversation
kim explains “the entire world viewed polyglossic multi-voiced since every individual possesses their own unique world view must taken consideration through dialogical interaction
world view must considered conversation occurring order better understand cultural communicative significance
communication culture “bakhtin’s life work understood critique monologization human experience perceived dominant linguistic literary philosophical political theories time
true roots social constructionism post-modernism bakhtin “was critical efforts reduce unfinalizable open multivocal process meaning-making determinate closed totalizing ways
according bakhtin meaning found any dialogue unique sender recipient based upon their personal understanding world influenced socio-cultural background
“bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space communication scholars conceive difference new ways” meaning must take background subject consideration conducting research their understanding any text “a dialogic perspective argues difference kinds basic human experience
kim argues “his ideas art vehicle oriented towards interaction audience order express communicate any sort intention reminiscent clifford geertz’s theories culture
culture communication become inextricably linked another one’s understanding according bakhtin given utterance text message contingent upon their culture background experience
carnivalesque communication sheckel's contends [
bakhtin] terms ‘carnivalesque’ tied body public exhibition private functions [
served also communication event [
anti-authority communication events [
also deemed ‘carnivalesque’
essentially act turning society around through communication whether form text protest otherwise serves communicative form carnival according bakhtin
steele furthers idea carnivalesque communication she argues found corporate communication
steele states “that ritualized sales meetings annual employee picnics retirement roasts similar corporate events fit category carnival
carnival cannot help linked communication culture steele points out “in addition qualities inversion ambivalence excess carnival’s themes typically include fascination body particularly little-glorified 'lower strata' parts dichotomies ‘high’ ‘low’
high low binary particularly relevant communication certain verbiage considered high while slang considered low
moreover much popular communication including television shows books movies fall high low brow categories
particularly prevalent bakhtin’s native russia postmodernist writers such boris akunin worked change low brow communication forms such mystery novel higher literary works art making constant references bakhtin’s favorite subjects dostoyevsky
