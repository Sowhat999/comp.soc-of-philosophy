published books history human world history human world brings radhakrishnan closer ever conventional unified book being divided three long chapters multipurpose introduction yet remains essentially collection essays
well critical engagement many most powerful influences thought book marks somewhat departure radhakrishnan move away poststructuralist methodology towards perhaps back phenomenology albeit updated modified form
sense being extended meditation between-ness senses refracted through lens phenomenology critically juxtaposing works thinkers such friedrich nietzsche adrienne rich frantz fanon edward michel foucault maurice merleau-ponty martin heidegger david harvey ranajit guha spite elaborate structure arguments familiar density history human world fairly cohesive unifying theme critical agenda radhakrishnan's earlier books represent exciting new phase original contribution postcolonial theory critical theory generally
introduction introduction history human world most importantly serves set up subsequent three long chapters make up bulk book explain radhakrishnan's choice reemphasising central importance phenomenology work worldview
explains attention now focused tension series potentially contradictory possibly mutually invalidating imperatives need address general readership such broad issues history world predicament human subject caught past present knowing being phenomenology discursive systems nature anthropocentrism potential universality world structured dominance
subject turns attention phenomenology opposed poststructuralism informs essays book
radhakrishnan argues phenomenology offers way out irreconcilable theory versus history debates
proponents history claim high theory discounts incapable dealing real history whereas theorists claim through their scrupulous critical attention epistemological subject already taken care history
radhakrishnan argues edward said's career read index crisis particularly problematic embrace humanism face overwhelming poststructuralist critique inadequacies
also cites ranajit guha's embrace tagore's poetry alternative location historically real opposed discipline historiography another instance crisis theory history
alternative radhakrishnan proposes phenomenology general opens up exciting possibilities considering same phenomenon simultaneously variety discrete interrelated registers political aesthetic ethical individual collective
phenomenology brings us back space these binaries categories space 'i am' 'i think' poles human subjectivity argues place human subject dwells different poles binaries categories spaces identities imperatives experiences other forms subjectivity
radhakrishnan drawn phenomenology because invariably forces issues since becomes incumbent phenomenologically inflected human subject cogito raise issue accountability itself existence nature along multiple axes
purely poststructuralist methodology ultimately insufficient because systems matter thought matters because life matters living matters other way around
payoff possible politically committed ideologically partisan phenomenologist make meaningful differentiations example temporality historicity pre-discursive possibility discursive official actuality
because opens up in-between space reconfigured phenomenology crucial role play ongoing conversations history theory objectivism subjectivism
project trying reconfigure revivify phenomenology context describes history-theory stalemate key topography spaces defines three essays make up bulk book
radhakrishnan turn away poststructuralism least extent towards reconstructed form phenomenology suggests re-opening foreclosed spaces define essence both individual collective human subjectivity
identity location politics theory how handle unevenness west rest? how inevitable binary logic winners losers? how theory help us resolve our ethical political problems? theory help us think beyond “winner talks all” model articulating strong connections ethics politics? major intervention debates postcolonial global proposes theory should embody unevenness
radhakrishnan’s thought-provoking engagement theorists writers around world will fascinate readers across wide range disciplines

diasporic mediations diasporic mediations home location university minnesota press 1996
first collection essays diasporic mediations home location like radhakrishnan's books collection loosely connected essays built around set themes
title suggests diasporic mediations most closely associated relationship geographical cultural location individual collective subjectivity
doubling throughout essays alternates home diaspora individual group self other intellectuals masses divided subjectivities both individuals collectivities
radhakrishnan consistently juxtaposes concepts such here there us them self other
most essays book deal aspects how reconcile philosophical intellectual problems posed contemporary critical theory especially postcolonial theory imperative remaining engaged public intellectual how negotiate competing subjective positions both self within affiliational constituencies communities
major essays towards effective intellectual towards effective intellectual radhakrishnan challenges idea critical theory lost any ability connect practical politics because impossibility representation inadmissibility stable identity categories produce coherent constituencies
begins suggesting rainbow coalition two jesse jackson presidential campaigns 1980 s demonstrated practical application implications critical theory relationship individual group affiliations identity difference
radhakrishnan illustrates argument mainly comparing praxis proposed michel foucault versus antonio gramsci
credits foucault championing subjugated knowledges critiquing role intellectuals reinforcing social stratification class other forms oppression
however agrees edward foucault does go far enough because does interrogate own position broader question speaking opposed being
foucault concludes cannot macropolitics because attacking own location elite eurocentric intellectual cannot anything other cannot working class subjugated oppressed colonised
radhakrishnan contrasts foucault's assertion intellectual other forms leadership definition invalid no history organic noncoercive movement leaders whose authentic mutual connection constituencies makes act representation genuine historically real
denying possibility representation foucault actually forecloses prospect masses speaking themselves actual emergence subjugated knowledges
radhakrishnan argues while foucault's destabilization uni-vocal subject remains philosophical never becomes political gramsci continuously interrogating relationship individual group
gramsci thereby accords subjugated groups individuals historical political agency although affiliations shifting unstable
these shifting organic political affiliations gramsci permit emergence properly engaged intellectual actually represent real constituency
indeed gramsci intellectual engagement essential mass politics any form rather antithetical foucault suggest
radhakrishnan somewhat uncomfortably ultimately sides gramsci problem faced entire range emerging groups indeed organization
therefore leadership intellectuals indeed required
nonetheless recognises problem hegemony such roles entail
radhakrishnan argues constituencies avoid crises hegemony recognising says rainbow coalition difference identity identity difference
because any constituency made up heterogeneous elements
seek common cause hegemony political displacement potential consequences inbuilt contradiction
radhakrishnan therefore argues praxis should undertaken name weakest most oppressed element within formation
closes suggesting most productive question how read each history category terms other? constantly undermine dominant formations
suggests “mixing-in” foucault’s “post-political critique representation gramsci’s insistence need intellectual praxis political leadership
