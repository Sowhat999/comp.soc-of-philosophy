thought hume's empiricism biological evolution including herbert spencer chief features english thought during third quarter 19 th century
green represents primarily reaction against such doctrines
green argued these doctrines carried their logical conclusion rendered philosophy futile fatal practical life
reducing human mind series unrelated atomic sensations these related teachings destroyed possibility knowledge argued
these teachings especially important green refute because underpinned conception mind held nascent science psychology
green tried deflate pretensions psychologists claimed their young field provide scientific replacement traditional epistemology metaphysics
green further objected such empiricists represented person being simply result natural forces thereby made conduct any theory conduct meaningless life any human intelligible sense implies personal self knows 2 power
green thus driven theoretically practical necessity raise again whole question humankind relation nature
held discovered person themselves their relation their environment shall then know their function—what fitted
light knowledge shall able formulate moral code turn will serve criterion actual civic social institutions
these form naturally necessarily objective expression moral ideas civic social whole moral ideal must finally take concrete shape
man? ask man? ask experience? experience means am conscious
facts consciousness facts begin justified asserting exist
other hand valid evidence whatever necessary their own explanation
whatever logically involved them
now most striking characteristic humans fact marks them specially contrasted other animals self-consciousness
simplest mental act analyse operations human mind—the act sense-perception—is never merely change physical psychical consciousness change
human experience consists processes animal organism these processes recognised such
perceive outset apprehended fact—that say cannot analysed isolated elements so-called sensations such constituents consciousness exist first synthesis relations consciousness keeps distinct self various elements object though holding together unity act perception
other words whole mental structure call knowledge consists simplest equally most complex constituents work mind
locke hume held work mind eo ipso [by very act] unreal because made humans given humans
thus represented subjective creation objective fact
consequence follows upon assumption work mind arbitrary assumption shown unjustified results exact science distinction universally recognised such science draws truth falsehood real mere ideas
obviously valid distinction logically involves consequence object content knowledge viz
reality intelligible ideal reality system thought relations spiritual cosmos
how existence ideal whole accounted for? existence principle renders relations possible itself determined none them eternal self-consciousness knows whole know part
god world humans world becomes
human experience god gradually made manifest
moral philosophy carrying same analytical method area moral philosophy green argued ethics applies peculiar conditions social life—that investigation human nature metaphysics began
faculty employed further investigation no separate moral faculty same reason source our knowledge ethical other
self-reflection gradually reveals us human capacity human function consequently human responsibility
brings out clear consciousness certain potentialities realisation human's true good must consist
result analysis combined investigation surroundings humans live content—a moral code—becomes gradually evolved
personal good perceived realisable making real actual conceptions thus arrived
long these remain potential ideal form motive action motive consisting idea end good humans present themselves end attainment satisfied realisation find true self
determination realise self definite way constitutes act will thus constituted neither arbitrary nor externally determined
motive may cause lies person himself identification self such motive self-determination once both rational free
freedom man constituted supposed ability anything may choose power identify himself true good reason reveals true good
good consists realisation personal character hence final good
moral ideal whole realised society persons while remaining ends themselves sense their individuality lost rendered perfect find perfection attainable separate individualities integrated part social whole
society necessary form persons persons constitute society
social union indispensable condition development special capacities individual members
human self-perfection cannot gained isolation attainable inter-relation fellow-citizens social community
law our being revealed involves turn civic political duties
moral goodness cannot limited still less constituted cultivation self-regarding virtues consists attempt realise practice moral ideal self-analysis revealed us our ideal
fact arises ground political obligation because institutions political civic life concrete embodiment moral ideas terms our day generation
since society exists proper development persons criterion test these institutions—namely contribute development moral character individual citizens? obvious final moral ideal realised any body civic institutions actually existing same analysis demonstrates deficiency points out direction true development will take
hence arises conception rights duties should maintained law opposed those actually maintained further consequence may become occasionally moral duty rebel against state interest state itself—that order better subserve end function constitutes raison d'être state
there exists general will desire common good cannot easily reconciled there antagonism common good private good such
interest common good various forms necessary produce good neutralise render useful other desires interests
basis conceived coercive authority imposed upon citizens without seen necessary restriction individual liberty light social contract consists spiritual recognition metaphysics part citizens constitutes their true nature conceptions complicating factors elaborating questions concerning will force basis state
citizen rights against state private rights
right life liberty right state over individual war right state punish right state promote morality right state regard property right state regard family
philosophy state action green believed state should foster protect social political economic environments individuals will best chance acting according their consciences
state must careful deciding liberties curtail ways curtail them
over-enthusiastic clumsy state intervention easily close down opportunities conscientious action thereby stifling moral development individual
state should intervene there clear proven strong tendency liberty enslave individual
even such hazard identified green tended favour action affected community itself rather national state action itself — local councils municipal authorities tended produce measures imaginative better suited daily reality social problem
hence favoured local option local people decided issuing liquor licences their area through their town councils
green stressed need specific solutions tailored fit specific problems
stressed there no eternal solutions no timeless division responsibilities national local governmental units
distribution responsibilities should guided imperative enable many individuals possible exercise their conscientious wills particular contingent circumstances way possible foster individual self-realisation long-run
deciding distribution responsibilities matter practical politics ethical political philosophy
experience may show local municipal levels unable control harmful influences say brewery industry
show national state should take responsibility area public policy
green argued ultimate power decide allocation such tasks should rest national state britain instance embodied parliament
national state itself legitimate green extent upholds system rights obligations most likely foster individual self-realisation
yet most appropriate structure system determined neither purely political calculation nor philosophical speculation
accurate say arose underlying conceptual normative structure one's particular society
