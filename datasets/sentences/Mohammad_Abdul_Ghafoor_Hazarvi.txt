works abdul ghafoor hazarvi translated numerous books variety subjects
amongst famous works compilation manaqib-al-jaleela book islamic jurisprudence
abdul ghafoor hazarvi's works include tahqiq-ul-haq fi kalima-tul-haq truth kalima-tul-haq shamsul hidayah i'la kalimatillah fi bayan-e-wa ma uhilla bihi legharillah al fatuhat-us-samadiyyah divine bounties tasfiah mabain sunni wa shi'ah majmua fatawa ideology hazarvi's understanding islamic law presented concisely book manaqib-al-jaleela
jihad hazarvi believes there certain directives qur'an pertaining war specific muhammad certain specified peoples times particularly progeny abraham ishmaelites israelites nazarites
thus muhammad designated followers waged war against divinely specified peoples their time polytheists israelites nazarites arabia other jews christians et al
form divine punishment asked polytheists arabia submission islam condition exoneration others jizya submission political authority muslims exemption death punishment military protection dhimmis muslims
therefore after muhammad companions there no concept islam obliging muslims wage war propagation implementation islam
valid basis jihad through arms end oppression other measures failed
according jihad waged organised islamic state
no person party group take arms their hands purpose waging jihad under any circumstances
another corollary opinion death punishment apostasy also specifically recipients same divine punishment during muhammad's times—for persistently denied truth muhammad's mission even after made conclusively evident them god through muhammad
formation islamic state religious obligation per se upon muslims
however believes muslims form state their own islam does impose certain religious obligations rulers establishment institution salat obligatory prayer zakah mandatory charity 'amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa nahi 'ani'l-munkar preservation promotion society's good conventions customs eradication social vices hazarvi's opinion should done modern times through courts police etc
accordance law land government itself must based opinion majority
qur'an states norms male-female interaction surah an-nur
while surah al-ahzab there special directives wives muhammad directives given muslim women distinguish themselves being harassed medina
qur'an created distinction men women maintain family relations relationships
penal laws islamic punishments hudud islamic law maximum pronouncements mitigated court law basis extenuating circumstances
shariah divine law does stipulate any fixed amount diyya monetary compensation unintentional murder determination amount—for unintentional murder man woman—has left conventions society
ceteris paribus other things being equal woman's testimony equal man's
rape hirabah deserves severe punishments mentioned quran 533
doesn't require four witnesses register case case zina arabic consensual sex
those punished stoning rajm muhammad's time also punished under hirabah raping sexually assaulting women spreading vulgarity society through prostitution
sources islam islam constituted qur'an sunnah
nothing besides these two islam regarded part
just like quran sunnah way prophet muslim nation received through ijma consensus companions prophet tawatur perpetual adherence muslim nation
unlike quran sunnah ahadith explain elucidate contained these two sources also describe exemplary way muhammad followed islam
sharia distinguished fiqh latter being collections interpretations applications sharia muslim jurists
fiqh characterised human exercise therefore subject human weakness differences opinion
muslim obliged adhere school fiqh
