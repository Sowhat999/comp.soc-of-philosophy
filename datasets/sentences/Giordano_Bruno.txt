outermost text reads heavenly empire dwelling god selected first half 15 th century nicholas cusa challenged then widely accepted philosophies aristotelianism envisioning instead infinite universe whose center everywhere circumference nowhere moreover teeming countless stars
also predicted neither rotational orbits circular nor their movements uniform
[citation needed] second half 16 th century theories copernicus 1473–1543 began diffusing through europe
copernicus conserved idea planets fixed solid spheres considered apparent motion stars illusion caused rotation earth axis also preserved notion immobile center sun rather earth
copernicus also argued earth planet orbiting sun once every year
however maintained ptolemaic hypothesis orbits planets composed perfect circles—deferents epicycles—and stars fixed stationary outer sphere
[citation needed] despite widespread publication copernicus' work de revolutionibus orbium coelestium during bruno's time most educated catholics subscribed aristotelian geocentric view earth center universe heavenly bodies revolved around
ultimate limit universe primum mobile whose diurnal rotation conferred upon transcendental god part universe although kingdom heaven adjacent motionless prime mover first cause
fixed stars part celestial sphere same fixed distance immobile earth center sphere

planets each fixed transparent sphere

particular support copernican view oppose objection according motion earth perceived means motion winds clouds etc
cena de le ceneri bruno anticipates arguments galilei relativity principle

capable comprehension therefore endless limitless extent infinite indeterminable consequently immobile

bruno mouth character philotheo de l'infinito universo et mondi 1584 claims innumerable celestial bodies stars globes suns earths may sensibly perceived therein us infinite number them may inferred our own reason
max tegmark parallel universes 2003 max bernhard weinsten welt- und lebensanschauungen hervorgegangen aus religion philosophie und naturerkenntnis world life views emerging religion philosophy nature 1910 p
321 also darf man vielleicht glauben daß das ganze system eine erhebung des physischen aus seiner natur das göttliche ist oder eine durchstrahlung des physischen durch das göttliche beides eine art pandeismus
und zeigt sich auch begriff gottes von dem des universums nicht getrennt gott ist naturierende natur weltseele weltkraft
da bruno durchaus ablehnt gegen die religion zu lehren hat man solche angaben wohl umgekehrt zu verstehen weltkraft weltseele naturierende natur universum sind gott
gott ist kraft weltkraft seele weltseele natur natur eins des universums
bruno spricht ja auch von mehreren teilen universellen vernunft des urvermögens und urwirklichkeit
und damit hängt zusammen daß für ihn die welt unendlich ist und ohne anfang und ende sie ist demselben sinne allumfassend wie gott
aber nicht ganz wie gott
gott sei allem und im einzelnen allumfassend die welt jedoch wohl allem aber nicht im einzelnen da sie ja teile sich zuläßt
