carbon telephone transmitter 1877–78 edison invented developed carbon microphone used telephones along bell receiver until 1980 s
after protracted patent litigation 1892 federal court ruled edison emile berliner inventor carbon microphone
carbon microphone also used radio broadcasting public address work through 1920 s
[citation needed] electric light main article history light bulb thomas edison's first successful light bulb model used public demonstration menlo park december 1879 1878 edison began working system electrical illumination something hoped compete gas oil based lighting
began tackling problem creating long lasting incandescent lamp something needed indoor use
many earlier inventors previously devised incandescent lamps including alessandro volta's demonstration glowing wire 1800 inventions henry woodward mathew evans
others developed early commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included humphry davy james bowman lindsay moses g
farmer william e
sawyer joseph swan heinrich göbel
these early bulbs such flaws extremely short life high expense produce high electric current drawn making them difficult apply large scale commercially
217–218 edison realized order keep thickness copper wire needed connect series electric lights economically manageable size come up lamp draw low amount current
meant lamp high resistance run low voltage around 110 volts
after many experiments first carbon filaments then platinum other metals end edison returned carbon filament
first successful test october 1879186 lasted 13
5 hours
edison continued improve design november 4 1879 filed u
patent 223898 granted january 27 1880 electric lamp using carbon filament strip coiled connected platina contact wires
first commercially practical incandescent light
although patent described several ways creating carbon filament including cotton linen thread wood splints papers coiled various ways until several months after patent granted edison team discovered carbonized bamboo filament last over 1200 hours
idea using particular raw material originated edison's recalling examination few threads bamboo fishing pole while relaxing shore battle lake present-day state wyoming other members scientific team traveled clearly observe total eclipse sun july 29 1878 continental divide

1878 edison formed edison electric light company new york city several financiers including j
morgan members vanderbilt family
edison made first public demonstration incandescent light bulb december 31 1879 menlo park
during time will make electricity cheap rich will burn candles
oregon railroad navigation company's new steamship columbia first commercial application edison's incandescent light bulb 1880
henry villard president oregon railroad navigation company attended edison's 1879 demonstration
villard quickly became impressed requested edison install electric lighting system aboard company's new steamer columbia
although hesitant first edison relented agreed villard's request
following most completion may 1880 columbia sent new york city edison personnel installed columbia's new lighting system
due columbia became edison's first commercial application incandescent light bulb
edison equipment eventually removed columbia 1895
lewis latimer joined edison electric light company 1884
latimer received patent january 1881 process manufacturing carbons improved method production carbon filaments lightbulbs
latimer worked engineer draftsman expert witness patent litigation electric lights
george westinghouse's company bought philip diehl's competing induction lamp patent rights 1882 $25000 forcing holders edison patent charge reasonable rate use edison patent rights lowering price electric lamp
october 1883 us patent office ruled edison's patent based work william sawyer therefore invalid

1891 henry ford joined edison illuminating company engineer became chief engineer 1895
during time ford became interested automobiles developed first car spare time quadricycle driven gasoline internal combustion engine
edison impressed ford's work gas powered automobiles encouraged developments
electric power distribution after devising commercially viable electric light bulb october 21 1879 edison went develop electric utility designed compete then existent gas lighting utilities
december 17 1880 founded edison illuminating company during 1880 s patented system electricity distribution
company established first investor-owned electric utility 1882 pearl street station new york city
september 4 1882 edison switched pearl street generating station's electrical power distribution system provided 110 volts direct current dc 59 customers lower manhattan
earlier year january 1882 switched first steam-generating power station holborn viaduct london
dc supply system provided electricity supplies street lamps several private dwellings within short distance station
january 19 1883 first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service roselle new jersey
war currents main article war currents extravagant displays electric lights quickly became feature public events picture 1897 tennessee centennial exposition
edison expanding direct current dc power delivery system began receiving stiff competition companies installing alternating current ac systems
early 1880 s ac arc lighting systems streets large spaces expanding business us
development transformers europe westinghouse electric us 1885-1886 became possible transmit ac very long distances over thinner cheaper wires step down voltage destination distribution users
allowed ac used street lighting also lighting small business domestic customers market edison's patented low voltage dc incandescent lamp system designed supply
edison's dc empire began suffering chief drawbacks suitable high density customers found large cities
edison's dc plants deliver electricity customers mile plant short range left patchwork un-supplied customers in-between plants
small cities rural areas afford edison style system
left large part market without electrical service ac companies expanding gap
edison expressed views ac unworkable high voltages used dangerous
george westinghouse installing first ac systems 1886 thomas edison began pattern striking out personally against chief rival stating just certain death westinghouse will kill customer within six months after puts system any size
got new thing will require great deal experimenting get working practically
many reasons put forward edison's anti-ac stance
notion inventor may able grasp abstract theories behind ac trying avoid developing system understand
edison also appeared worried high voltage competitor's misinstalled ac system killing customers hurting sales electric power systems general
top simple fact edison electric based their entire design low voltage dc switching standard after installed over 100 systems edison's mind out question
end 1887 edison electric beginning lose market share westinghouse built 68 ac-based power stations edison's 121 dc-based stations
make matters worse edison thomson-houston electric company lynn massachusetts another ac-based competitor built power stations
parallel expanding competition edison ac companies rising public furor over series deaths spring 1888 caused pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines turned media frenzy against current seemingly greedy callous lighting companies used
edison took advantage public perception ac dangerous teamed up self-styled new york anti-ac crusader harold p
brown propaganda campaign aiding brown public electrocution animals ac well supported legislation control severely limit ac installations voltages point making ineffective power delivery system now being referred battle currents
development electric chair used attempt portray ac having greater lethal potential dc smear westinghouse same time via edison colluding brown westinghouse's chief ac rival thomson-houston electric company make sure first electric chair powered westinghouse ac generator
thomas edison's staunch anti-ac tactics sitting well own stock holders
early 1890 s edison's company generating much smaller profits ac rivals war currents come end 1892 edison being forced out controlling own company
year financier j p morgan engineered merger edison general electric thomson-houston basically put board thomson-houston charge new company called general electric dropping edison name
general electric now controlled three quarters us electrical business go compete westinghouse ac market
other inventions projects fluoroscopy edison credited designing producing first commercially available fluoroscope machine uses x-rays take radiographs
until edison discovered calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images barium platinocyanide screens originally used wilhelm röntgen technology capable producing very faint images
