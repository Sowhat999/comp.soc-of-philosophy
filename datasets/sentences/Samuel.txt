upon hearing news capture ark covenant death sons eli collapsed died
philistines possession ark seven months visited calamities misfortunes decided return ark israelites
according bruce c
birch samuel key figure keeping israelites religious heritage identity alive during israel's defeat occupation philistines
[i]t may possible necessary samuel exercise authority roles normally converge single individual priest prophet judge
after 20 years oppression samuel gained national prominence prophet samuel 320 summoned people hill mizpah led them against philistines
philistines having marched mizpah attack newly amassed israelite army soundly defeated fled terror
retreating philistines slaughtered israelites bible portrays positively
text then states samuel erected large stone battle site memorial there ensued long period peace thereafter
king-maker samuel initially appointed two sons successors however just like eli's sons samuel's prove unworthy
israelites rejected them
because external threat other tribes such philistines tribal leaders decided there need unified central government demanded samuel appoint king like other nations
samuel interprets personal rejection first reluctant oblige until reassured divine revelation
warns people potential negative consequences such decision
samuel known chozeh seer believed endowed true spiritual insight contrast false prophets enchanters magicians neighboring nations
saul servant searching father's lost asses servant suggested consulting nearby samuel
samuel recognized saul future king
just before retirement samuel gathered people assembly gilgal gave them farewell speech emphasised how prophets judges important kings how kings should held account how people should fall idol worship worship asherah baal samuel threatened god subject people foreign invaders should disobey
seen deuteronomic redaction since archaeological finds indicate asherah still worshipped israelite households well 6 th century
however bible says kings 115 33 2 kings 2313 israelites fell asherah worship later

prophecies saul's rule will see no dynastic succession
during campaign against amalekites king saul spared agag king amalekites best their livestock
saul tells samuel spared choicest amalekites' sheep oxen intending sacrifice livestock lord
violation lord's command pronounced samuel
utterly destroy spare them slay both man woman infant suckling ox sheep camel ass samuel 153
samuel confronts saul disobedience tells god made king god unmake king
samuel then proceeded execute agag
saul never saw samuel alive again after
apparition spirit samuel saul salvator rosa 1668
samuel then proceeds bethelehem secretly anoints david king
later provide sanctuary david jealous saul first tried killed
samuel died buried ramah
according classical rabbinical sources age fifty-two
saul later witch endor conjure samuel's ghost order predict result up-coming battle
passage ascribed textual scholars republican source
classical rabbinical sources say samuel terrified ordeal having expected appearing face god's judgement therefore brought moses land living witness adherence mitzvot
source criticism national prophet local seer authors see biblical samuel combining descriptions two distinct roles seer based ramah seemingly known scarcely beyond immediate neighbourhood ramah saul example having heard servant informing existence instead
role samuel associated bands musical ecstatic roaming prophets nevi'im - neb'im gibeah bethel gilgal traditional scholars argued samuel founder these groups
ramah samuel secretly anoints saul after having met first time while saul looking father's lost donkeys treated meal
prophet based shiloh went throughout land place place unwearied zeal reproving rebuking exhorting people repentance
role samuel acted biblical judge publicly advising nation also giving private advice individuals
eventually samuel delegates role sons based beersheba behave corruptly people facing invasion ammonites persuade samuel appoint king
samuel reluctantly does anoints saul front entire nation gathered see
source-critical scholarship suggests these two roles come different sources later spliced together form books samuel
oldest considered marks samuel local seer ramah willingly anoints saul king secret while latter presents samuel national figure begrudgingly anoints saul king front national assembly
later source generally known republican source since here elsewhere denigrates actions role monarchy particularly those saul favours religious figures contrast other main source monarchial source treats monarchy favourably
theoretically monarchial source see saul appointed king public acclamation due military victories cleromancy involving samuel
another difference sources republican source treats shouters somewhat independent samuel samuel 9 rather having led samuel 1918 ff
passage samuel described having exercised functions biblical judge during annual circuit ramah bethel gilgal gilgal ebal gerizim mizpah back ramah foreshadowed deborah used render judgments place beneath palm ramah bethel
source-critical scholarship considers redaction aimed harmonizing two portrayals samuel
books samuel variously describe samuel having carried out sacrifices sanctuaries having constructed sanctified altars
according priestly code/deuteronomic code aaronic priests/levites depending underling tradition permitted perform these actions simply being nazarite prophet insufficient
books samuel kings offer numerous examples rule followed kings prophets critical scholars look elsewhere seeking harmonization issues
book chronicles samuel described levite rectifying situation however critical scholarship widely sees book chronicles attempt redact books samuel kings conform later religious sensibilities
since many biblical law codes themselves thought postdate books samuel according documentary hypothesis chronicles probably making claim based religious bias
levitical genealogy chronicles 4 historical according modern scholarship
deuteronomistic historians' portrait samuel deuteronomistic historians redacted former prophets joshua judges & 2 samuel & 2 kings idealized samuel figure larger life like joshua
samuel's father elkanah described having originated zuph specifically ramathaim-zophim part tribal lands ephraim while books chronicles state levite
samuel judge leads military like book judges also exercises judicial functions
sam 126-17 deuteronomic historians composed speech samuel puts judge sent god save israel
samuel 96-20 samuel seen local “seer
deuteronomistic historians preserved view samuel while contributing “the first prophets articulate failure israel live up covenant god
deuteronomistic historians samuel extension moses continuing moses’ function prophet judge priest made historical samuel uncertain
adrian zindiargued samuel prophet god
perspectives samuel grave prophet samuel jerusalem judaism according book jeremiah psalms 99 samuel high devotion god
classical rabbinical literature adds equal moses god speaking directly samuel rather samuel having attend tabernacle hear god
samuel also described rabbis having extremely intelligent argued legitimate laymen slaughter sacrifices since halakha insisted priests bring blood cf leviticus 15 zebahim
eli viewed negatively many classical rabbis reacted logic samuel arguing technically true samuel should put death making legal statements while eli mentor present
samuel also treated classical rabbis much sympathetic character appears face value bible annual circuit explained being due wish spare people task having journey samuel very rich taking entire household circuit didn't need impose himself anyone's hospitality saul fell out god's favour samuel described having grieved copiously having prematurely aged

according islamic history israelites after time prophet moses wanted king rule over their country

qur'an states you thought elders israel after moses how their apostle set up king us then shall fight way god? replied too possible commanded fight you may fight
how should fight way god driven our homes deprived our sons? ordered fight turned away except few yet god knows sinners
— qur'an sura 2 al-baqara ayah 246 qur'an goes state king anointed prophet whose name talut saul hebrew bible
