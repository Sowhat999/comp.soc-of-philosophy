writing approach ethics friedrich nietzsche 1844–1900 williams wished quote every twenty minutes
williams turned back meta-ethics studied moral philosophers western analytic tradition instead tried address question how live focusing complexity everyday life
morality introduction ethics 1972 whereas most moral philosophy most times empty boring
[c]ontemporary moral philosophy found original way being boring discussing moral issues
study ethics argued should vital compelling
wanted find approach accountable psychology history politics culture
rejection morality discrete separable domain human thought peculiar institution called williams resembled 19 th-century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche someone wished quote every twenty minutes
although disdain reductionism make appear moral relativist far
believed like ancient greeks called thick ethical concepts such cruelty faithfulness real union fact value
critique utilitarianism further information utilitarianism act utilitarianism rule utilitarianism preference utilitarianism williams particularly critical utilitarianism consequentialist position simplest version actions good insofar promote greatest happiness greatest number
arguments against utilitarianism complex manifold yet seem focus consequentialist structure
example hypothesized williams take case jim botanist doing research south american country led brutal dictator
unfortunately jim eventually finds himself small town facing 20 indian rebels captured tied up examples will happen others
captain arrested them says jim will kill others will released honour jim's status guest does will killed
simple act utilitarianism favour jim killing men
against williams argued there crucial moral distinction person being killed me being killed someone else because act omission mine
utilitarian loses distinction turning us empty vessels means consequences occur rather preserving our status moral actors
argued moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity integrity
judge actions their consequences argued
indeed should reject any system reduces moral decision-making few algorithms because any systematisation reduction will distort complexity
additionally playing off inherent complexity moral world seen williams reductionist element broadly reach certainty merely typical utilitarian thought moral theorising generally
ongoing appeal williams human identity nature contrast objectivity characteristic ethical thought continuing motif williams illustrative general scepticism field
elusiveness depth true moral situations often unappreciated realised standard theorising according williams
critique kantianism immanuel kant 1724–1804 main alternatives utilitarian theory moral philosophy 18 th-century german philosopher immanuel kant
williams's work throughout 1970 s 1980 s outlined basis attacks twin pillars utilitarianism kantianism morality introduction ethics 1972 problems self 1973 utilitarianism against j
smart 1973 moral luck 1981 ethics limits philosophy 1985
martha nussbaum work denounced trivial evasive way moral philosophy being practised england under aegis those two dominant theories
kant's critique practical reason groundwork metaphysic morals expounded moral system based categorical imperative
although kant formulated exactly several times best-known version act maxim your action become act will universal law nature
williams argued against categorical imperative paper persons character morality
morality should require us act abstract character though circumstances presently find ourselves
should take impartial view world necessarily expected cast aside our individuality
reasons action further information internalism externalism § reasons williams's insistence morality people their real lives acting out rational self-interest even selfishness contrary moral action illustrated internal reasons action argument part philosophers call internal/external reasons debate
philosophers tried argue moral agents external reasons performing moral act able act reasons independent their inner mental states
williams argued meaningless
something reason act must magnetic must move people action
williams argued something entirely external us example proposition x good cannot because cognition belief magnetic person must feel something before moved act
argued reasons action internal boil down desire
truth final completed book truth truthfulness essay genealogy 2002 williams identifies two basic values truth accuracy sincerity tries address gulf demand truth doubt any such thing exists
guardian obituary williams book examination those sneer any purported truth ludicrously naive because inevitably distorted power class bias ideology
debt nietzsche clear most obviously adoption genealogical method tool explanation critique
although part intention attack those felt denied value truth book cautions understand simply sense miss part purpose rather kenneth baker williams' reflection moral cost intellectual vogue dispensing concept truth
legacy williams propose any systematic philosophical theory indeed suspicious any such attempt
daniel callcut writes extent williams' impact easily underestimated since spread across many distinct subfields now constitute professional philosophy
yet also case spite influence williams remained throughout life something renegade within english-language philosophy ideas generated many research program there large amount philosophy conducted might call williamsian spirit
things distinguish williams’ work many contemporaries way brings together aspects moral philosophy tend get separated distinction metaethics normative ethics
work explores implications ethics truths ethical historical cultural political psychological biological
work thus able reveal wrestle otherwise remain merely latent tensions influential positions metaethics normative ethics
alan thomas writes williams' contribution ethics overarching scepticism attempts create foundation moral philosophy explicitly articulated ethics limits philosophy 1985 shame necessity 1993 argued moral theories never reflect complexities life particularly given radical pluralism modern societies
jonathan lear writes williams wanted understand human beings part natural world fundamental starting point moral reflection individual perspective internal reasons action
try transcend one's point view williams argued leads self-deception
secular humanist tradition no appeal external moral authority god ideas strike foundation conventional morality namely sometimes does good even does want blamed failure
timothy chappell writes without external reasons action becomes impossible argue same set moral reasons applies agents equally because agent's reasons judged according their lives led their internal reasons action
cases someone no internal reason others see right thing cannot blamed failing because internal reasons reasons blame williams involves treating person blamed like someone reason right thing
chappell writes learning yourself authentic act integrity rather conforming any external moral system arguably fundamental motif williams's work
there's theme my work it's authenticity self-expression williams 2002
it's idea things real sense really you express you others aren't
whole thing spelling out notion inner necessity
