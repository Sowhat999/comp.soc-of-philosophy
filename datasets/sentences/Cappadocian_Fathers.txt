made key contributions doctrine trinity responses arianism apollinarianism
subsequent first council nicea arianism simply disappear
council nicea asserted son same substance homoousios father
semi-arians taught son like substance father homoiousios against outright arians taught son like father created therefore god
son held like father same essence father
cappadocians worked bring these semi-arians back orthodox cause
their writings made extensive use now orthodox formula substance ousia three persons hypostaseis
relationship understandable argued basil caesarea parallel drawn platonism any three human beings each individual persons share common universal their humanity
formulation explicitly acknowledged distinction father son holy spirit distinction nicea accused blurring same time insisting their essential unity
thus basil brief statement shall say essence ousia related person hypostasis general particular
each us partakes existence because shares ousia while because individual properties
case question ousia refers general conception like goodness godhead such notions while hypostasis observed special properties fatherhood sonship sanctifying power
then speak persons without hypostasis talking nonsense ex hypothesi admit person exists real hypostasis acknowledge let them number them preserve principles homoousion unity godhead proclaim their reverent acknowledgment father son holy spirit complete perfect hypostasis each person named
—epistle 214
basil thus attempted justice doctrinal definitions nicea while same time distinguishing nicene position modalism arius's original charge against pope alexander nicene controversy
outcome arianism semi-arianism virtually disappeared church
