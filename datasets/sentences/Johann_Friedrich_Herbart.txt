growing up fragile child because unfortunate accident herbart taught mother home until age 12
continued schooling gymnasium six years showed interest philosophy logic kant's work involving nature knowledge obtained experience reality
education then continued jena whereupon studied philosophy came disagree teacher fichte precisely because fichte taught think logical manner
composed few essays given fichte during years jena criticising works schelling advocating contention german idealism promoted others like kant time
leaving jena after three years tutored children herr von steiger governor interlaken
during these three years tutoring job sparked interest educational reform
while tutoring switzerland herbart met came know pestalozzi swiss educator involved issues reform schools
resigning tutoring position herbart went study greek mathematics bremen three years then eventually moved attend göttingen 1801 1809
while there received privat-docent endeavours educational studies after receiving doctoral degree
gave first philosophical lectures gottingen around 1805 whence removed 1809 occupy chair formerly held kant königsberg
here also established conducted seminary pedagogy till 1833 returned once göttingen remained there professor philosophy till death
herbart gave last lecture perfectly good health then unexpectedly died two days later apoplexy
buried albanifriedhof cemetery göttingen
herbart very much focused studies “he barely saw world outside study classrooms” making “his world world books books”
regardless relentless studying met eighteen-year-old english girl named mary drake night playing game charades
became acquainted her asked her her hand marriage
lived happy life mary supporting her husband’s pursuits contributions fields pedagogy psychology
philosophy philosophy according herbart begins reflection upon our empirical conceptions consists reformation elaboration these three primary divisions being determined many distinct forms elaboration
logic stands first render our conceptions judgments reasonings arising them clear distinct
conceptions such distinct made contradictory their elements become change supplement these make them length thinkable problem second part philosophy metaphysics
there still class conceptions requiring logical treatment differing last involving latent contradictions being independent reality their objects conceptions embody our judgments approval disapproval philosophic treatment these conceptions falls under aesthetics
logic herbart's writings logic receives comparatively meagre notice insisted strongly purely formal character expressed himself main kantians such fries krug
metaphysics metaphysician starts terms higher scepticism humean–kantian sphere thought beginnings discerns locke's perplexity idea substance
validity even forms experience called question account contradictions found involve
yet these forms given us truly sensations follows beyond doubt consider little able control other
attempt stage psychological inquiry origin these conceptions doubly mistake should use these unlegitimated conceptions course task clearing up their contradictions still remain whether succeeded our enquiry
how set task? given us conception uniting among constituent marks two prove contradictory say m n neither deny unity nor reject contradictory members
either forbidden experience yet nothing forbidden logic
thus driven assumption conception contradictory because incomplete how supplement it? must point way want our procedure will arbitrary
experience asserts m same
mark same concept n while logic denies being impossible same m sustain these contradictory positions there way open us must posit several ms
even now cannot say these ms same n another every m must both thinkable valid
may however take ms singly together again no other course being open us must must assume n results combination ms
herbart's method relations counterpart system hegelian dialectic
ontology method employed determine reality corresponds empirical conceptions substance cause rather inherence change
first must analyse notion reality itself our scepticism already led us though doubt whether given appears cannot doubt something conception real thus consists two conceptions being quality
compelled posit cannot sublated recognition lies simple conception being
thing thus posited? posited usually posit things see taste handle
without sensations
never bound against our will endure persistence presentation should never know being
keeping fast hold idea absolute position herbart leads us next quality real must exclude everything negative non-a sublates instead positing absolute relative
real must absolutely simple contain two determinations then either these reducible true quality each conditioned other their position no longer absolute
quantitative conceptions excluded quantity implies parts these incompatible simplicity
there may plurality reals albeit mere conception being tell us nothing
doctrine here developed first cardinal point herbart's system name pluralistic realism proposed otto pfleiderer
contradictions finds common-sense conception inherence thing several attributes will now become obvious
take thing say having n attributes c
forced posit each these because each presented intuition
conceiving make n positions still less n+1 positions position simply common sense removes absolute position original source sensation
ask posited? possessor c other words their seat substance
then real being simple must equal similarly must
now possible c
contingent aspects example 23 √64 4+3+1 contingent aspects
such course case many contradictions there attributes must say etc
there must then according method relations several
let us assume a1+a1+a1
now relation there among these several will restore us unity our original substance? there just must assume first every series identical just centre same point every radius
way concrete illustration herbart instances “the common observation properties things exist under external conditions
bodies say coloured color nothing without light nothing without eyes
sound vibrating medium healthy ears
colour tone present appearance inherence looking closer find really immanent things rather presuppose communion among several
result then briefly thus place absolute position unthinkable way common understanding substitutes absolute positions n attributes really series two positions each attribute every series however beginning same central real hence unity substance group attributes each being continued different reals hence plurality difference attributes unity substance
there appearance inherence therefore there plurality reals no such correlative substance attribute accident admitted
substantiality impossible without causality true correlative now turn
common-sense conception change involves bottom same contradiction opposing qualities real
same c
experience thrusts upon us proves reflection unthinkable
metaphysical supplementing also fundamentally before
since c depended series reals a3+a3+a3
connection may similarly depend series a4+a4+a4
then change c means central real any real changed now connection a4 etc
no longer connection a3 etc
think number reals connection zusammensein will suffice explanation phenomena something other must happen connection it? answer question second hinge-point herbart's theoretical philosophy
actually happens distinct seems happen two reals together assuming them differ quality tend disturb each other extent difference same time each preserves itself intact resisting others disturbance
coining connection different reals self-preservations will vary accordingly remaining same through just way illustration hydrogen remains same water ammonia same line may now normal now tangent
indicate opposition qualities reals a+b must substitute these symbols others though contingent aspects
representing their relations themselves yet like similar devices mathematics enable thought advance
thus may put = α+β-γ = m+n+γ γ then represents character self-preservations case α+β+m+n represents observed spectator know simple qualities himself involved relations such exactly our position
having thus determined really actually happens our philosopher proceeds next explain synthetically objective semblance objective schein results these
construction truly objective
valid intelligences ontology must furnish us clue
forms space time motion involved whenever think reals being coming connection opposite
these forms then cannot merely products our psychological mechanism though may turn out coincide these
meanwhile let us call them intelligible being valid comprehend real actual thought although no such forms predicable real actual themselves
elementary spatial relation herbart conceives “the contiguity aneinander two points” every “pure independent line” discrete
investigation dependent lines often incommensurable forces us adopt contradictory fiction partially overlapping
divisible points other words conception continuity
[note 1] contradiction here cannot eliminate method relations because does involve anything real fact necessary outcome intelligible form fiction continuity valid objective semblance
help enabled comprehend actually happens among reals produce appearance water
three reals together each disturbance self-preservation will general imperfect
less intensity two reals together
objective semblance corresponds reality spatial external relations reals case must therefore tally their inner actual states
self-preservations perfect coincidence space complete group reals inextended several reals simply contiguous
without connection then nothing actually happened nothing appear
shall find continuous molecule manifesting attractive repulsive forces attraction corresponding tendency self-preservations become perfect repulsion frustration
motion even evidently space implicates contradictory conception continuity cannot therefore real predicate though valid intelligible form necessary comprehension objective semblance
think reals absolutely independent yet entering connections
conceiving them originally moving through intelligible space rectilinear paths uniform velocities
such motion no cause need supposed motion fact no state moving real rest both alike being relations therefore real no concern
changes motion however should require cause objective semblance self-preservations actually occur reals meet
further means such motion these actual occurrences themselves timeless fall observer definite time — time becomes continuous through partial coincidence events
assumed spectators objective semblance remains make good assumption other words show possibility knowledge problem herbart terms eidolology forms transition metaphysic psychology
here again contradictory conception blocks way viz
ego identity knowing being such stronghold idealism
contradiction becomes evident ego denned subject real own object
real merely formal conception ego amenable method relations
solution method furnishes summarily there several objects mutually modify each other constitute ego take presented real
explain modification business psychology enough now see subject like reals necessarily unknown therefore idealist's theory knowledge unsound
though simple quality subject soul beyond knowledge know actually happens connection other's reals self-preservations then call sensations
these sensations sole material our knowledge given us chaos definite groups series whence come know relations those reals though themselves unknown our sensations compel us posit absolutely
principles education herbart's pedagogy emphasised connection individual development resulting societal contribution
platonic tradition herbart espoused becoming productive citizens people fulfill their true purpose “he believed every child born unique potential individuality potential remained unfulfilled until analysed transformed education accordance regarded accumulated values civilisation”
formalised rigorous education believed provide framework moral intellectual development
five key ideas composed concept individual maturation inner freedom perfection benevolence justice equity recompense
according herbart abilities innate instilled thorough education provide framework moral intellectual development
order develop educational paradigm provide intellectual base lead consciousness social responsibility herbart advocated teachers utilise methodology five formal steps “using structure teacher prepared topic interest children presented topic questioned them inductively reached new knowledge based already known looked back deductively summed up lesson’s achievements then related them moral precepts daily living”
order appeal learners’ interests herbart advocated using literature historical stories instead drier basal readers popular time
whereas moralistic tales many primers readers period predictable allegorical herbart felt children appreciate psychological literary nuances masterpieces canon
though died 1841 pedagogy enjoyed renaissance sorts mid- 19 th century while germany intellectual centre “found ready echo those countries such united kingdom france united states development individuality character appeared particularly well attuned prevailing economic political social circumstances”
combination individual potentiality civic responsibility seemed reflect democratic ideals
though emphasis character building through literary appreciation diminished somewhat after movement toward utilitarianism following first world war herbart's pedagogy continues influence field raising important questions role critical thinking literary appreciation education
aesthetics ethics aesthetics elaborates ideas involved expression called forth those relations object acquire them attribution beauty reverse
beautiful carefully distinguished allied conceptions useful pleasant vary time place person whereas beauty predicated absolutely involuntarily attained right standpoint
ethics branch aesthetics although chief deals such relations among volitions willensverhältnisse thus unconditionally please displease
these relations herbart finds reducible five admit further simplification corresponding them many moral ideas musterbegriffe follows internal freedom underlying relation being individual's will judgment perfection relation being several volitions each other respect intensity variety concentration benevolence relation being own will thought another's right case actual conflict other retribution equity intended good evil ideas final society system rewards punishments system administration system culture animated society corresponding ideas law equity benevolence perfection internal freedom respectively result take account number individuals
virtue perfect conformity will moral ideas single virtues special expressions
conception duty arises existence hindrances attainment virtue
general scheme principles conduct possible sublimation special cases under these must remain matter fact
application ethics things view realisation moral ideas moral technology tugendlehre chief divisions paedagogy politics
theology theology herbart held argument design valid divine activity human justify belief supersensible real concerning however exact knowledge neither tenable nor practical grounds desirable
psychology herbart's concept real building upon teaching methods pestalozzi herbart contributed pedagogy psychological basis help facilitate better learning well ensure children’s character development
first individual point out how important role psychology plays education
developing ideas psychology herbart came disagree kant how true knowledge obtained
kant believed become knowledgeable through studying innate categories thought while herbart believed learns studying external real objects world well ideas come observing them
examining difference actual existence object appearance herbart concluded “the world world things-in-themselves [and] things-in-themselves perceivable
everything’s appearance indicates exists
considered external objects existing world reals compared leibniz's concept monads
subscribing locke's empiricist viewpoint involving tabula rasa herbart believed soul no innate ideas no already pre-established kantian categories thought
soul considered real thought completely passive initially well very resistant changes outside factors exert force upon
even though reals disrupted other forces appearing cause change reals themselves thought unchangeable
reals tend collide struggle another much each real fights own self-preservation selbsterhaltung
way soul helps preserve itself outwardly perceived destruction through herbart’s concept vorstellungen ideas mental representations
these ideas regarded dynamic forces herbart attempted explain means mathematical formulas
newton’s influence seen herbart’s beliefs how forces mechanically interact another world affect perceptions reality
mechanics ideas involved their ability move different ways whether moving up conscious delving down unconscious
different ideas come contact each other result complex ideas through processes blending fusing fading combining multitude approaches
evident herbart thought ideas precise imitations existing items world direct consequence interactions individuals’ experiences external environment
individual gain facts their associated truth understanding how their mental representations combine potentially inhibit contribute another
apperception herbart believed ideas crossed limen consciousness boundary conscious unconscious became clearer strong enough preserve themselves against their struggle other forces
ideas powerful enough break through conscious formed apperceiving mass congregation similar related ideas dominating conscious any given moment
expounding upon leibniz’s concept petites apperceptions idea apperception herbart believed apperceiving mass crucial selecting similar ideas down unconscious join forces conscious
although individual focusing his/her attention those complex ideas part apperceiving mass conscious possible ideas unconscious combine other ideas related them struggle break through limen conscious disrupting present ideas part apperceiving mass
apperception played key role herbart’s educational theory
saw apperception pivotal classroom sense-perception because focusing child’s apperceiving mass relation material being taught inform teachers how implement material such way direct child’s ideas thoughts attend certain information
