portable conservative reader 1982 kirk edited contains sample writings most above
everyone agreed kirk's reading conservative heritage tradition
example harry jaffa student leo strauss kirk poor burke scholar
burke's attack metaphysical reasoning related modern philosophy's attempt eliminate skeptical doubt premises hence conclusions
russello 2004 argues kirk adapted 19 th-century american catholic thinker orestes brownson called territorial democracy articulate version federalism based premises differ part those founders other conservatives
kirk further believed territorial democracy reconcile tension treating states mere provinces central government autonomous political units independent washington
finally territorial democracy allowed kirk set out theory individual rights grounded particular historical circumstances united states while rejecting universal conception such rights
principles kirk developed six canons conservatism russello 2004 described follows belief transcendent order kirk described variously based tradition divine revelation natural law affection variety mystery human existence conviction society requires orders classes emphasize natural distinctions belief property freedom closely linked faith custom convention prescription recognition innovation must tied existing traditions customs entails respect political value prudence
kirk christianity western civilization unimaginable apart another culture arises out religion
religious faith decays culture must decline though often seeming flourish space after religion nourished sunk disbelief
[not citation given] kirk libertarianism kirk grounded burkean conservatism tradition political philosophy belles lettres strong religious faith later years rather libertarianism free market economic reasoning
conservative mind hardly mentions economics
polemic essay kirk quoting t
eliot called libertarians chirping sectaries adding conservatives nothing common despite early correspondence libertarian isabel paterson
called libertarian movement ideological clique forever splitting sects still smaller odder rarely conjugating
line division exists believers sort transcendent moral order utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions conduct
included libertarians latter category
kirk therefore questioned fusionism libertarians traditional conservatives marked much post-world war ii conservatism united states
kirk's view classical liberals positive though agrees them ordered liberty make common cause regular conservatives against menace democratic despotism economic collectivism
tibor r
machan defended libertarianism response kirk's original heritage lecture
machan argued right individual sovereignty perhaps most worthy conserving american political heritage conservatives themselves talk preserving tradition cannot same time claim disrespectful distrust individual human mind rationalism itself
jacob g
hornberger future freedom foundation also responded kirk
kirk neoconservatism late life kirk grew disenchanted american neoconservatives well
chronicles editor scott richert describes [one line] helped define emerging struggle neoconservatives paleoconservatives
seldom seemed kirk declared eminent neoconservatives mistook tel aviv capital united states
no pointed out committed blunder geographical capital israel jerusalem tel aviv
few years later another heritage foundation speech kirk repeated line verbatim
wake gulf war opposed clearly understood those words carried even greater meaning
also commented neoconservatives often clever never wise
midge decter director committee free world called kirk's remark bloody outrage piece anti-semitism kirk impugns loyalty neoconservatives
she new republic it's notion christian civilization
you part you're really fit conserve anything
that's old line it's very ignorant
samuel t
francis called kirk's tel aviv remark wisecrack slavishly pro-israel sympathies among neoconservatives
described decter's response untrue reckless vitriolic
furthermore argued such denunciation plays hands left then able repeat charges claim conservative endorsement them
kirk gulf war toward end life russell kirk highly critical republican militarism
president bush kirk embarked upon radical course intervention region persian gulf
excerpts russell kirk's lectures heritage foundation 1992 presidents woodrow wilson franklin roosevelt lyndon johnson enthusiasts american domination world
now george bush appears emulating those eminent democrats
republicans once upon time nominated presidency world candidate wendell willkie sadly trounced
general republicans throughout twentieth century advocates prudence restraint conduct foreign affairs
unless bush administration abruptly reverses fiscal military course suggest republican party must lose former good repute frugality become party profligate expenditure butter guns
public opinion long abide
nor america's world influence america's remaining prosperity
yet presidents united states must encouraged make perpetual war perpetual peace nor fancy establish new world order through eliminating dissenters
second century before christ romans generously liberated greek city-states yoke macedonia
long before romans felt necessary impose upon those quarrelsome greeks domination stifling hellenic freedom culture ever macedon
