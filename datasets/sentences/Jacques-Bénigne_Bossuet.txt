entirely sever connections cathedral metz though continued hold benefice 1664 widower father ordained priest became canon cathedral metz bossuet named dean cathedral
bossuet quickly gained reputation great preacher 1660 preaching regularly before court chapel royal
1662 preached famous sermon duties kings louis louvre
paris congregations no mercy purely clerical logic clerical taste preacher wished catch their ear manage address them terms agree consider sensible well bred
having very stern ideas dignity priest bossuet refused descend usual devices arousing popular interest
narrative element sermons grew shorter each year
never drew satirical pictures like great rival louis bourdaloue
write out discourses full much less learn them off heart two hundred printed works fraction rough drafts
ladies such mme de sévigné forsook bourdaloue dawned paris horizon 1669 though fénelon bruyère two much sounder critics refused follow their example
bossuet possessed full equipment orator voice language flexibility strength
never needed strain effect genius struck out single blow thought feeling word
martin luther applies peculiarly himself fling fury theses thus unite dry light argument fire heat passion
these qualities reached their highest point oraisons funèbres funeral orations
bossuet best work large canvas besides here no conscientious scruples intervened prevent giving much time thought artistic side subject
oraison name betokened stood midway sermon proper nowadays called biographical sketch
least bossuet made field stood merely first alone

grand dauphin 1661-1711 surviving legitimate son louis 1638-1715
bossuet served tutor 1670-81
18 september 1670 appointed tutor nine-year-old dauphin oldest child louis
choice scarcely fortunate
bossuet unbent far genius no means fitted enter feelings child dauphin cross ungainly sullen lad
probably no happier tutor charge turned sixteen married off bavarian princess
still nine years court no means wasted
bossuet's tutorial functions involved composing necessary books instruction including just handwriting samples also manuals philosophy history religion fit future king france
among books written bossuet during period three classics
first came traité de connaissance de dieu et de soi-même treatise knowledge god one's self 1677 then discours sur l'histoire universelle speech universal history 1679 published 1682 lastly politique tirée de l'écriture sainte politics drawn holy scripture 1679 published 1709
three books fit each other
traité general sketch nature god nature man
discours history god's dealings humanity past
politique code rights duties drawn up light thrown those dealings
bossuet's conclusions drawn holy scripture because wished gain highest possible sanction institutions country hallow france louis proving astonishing likeness israel solomon
then too veil holy scripture enabled speak out boldly court etiquette otherwise allowed remind son louis kings duties well rights
grand dauphin often forgotten these duties son petit dauphin bear them mind
tutor's imagination looked forward time france blossom utopia christian philosopher throne
made stalwart champion authority forms le roi jesus-christ et l'eglise dieu en ces trois noms king jesus christ church god three names says characteristic letter
object books provide authority rational basis
bossuet's worship authority no means killed confidence reason make doubt honesty those reasoned otherwise himself
whole chain argument seemed clear simple
philosophy proves god exists shapes governs course human affairs
history shows governance most part indirect exercised through certain venerable corporations well civil ecclesiastical demand implicit obedience immediate representatives god
thus revolt whether civil religious direct defiance almighty
oliver cromwell becomes moral monster revocation edict nantes greatest achievement second constantine
france youth known misery divided counsels civil war france manhood brought together under absolute sovereign suddenly shot up splendour comparable ancient rome
why then strain every nerve hold innovation bay prolong splendour time? bossuet's own discours sur l'histoire universelle might furnished answer there fall many empires detailed then discours composed under single preoccupation
bossuet establishment christianity point real importance whole history world
totally ignores history islam asia greece rome touched insofar formed part praeparatio evangelica
yet discours far theological pamphlet
while pascal might refer rise fall empires providence chance little grain sand english lord protectors' veins bossuet held fast principle god works through secondary causes
will every great change should roots ages went before
bossuet accordingly made heroic attempt grapple origins causes way book deserves place very first philosophic histories
bishop meaux 1681-1704 bishop bossuet period dauphin's formal education ending 1681 bossuet gazetted bishop meaux before take possession see drawn violent quarrel louis pope innocent xi
here found himself two fires
support pope meant supporting jesuits hated their supposed casuistry dévotion aisée almost much pascal
oppose pope play hands louis frankly anxious humble church before state
bossuet steered middle course
1682 before general assembly french clergy preached great sermon unity church made magnificent plea compromise
louis insisted clergy making anti-papal declaration bossuet got leave draw up made moderate pope declared null void set work gigantic defensio cleri gallicani published after death
throughout controversy unlike court bishops bossuet constantly resided diocese took active interest administration
efforts combat protestantism gallican storm little abated turned back project very near heart
ever since early days metz busy schemes uniting huguenots catholic church
1668 converted turenne 1670 published exposition de foi catholique exposition catholic faith moderate tone adversaries driven accuse having fraudulently watered down catholic dogmas suit protestant taste
finally 1688 great histoire des variations des églises protestantes history variations protestant churches perhaps most brilliant works appeared
few writers made justification controversy interesting even intelligible
argument simple enough
without rules organized society cannot hold together rules require authorized interpreter
protestant churches thrown over interpreter bossuet small trouble showing longer lived varied increasingly important points
moment protestants pulverized before long began ask whether variation necessarily great evil
1691 1701 bossuet corresponded leibniz view reunion negotiations broke down precisely point
leibniz thought countrymen might accept individual roman doctrines flatly refused guarantee necessarily believe tomorrow believe today
prefer church eternally variable ever moving forwards
next protestant writers began accumulate alleged proofs rome's own variations here backed up richard simon priest paris oratory father biblical criticism france
accused st augustine bossuet's own special master having corrupted primitive doctrine grace
bossuet set work defense de tradition simon calmly went raise issues graver still
under veil politely ironic circumlocutions such deceive bishop meaux claimed right interpret bible like any other book
bossuet denounced again again simon friends wait until old fellow no
another oratorian proved dangerous still
simon endangered miracles applying them lay rules evidence malebranche abrogated miracles altogether
blasphemous argued suppose author nature violate law himself established
bossuet might scribble nova mira falsa margins book urge fénelon attack them malebranche politely met threats saying refuted such pen too much honor
these repeated checks soured bossuet's temper
earlier controversies borne himself great magnanimity huguenot ministers refuted found kindly advocate court
approval revocation edict nantes stopped far short approving dragonnades within diocese meaux now patience waning
dissertation father caffaro obscure italian monk became excuse writing certain violent maximes sur comédie 1694 wherein made attack memory molière dead twenty years
controversy fénelon fénelon 1651-1715 bossuet's final rival three years later battling bishop françois fénelon over love god
fénelon 24 years junior old pupil suddenly become rival like bossuet fénelon bishop served royal tutor
controversy concerned their different reactions opinions jeanne guyon her ideas similar quietism molinos condemned pope innocent xi 1687
mme de maintenon began questioning orthodoxy mme guyon's opinions ecclesiastical commission three members including bossuet appointed report matter
commission issued 34 articles known articles d'issy condemned mme guyon's ideas very briefly provided short treatise orthodox catholic conception prayer
fénelon attracted mme guyon's ideas signed off articles mme guyon submitted judgment
bossuet now composed instructions sur les états d'oraison work explained articles d'issy greater depth
fénelon refused endorse treatise however instead composed own explanation meaning articles d'issy explication des maximes des saints
explained view goal human life should love god perfect object neither fear punishment nor desire reward eternal life having anything pure love god
king louis reproached bossuet failing warn grandsons' tutor such unorthodox opinions instructed bossuet other bishops respond maximes des saints
bossuet fénelon thus spent years 1697-9 battling each other pamphlets letters until inquisition finally condemned maximes des saints 12 march 1699
pope innocent xii selected 23 specific passages condemnation
bossuet triumphed controversy fénelon submitted rome's determination matter
bossuet 1702 death until over 70 years bossuet enjoyed good health 1702 developed chronic kidney stones
two years later hopeless invalid 12 april 1704 died quietly
funeral oration given charles de rue sj
