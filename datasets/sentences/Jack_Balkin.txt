memetics ideology transcendence balkin's 1998 book cultural software theory ideology argued ideology explained terms memes processes cultural evolution
argued ideology effect cultural software tools understanding become part human beings produced through evolution transmission memes
same time balkin argued ideological moral analysis presupposes transcendent ideal truth transcendent value justice
like t
seung suggests transcendent idea justice—although incapable perfect realization inevitably indeterminate—underlies political discourse political persuasion
ideological drift legal semiotics balkin coined term ideological drift describe phenomenon ideas concepts change their political valence introduced new social political contexts over time
along duncan kennedy balkin developed field legal semiotics
legal semiotics shows how legal arguments feature recurrent tropes topoi respond each other whose opposition reproduced higher lower levels doctrinal detail legal doctrines evolve
hence balkin claimed legal argument self-similar crystalline fractal structure
balkin employed deconstruction related literary theories argue legal thought structured terms nested oppositions—opposed ideas concepts turn each other over time otherwise depend each other novel unexpected ways
although draws literary theory work legal rhetoric balkin frequent co-author sanford levinson contend law best analogized literature performing arts such music drama
partisan entrenchment balkin levinson argue constitutional revolutions judicial doctrine occur through process called partisan entrenchment
party controls white house stock federal courts new judges justices views key constitutional issues roughly similar those president
shifts median justice supreme court changes complexion lower federal courts turn eventually affects constitutional doctrine
enough new judges appointed relatively short period time changes will occur quickly producing constitutional revolution
example constitutional revolution occurred following new deal because franklin roosevelt able appoint eight new supreme court justices 1937 1941
balkin levinson's theory contrasts bruce ackerman's theory constitutional moments argues constitutional revolutions occur because self-conscious acts democratic mobilization establish new standards political legitimacy
balkin levinson view partisan entrenchment roughly imperfectly democratic guarantees neither legitimate nor correct constitutional interpretation
constitutional interpretation balkin's constitutional theory developed 2011 book living originalism both originalist living constitutionalist
argues there no contradiction these approaches properly understood
interpreters must follow original meaning constitutional text original expected application hence much constitutional interpretation actually involves constitutional construction state building three branches government
balkin's framework originalism views constitution initial framework governance sets politics motion makes politics possible must filled out over time through constitutional construction state building
process building out constitution living constitutionalism
democratic culture balkin's work first amendment argues purpose free speech principle promote calls democratic culture
idea democratic culture broader concern democratic deliberation democratic self-government emphasizes individual freedom cultural participation mutual influence
democratic culture ordinary individuals participate forms culture turn help shape constitute them persons
balkin argues free speech internet characterized two features routing around media gatekeepers glomming on—non-exclusive appropriation cultural content melded other sources create new forms culture
these distinctive features internet speech argues actually features speech general thus lead focus democratic participation culture
national surveillance state 2006 essay levinson 2008 article balkin discusses emergence national surveillance state uses collection collation analysis information govern
national surveillance state natural byproduct technological development demands government services
balkin argues “[t]he question whether will surveillance state years come sort state will
balkin distinguishes two models authoritarian information state democratic information state
authoritarian information states information misers information gluttons collect much information possible resist sharing making their own operations public
democratic information states information gourmets information philanthropists collect need produce information share information their citizens make their own operations democratically accountable
democratic information states also destroy government collected information no longer necessary
practice much privacy protection came fact people forgot happened
digital age nothing ever forgotten appropriate discarding results government surveillance must mandated
surveillance state grows balkin argues new civil liberties protections necessary just necessary growth administrative state after new deal national security state after world war ii
executive branch must redesigned internal checks balances police itself report activities prevent abuse
finally technology must used record officials look signs government misconduct best way control watchers watch them well
