contributions linguistics linguistic typology greenberg's reputation rests part contributions synchronic linguistics quest identify linguistic universals
late 1950 s greenberg began examine corpora languages covering wide geographic genetic distribution
located number interesting potential universals well many strong cross-linguistic tendencies
particular greenberg conceptualized idea implicational universal takes form language structure x then must also structure
example x might mid front rounded vowels high front rounded vowels terminology see phonetics
many scholars took up kind research following greenberg's example remains important synchronic linguistics
like noam chomsky greenberg sought discover universal structures underlying human language
unlike chomsky greenberg’s approach functionalist rather formalist
argument reconcile greenbergian chomskyan approaches found linguistic universals 2006 edited ricardo mairal juana gil
many strongly opposed greenberg's methods language classification see below acknowledge importance typological work
1963 published article extremely influential field universals grammar particular reference order meaningful elements
mass comparison main article mass comparison greenberg rejected view prevalent among linguists since mid-20 th century comparative reconstruction tool discover relationships languages
argued genetic classification methodologically prior comparative reconstruction first stage you cannot engage comparative reconstruction languages until you know languages compare 195744
also criticized prevalent view comprehensive comparisons two languages time commonly take years carry out establish language families any size
argued even languages there already 4140 ways classify them distinct families while 25 languages there 4749027089305918018 ways 195744
way comparison niger–congo family 1500 languages
thought language families any size needed established scholastic means other bilateral comparison
theory mass comparison attempt demonstrate those means
greenberg argued virtues breadth over depth
advocated restricting amount material compared basic vocabulary morphology known paths sound change increasing number languages compared languages given area
make possible compare numerous languages reliably
same time process provide check accidental resemblances through sheer number languages under review
mathematical probability resemblances accidental decreases sharply number languages concerned 195739
greenberg claimed mass borrowing basic vocabulary unknown
argued borrowing occurs concentrated cultural vocabulary clusters certain semantic areas making easy detect 195739
goal determining broad patterns relationship issue get every word right detect patterns
beginning theory mass comparison greenberg addressed why issues chance resemblance borrowing obstacles being useful
despite critics consider those areas shortcomings theory
greenberg first called method mass comparison article 1954 reprinted greenberg 1955
1987 replaced term mass comparison multilateral comparison emphasize contrast bilateral comparisons recommended linguistics textbooks
believed multilateral comparison any way opposed comparative method contrary necessary first step greenberg 195744
according comparative reconstruction should status explanatory theory facts already established language classification greenberg 195745
most historical linguists campbell 200145 reject use mass comparison tool establishing genealogical relationships languages

genetic classification languages languages africa main article languages africa greenberg widely known development classification system languages africa published series articles southwestern journal anthropology 1949 1954 reprinted together book 1955
revised book published again 1963 followed nearly identical edition 1966 reprinted without change 1970
few further changes classification made greenberg article 1981
greenberg grouped hundreds african languages four families dubbed afroasiatic nilo-saharan niger–congo khoisan
course work greenberg coined term afroasiatic replace earlier term hamito-semitic after showing racially based hamitic widely accepted since 19 th century valid language family
another major feature work support classification bantu languages occupy much sub-saharan africa branch niger–congo language family rather independent family many bantuists maintained
greenberg's classification rested largely evaluating competing earlier classifications
time classification considered bold speculative especially proposal nilo-saharan languages family
now apart khoisan generally accepted african specialists used basis further work other scholars
greenberg's work african languages criticised lyle campbell donald ringe believe classification justified data request reexamination macro-phyla reliable methods ringe 1993104
harold fleming lionel bender sympathetic greenberg's classification acknowledge least macrofamilies particularly nilo-saharan khoisan fully accepted linguistic community may need split up campbell 1997
their objection methodological mass comparison valid method cannot expected successfully brought order out chaos african languages
contrast linguists sought combine greenberg's four african families larger units
particular edgar gregersen 1972 proposed joining niger–congo nilo-saharan larger family termed kongo-saharan
roger blench 1995 suggests niger–congo subfamily nilo-saharan
languages new guinea tasmania andaman islands main article indo-pacific languages 1971 greenberg proposed indo-pacific macrofamily groups together papuan languages large number language families new guinea nearby islands native languages andaman islands tasmania excludes australian aboriginal languages
principal feature reduce manifold language families new guinea single genetic unit
excludes austronesian languages established associated recent migration peoples
greenberg's subgrouping these languages accepted few specialists worked classification these languages
however work stephen wurm 1982 malcolm ross 2005 provided considerable support once-radical idea these languages form single genetic unit
wurm stated lexical similarities great andamanese west papuan timor–alor families quite striking amount virtual formal identity [

languages americas main article amerind languages most american indian linguists classify native languages americas 150 180 independent language families
thought two language families eskimo–aleut na-dené distinct perhaps results later migrations new world
early greenberg 195741 1960 became convinced many language groups considered unrelated classified larger groupings
1987 book language americas while supporting eskimo–aleut na-dené groupings distinct proposed other native american languages belong single language macro-family termed amerind
language americas generated lively debate strongly criticized rejected most specialists indigenous languages americas also most historical linguists
specialists individual language families found extensive inaccuracies errors greenberg’s data such including data non-existent languages erroneous transcriptions forms compared misinterpretations meanings words used comparison entirely spurious forms
historical linguists also reject validity method multilateral mass comparison upon classification based
argue provided convincing case similarities presented evidence due inheritance earlier common ancestor rather being explained combination accidental similarity errors excessive semantic latitude comparisons borrowings onomatopoeia etc
languages northern eurasia main article eurasiatic languages later life greenberg proposed nearly language families northern eurasia belong single higher-order family called eurasiatic
exception yeniseian related wider dené–caucasian grouping also including sino-tibetan
2008 edward vajda related yeniseian na-dené languages north america dené–yeniseian family
eurasiatic grouping resembles older nostratic groupings holger pedersen vladislav illich-svitych including indo-european uralic altaic
differs including nivkh japonic korean ainu nostraticists excluded comparison because single languages rather language families excluding afroasiatic
time russian nostraticists notably sergei starostin constructed revised version nostratic
slightly broader greenberg's grouping also left out afroasiatic
recently consensus emerging among proponents nostratic hypothesis
greenberg basically agreed nostratic concept though stressed deep internal division northern 'tier' eurasiatic southern 'tier' principally afroasiatic dravidian
american nostraticist allan bomhard considers eurasiatic branch nostratic alongside other branches afroasiatic elamo-dravidian kartvelian
similarly georgiy starostin 2002 arrives tripartite overall grouping considers afroasiatic nostratic elamite roughly equidistant closely related each other anything else
sergei starostin's school now included afroasiatic broadly defined nostratic
reserve term eurasiatic designate narrower subgrouping comprises rest macrofamily
recent proposals thus differ mainly precise placement dravidian kartvelian
greenberg continued work project after diagnosed incurable pancreatic cancer until died may 2001
colleague former student merritt ruhlen ensured publication final volume eurasiatic work 2002 after death
