jurisprudence philosophy law rule principle dworkin critic hla hart's legal positivism summarized stanford encyclopedia stated dworkin positivism's most significant critic rejects positivist theory every conceivable level
dworkin denies there any general theory existence content law denies local theories particular legal systems identify law without recourse moral merits rejects whole institutional focus positivism
theory law dworkin theory how cases ought decided begins account political organization legal system abstract ideal regulating conditions under governments may use coercive force over their subjects
ronald dworkin 2008 dworkin most famous critique hart's legal positivism sets forth fullest statement critique book law's empire
dworkin's theory 'interpretive' law whatever follows constructive interpretation institutional history legal system
dworkin argues moral principles people hold dear often wrong even extent certain crimes acceptable one's principles skewed enough
discover apply these principles courts interpret legal data legislation cases etc
view articulating interpretation best explains justifies past legal practice
interpretation must follow dworkin argues notion law integrity make sense
out idea law 'interpretive' way dworkin argues every situation people's legal rights controversial best interpretation involves right answer thesis thesis there exists right answer matter law judge must discover
dworkin opposes notion judges discretion such difficult cases
dworkin's model legal principles also connected hart's notion rule recognition
dworkin rejects hart's conception master rule every legal system identifies valid laws basis entail process identifying law must uncontroversial whereas dworkin argues people legal rights even cases correct legal outcome open reasonable dispute
dworkin moves away positivism's separation law morality since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments every decision law
right answer thesis dworkin's own words right answer thesis may interpreted through following words suppose legislature passed statute stipulating sacrilegious contracts shall henceforth invalid
community divided whether contract signed sunday reason alone sacrilegious
known very few legislators question mind voted now equally divided question whether should interpreted
tom tim signed contract sunday tom now sues tim enforce terms contract whose validity tim contests
shall say judge must look right answer question whether tom's contract valid even though community deeply divided right answer is? realistic say there simply no right answer question? dworkin's most interesting controversial theses states law properly interpreted will give answer
say everyone will same answer consensus right answer justified exactly same way every person rather means there will necessary answer each individual applies himself correctly legal question
correct method encapsulated metaphor judge hercules ideal judge immensely wise full knowledge legal sources
hercules name comes classical mythological hero also plenty time decide
acting premise law seamless web hercules required construct theory best fits justifies law whole law integrity order decide any particular case
hercules dworkin argues come right answer
dworkin does deny competent lawyers often disagree solution given case
contrary claims disagreeing right answer case answer hercules give
dworkin's critics argue law proper legal sources positivist sense full gaps inconsistencies also other legal standards including principles may insufficient solve hard case
them incommensurable
any these situations even hercules dilemma none possible answers right
discussion right answer thesis dworkin's metaphor judge hercules bears resemblance rawls' veil ignorance habermas' ideal speech situation suggest idealized methods arriving somehow valid normative propositions
key difference respect former rawls' veil ignorance translates almost seamlessly purely ideal practical
relation politics democratic society example way saying those power should treat political opposition consistently how like treated opposition because their present position offers no guarantee their position will political landscape future
will inevitably form opposition point
dworkin's judge hercules other hand purely idealized construct such figure existed arrive right answer every moral dilemma
critique along these lines see lorenzo zucca's constitutional dilemmas
dworkin's right answer thesis turns success attack skeptical argument right answers legal-moral dilemmas cannot determined
dworkin's anti-skeptical argument essentially properties skeptic's claim analogous those substantive moral claims asserting truth falsity legal-moral dilemmas cannot determined skeptic makes metaphysical claim way things moral claim effect face epistemic uncertainty unjust determine legal-moral issues detriment any given individual
moral reading constitution her recent book hans kelsen sandrine baume identified ronald dworkin leading defender compatibility judicial review very principles democracy
baume identified john hart ely alongside dworkin foremost defenders principle recent years while opposition principle compatibility identified bruce ackerman jeremy waldron
dworkin long-time advocate principle moral reading constitution whose lines support sees strongly associated enhanced versions judicial review federal government
theory equality dworkin also made important contributions sometimes called equality debate
famous pair articles book sovereign virtue advocates theory calls 'equality resources'
theory combines two key ideas
broadly speaking first human beings responsible life choices make
second natural endowments intelligence talent morally arbitrary ought affect distribution resources society
like rest dworkin's work theory equality underpinned core principle every person entitled equal concern respect design structure society
dworkin's theory equality variety so-called luck egalitarianism rejects statement philosophy public affairs v

positive negative liberty essay values conflict? hedgehog's approach arizona law review vol 432 dworkin contends values liberty equality necessarily conflict
criticizes isaiah berlin's conception liberty flat proposes new dynamic conception liberty suggesting cannot say one's liberty infringed prevented committing murder
thus liberty cannot infringed no wrong done
put way liberty liberty whatever wish long infringe upon rights others
