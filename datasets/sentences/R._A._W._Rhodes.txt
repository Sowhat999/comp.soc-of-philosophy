research rhodes influential developing several ideas present day political science
differentiated polity idea british government should seen fragmented differentiated polity rather unitary state hugely influential widely debated
idea ‘may becoming new orthodoxy’
core executive patrick dunleavy rhodes argued conventional debate british executive focus relative power prime minister cabinet too limited
core functions british executive pull together integrate central government policies act final arbiters conflicts different elements government machine
these functions carried out institutions other prime minister cabinet example treasury cabinet office
defining core executive functional terms key questions become ‘who does what?’ ‘who resources?’
policy networks rhodes pioneered analysis policy networks british government
term refers sets formal informal institutional linkages governmental other actors structured around shared interests public policymaking implementation
these institutions interdependent
policies emerge bargaining networks’ members
other actors commonly include professions trade unions big business
central departments need their co-operation because british government rarely delivers services itself
uses other bodies
also there too many groups consult government must aggregate interests
needs ‘legitimated’ spokespeople policy area
groups need money legislative authority government provide
governance term refers new process governing changed condition ordered rule new method society governed
rhodes applied idea public administration public policy refer changing boundaries public private voluntary sectors
many policy arenas these sectors interdependent decisions product their game-like interactions rooted trust regulated rules game negotiated agreed participants
such networks significant degree autonomy state - self-organising - although state indirectly imperfectly steer them
sum governance refers governing through networks network steering
arguments there shift ‘government governance’ mix bureaucracy markets networks mattered consequent ‘hollowing out state’ now referred debated ‘the anglo-governance school’

interpretive political science mark bevir r
rhodes authors interpreting british governance 2003 governance stories 2006
argue political science must necessarily interpretive art
because hold starting point enquiry must unpack meanings beliefs preferences actors order then make sense understanding actions practices institutions
political science therefore interpretative discipline underpinned hermeneutic philosophy rather positivism there no ‘science’ politics instead explanations including those deploy statistics models best conceived narratives
bevir rhodes thus provide elaborate philosophical foundation decentred theory governance woven together notions beliefs traditions dilemmas
'it follows role political scientists use ethnography uncover people’s beliefs preferences 2 history uncover traditions develop response dilemmas
product story other people’s constructions doing provides actors’ views changes government economy society
example political scientist may select part governance process then explain unpicking various political traditions how actors within these traditions encounter act resolve dilemmas
governance thus understood contingent unintended outcome competing narratives governance
’ decentred theory governance bevir rhodes decentered theory revolves around idea situated agency institutions practices socialisation cannot determine how people behave any course action contingent individual choice
people’s actions explained their beliefs meanings desires any belief interpreted context wider web person’s beliefs these beliefs explained traditions modified dilemmas
tradition episteme paradigm set theories against background person comes hold beliefs perform actions
first influence upon people set beliefs inherit then transform response encounters dilemmas problems anomalies
dilemma arises whenever novel circumstances generate new belief forces people question their previously held beliefs
change occurs through encountering such dilemmas while individual responses dilemmas grounded traditions then modify just those traditions
administrative ethnography latterly rhodes argued too few political scientists engaged observation founded manchester university press series ‘political administrative ethnography’ encourage fieldwork political science
