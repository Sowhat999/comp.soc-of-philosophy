these media contributed obsession present-mindedness wiping out concerns past future
innis overwhelming pressure mechanization evident newspaper magazine led creation vast monopolies communication
their entrenched positions involve continuous systematic ruthless destruction elements permanence essential cultural activity
western civilization saved innis argued recovering balance space time
meant reinvigorating oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions higher learning political commercial pressures
essay plea time suggested genuine dialogue within universities produce critical thinking necessary restore balance power knowledge
then universities muster courage attack monopolies imperil civilization
although innis remains appreciated respected grand unique nature later efforts regarding communications theories without critics

young english professor mc luhan flattered learned innis put book mechanical bride reading list fourth-year economics course
mc luhan built innis's idea studying effects communications media technological form mattered content
biographer paul heyer writes innis's concept bias particular medium communication seen less flamboyant precursor mc luhan's legendary phrase 'the medium message
innis example tried show how printed media such books newspapers biased toward control over space secular power while engraved media such stone clay tablets biased favour continuity time metaphysical religious knowledge
mc luhan focused may called medium's sensory bias arguing example books newspapers appealed rationality eye while radio played irrationality ear
differences innisian mc luhanesque approaches summarized late james w
carey both mc luhan innis assume centrality communication technology differ principal kinds effects see deriving technology
whereas innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization culture mc luhan sees principal effect sensory organization thought
mc luhan much say perception thought little say institutions innis says much institutions little perception thought
biographer john watson notes innis's work profoundly political while mc luhan's
writes mechanization knowledge relative sensual bias media key innis's work
also underlies politicization innis's position vis-a-vis mc luhan
watson adds innis believed very different media produce similar effects
innis yellow press united states nazi loudspeaker same form negative effect reduced men thinking beings mere automatons chain command
watson argues while mc luhan separated media according their sensory bias innis examined different set interrelationships dialectic power knowledge specific historical circumstances
watson innis's work therefore flexible less deterministic mc luhan's
scholars teachers innis mc luhan shared similar dilemma since both argued book culture tended produce fixed points view homogeneity thought yet both produced many books
introduction 1964 reprint bias communication mc luhan marvelled innis's technique juxtaposing insights mosaic structure seemingly unrelated disproportioned sentences aphorisms
mc luhan argued although made reading innis's dense prose difficult—a pattern insights packaged consumer palate—innis's method approximated natural form conversation dialogue rather written discourse
best yielded insight pattern recognition rather classified knowledge overvalued print-trained scholars
how exciting encounter writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation exploration mc luhan added
mc luhan's own books their reliance aphorisms puns quips probes oddly juxtaposed observations also employ mosaic technique
innis's theories political economy media society remain highly relevant profound influence critical media theory communications conjunction mc luhan offered groundbreaking canadian perspectives function communication technologies key agents social historical change
together their works advanced theory history communication central social change transformation
