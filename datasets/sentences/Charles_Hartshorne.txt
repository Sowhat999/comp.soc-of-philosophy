philosophy theology intellectual movement hartshorne associated generally referred process theology
roots process thinking found greek philosopher heraclitus
contemporary process philosophy arose work alfred north whitehead while hartshorne identified seminal influence process theology emerged after world war two
key motifs process philosophy empiricism relationalism process events
motif empiricism process thought refers theme experience realm defining meaning verifying any theory reality
unlike classical empiricism process thought takes category thinking beyond just human senses perception
experiences confined sense perception consciousness there pre-sensual pre-conscious experiences consciousness perception derive
motif relationalism refers both experiences relationships
humans experience things also experience relationship things
motif process means time history change dynamic evolutionary process
final motif events refers units organic inorganic world
while hartshorne acknowledges importance whitehead's philosophy own ideas entirely agree whitehead
hartshorne's process theology god world exist dynamic changing relationship
god 'di-polar' deity
hartshorne meant god both abstract concrete poles
abstract pole refers those elements within god never vary such god's self-identity while concrete pole refers organic growth god's perfect knowledge world world itself develops changes
hartshorne accept classical theistic claim creatio ex nihilo creation out nothing instead held creatio ex materia creation out pre-existent material
technical terms hartshorne used pan-en-theism originally coined karl christian friedrich krause 1828
panentheism god must differentiated classical pantheism god
hartshorne's theology god identical world god also completely independent world
god self-identity transcends earth world also contained within god
rough analogy relationship mother fetus
mother her own identity different unborn yet intimately connected unborn
unborn within womb attached mother via umbilical cord
hartshorne reworked ontological argument god's existence promulgated anselm
anselm's equation god no greater conceived
anselm's argument used concept perfection
hartshorne accepts definition god perfect
however hartshorne maintains classical christian theism held self-contradictory notion perfection
argues classical concept god fails
hartshorne posited god's existence necessary compatible any events world
economy argument hartshorne attempted break perceived stalemate theology over problem evil god's omnipotence
hartshorne perfection means god cannot surpassed social relatedness every creature
god capable surpassing himself growing changing knowledge feeling world
hartshorne acknowledged god capable change consistent pandeism early specifically rejected both deism pandeism favor panentheism writing panentheistic doctrine contains deism pandeism except their arbitrary negations
hartshorne believe immortality human souls identities separate god explained beauty created person's life will exist ever reality god
understood way reminiscent hinduism perhaps buddhism's sunyata emptiness ontology[dubious discuss] namely person's identity extinguished one's ultimate union god person's life within god eternal
hartshorne regularly attended services several unitarian universalist churches joined first unitarian universalist church austin texas
criticisms hartshorne's philosophical theological views received criticism many different quarters
positive criticism underscored hartshorne's emphasis change process creativity acted great corrective static thinking causal laws determinism
several commentators affirm position offers metaphysical coherence providing coherent set concepts
others indicate hartshorne quite properly placed valuable emphasis appreciating nature even evidenced hartshorne's hobby bird-watching
emphasis nature human-divine relationships world goaded reflective work developing theologies pollution resource degradation philosophy ecology
allied hartshorne's emphasis aesthetics beauty
system thought science theology achieve integration science theology provide data each other
hartshorne also important figure upholding natural theology offering understanding god personal dynamic being
accepted many philosophers hartshorne made idea perfection rationally conceivable contribution ontological argument deemed valuable modern philosophical discussion
hartshorne placed interesting emphasis affirming god loves creation also endures suffering
theological thought centrality love very strong particularly interpretation god nature living creatures
hartshorne also appreciated philosophical interest buddhism stimulating others new approaches inter-religious co-operation dialogue
langdon gilkey questioned hartshorne's assumptions human reasoning experiences
gilkey pointed out hartshorne assumes there objective rational structure whole universe then assumes human thought acquire accurate adequate knowledge universe
hartshorne's theology there no literal first event universe universe thus regarded actually infinite reality
led point out hartshorne emphasized every event partly determined previous events thought susceptible fallacy infinite regress
other critics question adequacy panentheism
point tension hartshorne's theology whether god really worthy worship since god needs world order complete being
traditional theism posits god complete being before creation world
others find argument god's perfection flawed confusing existential necessity logical necessity
classical protestant evangelical thought hartshorne's theology received strong criticism
these theological networks hartshorne's panentheist reinterpretation god's nature deemed incompatible biblical revelation classic creedal formulations trinity
critics such royce gruenler ronald nash norman geisler argue hartshorne does offer tripersonal view trinity instead interpretation christ christology affinities early heresy ebionites
also argued hartshorne's theology entails denial divine foreknowledge predestination salvation
hartshorne also criticized denial devaluing christ's miracles supernatural events mentioned bible
other criticisms hartshorne gives little attention classical theological concepts god's holiness awe god undeveloped element writings
alan gragg criticizes hartshorne's highly optimistic view humanity hence lack emphasis human depravity guilt sin
allied these criticisms assertion hartshorne over-emphasizes aesthetics correspondingly weak ethics morality
others indicated hartshorne failed understand traditional christian views petitionary prayer survival individual afterlife
