unity liberty socialism “ liberty wider greater binding oneself renaissance one's nation revolution? liberty seek opposed legislative measures curb exploitations feudalists capitalists opportunists
new strict liberty stands against pressure confusion
dictatorship precarious unsuitable self-contradictory system does allow consciousness people grow
— aflaq speech talking key ba'athist tenets freedom will come arabs through unity [the establishment arab nation] arab socialist ba'ath party slogan unity liberty socialism key tenet aflaq's ba'athist thought
unity meant unification arab people nation arab nation
creation arab nation direct implications arab development
establishment new state lead arab ba'ath literally meaning renaissance
arab nations time progressively decline unified these nations various ailments feudalism sectarianism regionalism intellectual reactionism
way cure arab nations according aflaq through revolutionary movement
aflaq influenced marxism saw need vanguard party rule arab nation indefinite period time period transition old new
need liberty defining features ba'athism however liberty sense used liberal democracies
aflaq strong believer pluralism thought paradoxically against pluralism form votes
theory ba'ath party rule guide people transitional period time without consulting people because party knew right
last tenet 'socialism' mean socialism defined west rather unique form arab socialism
aflaq coined word arab socialism variant socialism
socialism original form arab world according aflaq first come being under rule muhammad
point arab socialism answer questions such how much state control necessary economic equality instead arab socialism system freed arab people oppression enslavement turn created independent individuals
aflaq opposed marx's view dialectical materialism truth believed importance material economic conditions life greatest discoveries modern history
even aflaq critical both capitalism communism want either two power blocs collapse during cold war believing cold war sort check balance their power
role islam aflaq saw islam revolutionary movement
contrast other nationalities arab awakening expansion attributed religious message
because aflaq believed arab's spirituality directly linked islam therefore never take islam out equation essentially essentially arab
arab nationalism just islam during lifetime muhammad spiritual revolutionary movement leading arabs towards new renaissance arab nationalism second revolution appear arab world
arab religious communities should according aflaq respect worship spirituality islam even worship islam religious sense aflaq christian worshipped islam
aflaq believe necessary worship muhammad believed arabs should strive emulate muhammad
words aflaq himself arabs belong nation gave birth muhammad rather because arab individual member community muhammad put efforts creating […] muhammad arabs let us today make arabs muhammad
muslim muhammad's days according aflaq synonymous arabs arabs ones preach message islam during muhammad's lifetime
contrast jesus religious leader political leader muhammad both first leader islam arab world
therefore secularisation take same shape arab world west
aflaq called arabs both muslim non-muslim alike admire role islam played creating arab character
view islam purely spiritual aflaq emphasised islam should imposed state society
time again aflaq emphasised ba'ath party against atheism also equally against fundamentalism
any fundamentalism represented shallow false faith
according ba'athist ideology religions equal
despite anti-atheist stance aflaq strong supporter secular government stated ba'athist state replace religion state based foundation arab nationalism moral freedom
legacy theoretical contributions met mixed reactions fouad ajami criticised aflaq lack real substance stating nearly three hundred pages text yield no insight part went wrong needed done there visible infatuation words aflaq summons party renounce power go back 'pure essence'
there truth critique
aflaq spent much time energy writing optimistically future past arab nation how arab world unified
kanan makiya author republic fear politics modern iraq notes aflaq reality confined inner world party
contrast other philosophers such karl marx john locke aflaq's ideological view world makes no clear stand materialistic socioeconomic behavior humanity
while other philosophers make distinctions real real prescriptive descriptive analysis aflaq rule define ought
thought both molded same category attainable
contrast longtime friend colleague salah al-din al-bitar practical came politics aflaq visionary dreamer rather unfitted political life
aflaq described associates ascetic shy intense figure living simple unpretensious life
accused seeking help other people instead fulfilling goal himself others led aflaq collaborated gamal abdel nasser abd al-karim qasim abdul rahman arif 1958 ahmed hassan al-bakr ali salih al-sadi 1963 finally 1970 s saddam hussein
there several ba'athists mostly syrian-led ba'ath party believe aflaq stole ba'athist ideology original founder zaki al-arsuzi
these individuals denounced labelled aflaq thief
writings aflaq stridently favor free speech other human rights aid lower classes
during military committee's gradual take over power syria aflaq rallied against saw establishment military dictatorship instead democracy aflaq planned
these ideals never realized governments used ideology
most scholars see assad government syria saddam hussein's government iraq employed aflaq's ideology pretense dictatorship
