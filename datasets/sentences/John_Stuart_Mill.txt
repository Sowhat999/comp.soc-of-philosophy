works theory liberty main article liberty mill's liberty addresses nature limits power legitimately exercised society over individual
however mill clear concern liberty does extend individuals societies
states despotism legitimate mode government dealing barbarians
mill states acceptable harm oneself long person doing harming others
also argues individuals should prevented doing lasting serious harm themselves their property harm principle
because no exists isolation harm done oneself may also harm others destroying property deprives community well oneself
mill excuses those incapable self-government principle such young children those living backward states society
though principle seems clear there number complications
example mill explicitly states harms may include acts omission well acts commission
thus failing rescue drowning child counts harmful act does failing pay taxes failing appear witness court
such harmful omissions may regulated according mill
contrast does count harming someone without force fraud affected individual consents assume risk thus may permissibly offer unsafe employment others provided there no deception involved
mill does however recognise limit consent society should permit people sell themselves slavery
these other cases important bear mind arguments liberty grounded principle utility appeals natural rights
question counts self-regarding action actions whether omission commission constitute harmful actions subject regulation continues exercise interpreters mill
important emphasise mill consider giving offence constitute harm action restricted because violated conventions morals given society
liberty involves impassioned defense free speech
mill argues free discourse necessary condition intellectual social progress
never sure contends silenced opinion does contain element truth
also argues allowing people air false opinions productive two reasons
first individuals likely abandon erroneous beliefs engaged open exchange ideas
second forcing other individuals re-examine re-affirm their beliefs process debate these beliefs kept declining mere dogma
enough mill simply unexamined belief happens true must understand why belief question true
along those same lines mill unmeasured vituperation employed side prevailing opinion really does deter people expressing contrary opinions listening those express them

mill added despotism legitimate mode government dealing barbarians provided end their improvement means justified actually effecting end
liberty principle no application any state things anterior time mankind become capable being improved free equal discussion

denounce reprobate pretension less put forth side my most solemn convictions
however positive anyone's persuasion may faculty pernicious consequences adopt expressions altogether condemn immorality impiety opinion
yet pursuance private judgement though backed public judgement country contemporaries prevents opinion being heard defence assumes infallibility
far assumption being less objectionable less dangerous because opinion called immoral impious case others most fatal
mill outlines benefits 'searching discovering truth' way further knowledge
argued even opinion false truth better understood refuting error
most opinions neither completely true nor completely false points out allowing free expression allows airing competing views way preserve partial truth various opinions

philosophy long tradition although mill's account primarily influenced jeremy bentham mill's father james mill
jeremy bentham's famous formulation utilitarianism known greatest-happiness principle
holds must act produce greatest aggregate happiness among sentient beings within reason
mill's major contribution utilitarianism argument qualitative separation pleasures
bentham treats forms happiness equal whereas mill argues intellectual moral pleasures higher pleasures superior physical forms pleasure lower pleasures
mill distinguishes happiness contentment claiming former higher value latter belief wittily encapsulated statement better human being dissatisfied pig satisfied better socrates dissatisfied fool satisfied
fool pig different opinion because know their own side question
mill defines difference higher lower forms pleasure principle those experienced both tend prefer over other
perhaps direct contrast bentham's statement quantity pleasure being equal push-pin good poetry simple child's game like hopscotch causes pleasure people night opera house imperative upon society devote resources propagating hopscotch running opera houses
mill's argument simple pleasures tend preferred people no experience high art therefore proper position judge
mill also argues people example noble practice philosophy benefit society those engage individualist practices pleasure lower forms happiness
agent's own greatest happiness matters greatest amount happiness altogether
qualitative account happiness mill advocates thus sheds light account presented liberty
mill suggests text utility conceived relation humanity progressive being includes development exercise rational capacities strive achieve higher mode existence
rejection censorship paternalism intended provide necessary social conditions achievement knowledge greatest ability greatest number develop exercise their deliberative rational capacities
economic philosophy main article principles political economy essays economics society 1967 mill's early economic philosophy free markets
however accepted interventions economy such tax alcohol there sufficient utilitarian grounds
also accepted principle legislative intervention purpose animal welfare
mill originally believed equality taxation meant equality sacrifice progressive taxation penalised those worked harder saved therefore mild form robbery
given equal tax rate regardless income mill agreed inheritance should taxed
utilitarian society agree everyone should equal way another
therefore receiving inheritance put ahead society unless taxed inheritance
those donate should consider choose carefully their money goes—some charities deserving others
considering public charities boards such government will disburse money equally
however private charity board like church disburse monies fairly those need others
later altered views toward socialist bent adding chapters principles political economy defence socialist outlook defending socialist causes

wages generally exceed minimum subsistence level paid out capital
hence wages limited existing capital paying wages
thus wage per worker derived dividing total circulating capital size working population
wages increase increase capital used paying wages decrease number workers
wages rise supply labour will rise
competition among workers brings down wages also keeps workers out employment
based mill's notion demand commodities demand labourers
means income invested advances wages labour creates employment income spent consumer goods
increase consumption causes decline investment
increased investment leads increases wage fund economic progress
1869 mill recanted support wage-fund doctrine due recognition capital necessarily fixed supplemented through “income employer might otherwise go savings spent consumption
spiegel[who?] p
390 walker[who?] also states “the wages question” limits capital growth population “were accidental essential” formation doctrine
