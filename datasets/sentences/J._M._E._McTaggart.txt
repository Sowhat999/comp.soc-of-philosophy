1899 married margaret elizabeth bird new zealand whom met while visiting mother then living near new plymouth taranaki survived her couple no children
hegel scholarship mc taggart's earlier work devoted exposition critique hegel's metaphysical methods conclusions their application other fields
first published work studies hegelian dialectic 1896 expanded version trinity fellowship dissertation focused dialectical method hegel's logic
second work studies hegelian cosmology 1901 directed towards critique applications hegelian ideas made both hegel earlier neo-hegelians fields ethics politics religion
book number distinctive doctrines already appear example belief human immortality
final book specifically hegel commentary hegel's logic 1910 attempted explain extent defend argument logic
although defended dialectical method broadly construed shared similar outlook hegel mc taggart's hegelianism uncritical disagreed significantly both hegel himself earlier neo-hegelians
believed many specific features hegel's argument gravely flawed similarly disparaging hegel's application abstract thought
however no means reached same conclusions previous generations british idealists later work came hold strikingly different original views
nonetheless spite break earlier forms hegelianism mc taggart inherited predecessors pivotal belief ability priori thought grasp nature ultimate reality like earlier hegelians absolute idea
indeed later work mature system seen largely attempt give substance new conception absolute
unreality time 1908 unreality time 1908 work best known today mc taggart argued our perception time illusion time itself merely ideal
introduced notions series series interpretations time representing two different ways events time arranged
series corresponds our everyday notions past present future
series series positions running far past through near past present then present near future far future p
contrasted series positions ordered earlier-than later-than relations
thus series represent events time moving relation future present past temporally moving observer whereas series orders time events firm fixed relations other time events
mc taggart argued series necessary component any full theory time since change occurs series also self-contradictory our perception time therefore ultimately incoherent illusion
necessity series first longer part mc taggart's argument affirmative answer question whether essential reality time events should form series well series p
broadly mc taggart argues events ordered well series then there cannot change
centre argument example death queen anne
event death certain causes certain effects later death queen elizabeth etc
none these properties change over time
respect does event change began being future event
became every moment event nearer future
last present event
then became past will remain though every moment becomes further further past
thus seem forced conclusion change change characteristics imparted events their presence series p
despite power originality half mc taggart's argument historically received less attention second half
incoherence series most often presented mc taggart's attempted proof incoherence series argument pages 468–9 appears original paper single part broader argument conclusion extended general application
according argument contradiction our perception time events exemplify three properties a-series viz
being past present future
obvious response while exemplifying three properties time no event exemplifies three once no event past present future
single event present will future will past here there seems no contradiction
mc taggart's great insight assent will apparently give rise vicious circle infinite regress
hand response depends upon a-series make sense
distinguish properties being present having future going past requires conception time divided past present future hence a-series
accordingly series pre-supposed order account series
clearly vicious circle p
same difficulty represented 'vicious infinite series' infinite regress
construe response above constructing second series within first falls same way events fall within first p
even idea second series within first falls makes sense mc taggart doubts does p
469 will face same contradiction
must construct third series within second falls
will require construction fourth series ad infinitum
any given stage contradiction will appear however far go constructing series each series will without reference further series containing contradictory
ought conclude therefore series indeed contradictory therefore does exist
mature system nature existence later work particularly two-volume nature existence mc taggart developed own highly original metaphysical system
most famous element defence unreality time mc taggart's system much broader
nature existence mc taggart defended similar hegelian view universe earlier work basis hegel's dialectics rather mode modern metaphysics
mc taggart concluded world composed nothing souls each soul related others love
while argued against belief personal god any personality denied absolute thereby justifying atheism mc taggart's philosophy fundamentally optimistic
mc taggart believed each souls identified human beings immortal defended idea reincarnation
mc taggart held view selves unoriginated indestructible
nature existence also seeks synthesise mc taggart's denial existence time matter etc
their apparent existence
despite mystical tone conclusions philosophical method nature existence far mystical
mc taggart arrived conclusions careful analysis essential requirements any successful metaphysical system volume followed purported proof system satisfies these requirements volume ii
logical rigour system evidence example mc taggart's famous attempted proof unreality time

moore according martin gardner three known mad tea-party trinity mc taggart dormouse
along russell moore mc taggart member cambridge apostles through personal influence entire generation writers politicians involvement apostles presumably overlapped among others members bloomsbury group
particular mc taggart early influence bertrand russell
through mc taggart young russell converted prevalent hegelianism day russell's reaction against hegelianism began arc later work
mc taggart most influential advocate neo-hegelian idealism cambridge time russell moore's reaction against well being teacher personal acquaintance both men
bradley oxford most prominent surviving british idealists primary target new realists' assault
mc taggart's indirect influence therefore very great
given modern analytic philosophy arguably traced work russell moore period mc taggart's work retains interest historian analytic philosophy despite being very real sense product earlier age
