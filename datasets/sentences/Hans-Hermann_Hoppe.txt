block also shared called minor criticisms hoppe’s theses regarding time preferences immigration gap libertarianism conservatism
according hoppe four years before publication democracy alberto benegas lynch jr
criticized hoppe's thesis monarchy preferable democracy
professor economics university buenos aires benegas lynch provided empirical evidence demonstrating modern monarchies tend far poorer modern democracies
