background dates thales' life exactly known roughly established few datable events mentioned sources
according herodotus determined modern methods thales predicted solar eclipse may 28 585 bc
diogenes laërtius quotes chronicle apollodorus athens saying thales died age 78 during 58 th olympiad 548–545 bc attributes death heat stroke while watching games
diogenes laërtius states according herodotus douris democritus thales' parents examyes cleobuline both wealthy distinguished phoenicians then traces family line back cadmus mythological phoenician prince tyre
diogenes then delivers conflicting reports thales married either fathered son cybisthus cybisthon adopted nephew same name second never married telling mother young man too early marry older man too late
plutarch earlier version solon visited thales asked why remained single thales answered like idea having worry children
nevertheless several years later anxious family adopted nephew cybisthus
thales involved himself many activities taking role innovator
say left no writings others say solstice equinox
no writing attributed survived
diogenes laërtius quotes two letters thales pherecydes syros offering review book religion solon offering keep company sojourn athens
thales identifies milesians athenian colonists
business olive mill olive press dating roman times capernaum israel
several anecdotes suggest thales solely thinker also involved business politics
story recounts bought olive presses miletus after predicting weather good harvest particular year
another version same story aristotle explains thales reserved presses ahead time discount rent them out high price demand peaked following predictions particularly good harvest
first version story constitute first creation use futures whereas second version first creation use options
aristotle explains thales' objective doing enrich himself prove fellow milesians philosophy useful contrary thought
politics thales’ political life mainly involvement ionians defense anatolia against growing power persians then new region
neighbouring lydia king come power croesus somewhat too aggressive size army
conquered most states coastal anatolia including cities ionians
story herodotus
lydians war medes remnant first wave iranians region over issue refuge lydians given scythian soldiers fortune inimical medes
war endured five years sixth eclipse sun mentioned above spontaneously halted battle progress battle halys
total eclipse sun seems thales predicted solar eclipse
seven sages most likely already existence croesus also heavily influenced solon athens another sage
whether thales present battle known nor exact terms prediction based lydians medes made peace immediately swearing blood oath
medes dependencies persians under cyrus
croesus now sided medes against persians marched direction iran far fewer men needed
stopped river halys then unbridged
time thales perhaps invitation
whatever status king gave problem got army across digging diversion upstream reduce flow making possible ford river
channels ran around both sides camp
two armies engaged pteria cappadocia
battle indecisive paralyzing both sides croesus marched home dismissed mercenaries sent emissaries dependents allies ask them dispatch fresh troops sardis
issue became pressing persian army showed up sardis
diogenes laertius tells us thales gained fame counselor advised milesians engage symmachia fighting together lydians
sometimes interpreted alliance ruler does ally subjects
croesus defeated before city sardis cyrus subsequently spared miletus because taken no action
cyrus impressed croesus’ wisdom connection sages spared took advice various matters
ionians now free
herodotus says thales advised them form ionian state bouleuterion deliberative body located teos center ionia
ionian cities should demoi districts
miletus however received favorable terms cyrus
others remained ionian league 12 cities excluding miletus now subjugated persians
while herodotus reported most fellow greeks believe thales divert river halys assist king croesus' military endeavors himself finds doubtful
sagacity ionic stoa sacred way miletus diogenes laertius tells us seven sages created archonship damasius athens 582 bc thales first sage
same story however asserts thales emigrated miletus
there also report become student nature until after political career
much like date seven sages must reject these stories tempting date believe thales native miletus predicted eclipse croesus campaign against cyrus

diogenes laertius' lives eminent philosophers chapter
39 laertius relates several stories expensive object go most wise
version laertius credits callimachus iambics bathycles arcadia states will expensive bowl 'should given done most good wisdom
given thales went round sages came back thales again
sent apollo didyma dedication
'thales milesian son examyas [dedicates this] delphinian apollo after twice winning prize greeks
theories greeks often invoked idiosyncratic explanations natural phenomena reference will anthropomorphic gods heroes
instead thales aimed explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses referenced natural processes themselves
example rather assuming earthquakes result supernatural whims thales explained them hypothesizing earth floats water earthquakes occur earth rocked waves
thales hylozoist thinks matter alive
interpretation later commentators—that thales treated matter being alive—may substituted thinking properties nature arise directly material processes
latter thesis consistent modern ideas how properties arise emergent characteristics those complex systems involved processes evolution developmental change
thales according aristotle asked nature greek arche object behave characteristic way
physis φύσις comes phyein φύειν grow related our word
gnatura way thing born again stamp itself
aristotle characterizes most philosophers first πρῶτον thinking principles form matter principles things principle arche matter hyle wood matter material form eidos
arche translated principle two words precisely same meaning
principle something merely prior related pro- either chronologically logically
arche ἄρχειν rule dominates object way
arche taken origin then specific causality implied supposed characteristically just because comes dominates
archai aristotle mind well-known passage first greek scientists necessarily chronologically prior their objects constituents
example pluralism objects composed earth air fire water those elements disappear production object
remain archai within atoms atomists
aristotle really saying first philosophers trying define substances material objects composed
matter fact exactly modern scientists attempting accomplish nuclear physics second reason why thales described first western scientist
[citation needed] geometry thales known innovative use geometry
understanding theoretical well practical
example megiston topos hapanta gar chorei μέγιστον τόπος· ἄπαντα γὰρ χωρεῖ
“space greatest thing contains things” topos newtonian-style space since verb chorei connotation yielding before things spreading out make room them extension
within extension things position
points lines planes solids related distances angles follow presumption
thales understood similar triangles right triangles used knowledge practical ways
story dl loc
measured height pyramids their shadows moment own shadow equal height
right triangle two equal legs 45-degree right triangle similar
length pyramid’s shadow measured center pyramid moment must equal height
story indicates familiar egyptian seked seqed - ratio run rise slope cotangent
seked base problems 56 57 58 59 60 rhind papyrus ancient egyptian mathematical document
present-day trigonometry cotangents require same units run rise base perpendicular papyrus uses cubits rise palms run resulting different still characteristic numbers
since there 7 palms cubit seked 7 times cotangent
use example often quoted modern reference works suppose base pyramid 140 cubits angle rise 5
25 seked
egyptians expressed their fractions sum fractions decimals sufficient example
rise cubits? run 70 cubits 490 palms
x rise 490 divided 5
25 931⁄3 cubits
these figures sufficed egyptians thales
go calculate cotangent 70 divided 931⁄3 get 3/4
75 looking up table cotangents find angle rise few minutes over 53 degrees
whether ability use seked preceded thales 1000 years means first define trigonometry matter opinion
practically thales used same method measure distances ships sea eudemus reported proclus “in euclidem”
according kirk & raven reference cited below you need feat three straight sticks pinned end knowledge your altitude
stick goes vertically ground
second made level
third you sight ship calculate seked height stick distance point insertion line sight
seked measure angle
knowledge two angles seked right angle enclosed leg altitude allows you determine similar triangles second leg distance
thales probably own equipment rigged recorded own sekeds guess
[citation needed] thales’ theorems thales' theorem main article thales’ theorem main article intercept theorem see also pythagorean theorem there two theorems thales elementary geometry known thales’ theorem having triangle inscribed circle having circle's diameter leg other theorem being also called intercept theorem
addition eudemus attributed discovery circle bisected diameter base angles isosceles triangle equal vertical angles equal
according historical note thales visited egypt observed whenever egyptians drew two intersecting lines measure vertical angles make sure equal
thales concluded prove vertical angles equal accepted general notions such straight angles equal equals added equals equal equals subtracted equals equal
water first principle thales' most famous philosophical position cosmological thesis comes down us through passage aristotle's metaphysics
work aristotle unequivocally reported thales’ hypothesis nature matter originating principle nature single material substance water
aristotle then proceeded proffer number conjectures based own observations lend credence why thales may advanced idea though aristotle didn’t hold himself
aristotle considered thales’ position roughly equivalent later ideas anaximenes held everything composed air
aristotle laid out own thinking matter form may shed light ideas thales metaphysics 983 b6 8–11 17–21
passage contains words later adopted science quite different meanings
everything exists first becomes rendered last substance remaining under transforming qualities say element principle things
…for necessary there nature φύσις either become other things object being saved
thales founder type philosophy says water
quote see aristotle's depiction problem change definition substance
asked object changes same different? either case how there change other? answer substance saved acquires loses different qualities πάθη things you experience
aristotle conjectured thales reached conclusion contemplating nourishment things moist even hot created wet lives
while aristotle’s conjecture why thales held water originating principle water own thinking statement thales held water generally accepted genuinely originating thales seen incipient matter-and-formist
heraclitus homericus states thales drew conclusion seeing moist substance turn air slime earth
seems likely thales viewed earth solidifying water floated oceans surround
writing centuries later diogenes laertius also states thales taught water constituted ὑπεστήσατο 'stood under' principle things
1870 book dictionary greek roman biography mythology noted thales dogma water origin things out every thing arises every thing resolves itself thales may followed orphic cosmogonies while unlike them sought establish truth assertion
hence aristotle immediately after called originator philosophy brings forward reasons thales believed adduced confirmation assertion no written development indeed any book thales extant proved expressions aristotle uses brings forward doctrines proofs milesian
1016 influences later scholastic thinkers maintain choice water thales influenced babylonian chaldean religion held god begun creation acting upon pre-existing water
historian abraham feldman holds does stand up under closer examination
babylonian religion water lifeless sterile until god acts upon thales water itself divine creative
maintained things full gods understand nature things discover secrets deities through knowledge open possibility greater grandest olympian
feldman points out while other thinkers recognized wetness world none them inspired conclude everything ultimately aquatic
further points out thales wealthy citizen fabulously rich oriental port miletus
dealer staples antiquity wine oil
certainly handled shell-fish phoenicians secreted dye imperial purple
feldman recalls stories thales measuring distance boats harbor creating mechanical improvements ship navigation giving explanation flooding nile vital egyptian agriculture greek trade changing course river halys army ford
rather seeing water barrier thales contemplated ionian yearly religious gathering athletic ritual held promontory mycale believed ordained ancestral kindred poseidon god sea
called ionian mercantile states participating ritual convert democratic federation under protection poseidon hold off forces pastoral persia
feldman concludes thales saw water revolutionary leveler elemental factor determining subsistence business world common channel states
feldman considers thales' environment holds thales seen tears sweat blood granting value person's work means how life giving commodities travelled whether bodies water through sweat slaves pack-animals
seen minerals processed water such life-sustaining salt gold taken rivers
would’ve seen fish other food stuffs gathered
feldman points out thales held lodestone alive drew metals itself
holds thales living ever sight beloved sea see water seem draw traffic wine oil milk honey juices dyes itself leading vision universe melting single substance valueless itself still source wealth
feldman concludes thales
water united things
social significance water time thales induced discern through hardware dry-goods through soil sperm blood sweat tears fundamental fluid stuff
water most commonplace powerful material known
combined contemporary’s idea spontaneous generation allow us see how thales hold water divine creative
feldman points lasting association theory whatness wetness thales himself pointing out diogenes laertius speaks poem probably satire thales snatched heaven sun perhaps elaborate paronomasia based fact thal phoenician word dew

noteworthy first particle known carry electric charge electron named greek word amber ἤλεκτρον ēlektron
how power move other things without movers changing explained? thales saw commonality powers living things act
lodestone amber must alive there no difference living dead

aristotle defined soul principle life imbues matter makes live giving animation power act

things alive must souls
belief no innovation ordinary ancient populations mediterranean believe natural actions caused divinities
accordingly sources[which?] say thales believed things full gods
their zeal make first everything first hold belief must widely known false
however thales looking something general universal substance mind
[citation needed] also polytheism times
zeus very personification supreme mind dominating subordinate manifestations
thales however philosophers tendency depersonify objectify mind though substance animation per se actually god like other gods
end result total removal mind substance opening door non-divine principle action
classical thought however proceeded little way along path
instead referring person zeus talked great mind thales says cicero assures water principle things god mind shaped created things water
universal mind appears roman belief virgil well beginning spirit within spiritus intus strengthens heaven earth watery fields lucid globe luna then -- titan stars mind mens infused through limbs agitates whole mass mixes itself great matter magno corpore according henry fielding diogenes laërtius affirmed thales posed independent pre-existence god eternity stating god oldest beings existed without previous cause even way generation world most beautiful things created god
reputation thales died around 30 years before time pythagoras 300 years before euclid eudoxus cnidus eudemus rhodes often hailed first greek mathematician
while historians such colin r
fletcher point out there predecessor thales would've named eudemus' lost book history geometry admitted without work question becomes mere speculation
fletcher holds there no viable predecessor title first greek mathematician question whether thales qualifies practitioner field holds thales command techniques observation experimentation superposition deduction…he proved himself mathematician
evidence primacy thales comes us book proclus thousand years after thales believed copy eudemus' book
proclus thales first go egypt bring back greece study
goes tell us addition applying knowledge gained egypt himself discovered many propositions disclosed underlying principles many others successors case method being general others empirical
other quotes proclus list thales' mathematical achievements say thales first demonstrate circle bisected diameter cause bisection being unimpeded passage straight line through centre
[thales] first known enunciated [the theorem] angles base any isosceles triangle equal though archaic manner described equal angles similar
theorem two straight lines cut another vertical opposite angles equal first discovered eudemus says thales though scientific demonstration improved writer elements
eudemus history geometry attributes theorem [the equality triangles having two angles side equal] thales
says method thales showed how find distance ships sea necessarily involves method
pamphila says having learnt geometry egyptians [thales] first inscribe circle right-angled triangle whereupon sacrificed ox
addition proclus hieronymus rhodes also cites thales first greek mathematician
hieronymus held thales able measure height pyramids using theorem geometry now known intercept theorem after gathering data using walking-stick comparing shadow those cast pyramids
receive variations hieronymus' story through diogenes laertius pliny elder plutarch
due variations among testimonies such story sacrifice ox occasion discovery angle diameter circle right angle version diogenes laertius being accredited pythagoras rather thales historians such
dicks question whether such anecdotes any historical worth whatsoever

historian roger l
cooke points out proclus does make any mention mesopotamian influence thales greek geometry shown clearly greek astronomy use sexagesimal system measuring angles ptolemy's explicit use mesopotamian astronomical observations
cooke notes may possibly also appear second book euclid's elements contains geometric constructions equivalent certain algebraic relations frequently encountered cuneiform tablets
cooke notes relation however controversial
van waerden among those advocating idea mesopotamian influence writing follows abandon traditional belief oldest greek mathematicians discovered geometry entirely themselves…a belief tenable long nothing known babylonian mathematics
no way diminishes stature thales contrary genius receives now honour due honour having developed logical structure geometry having introduced proof geometry
historians such
dicks takes issue idea determine questionable sources just how influenced thales babylonian sources

bychkov holds idea base angles isosceles triangle equal likely came egypt
because building roof home - having cross section exactly isosceles triangle isn't crucial it's ridge roof must fit precisely contrast symmetric square pyramid cannot errors base angles faces will fit together tightly
dicks agrees compared greeks era thales there advanced state mathematics among babylonians especially egyptians - both cultures knew correct formulae determining areas volumes simple geometrical figures such triangles rectangles trapezoids etc
egyptians also calculate correctly volume frustum pyramid square base babylonians used incorrect formula used formula area circle
gives value π 3
1605--a good approximation
dicks also agrees effect thales whom most ancient sources agree interested mathematics astronomy holds tales thales' travels these lands pure myth
ancient civilization massive monuments egypt profound ineradicable impression greeks
attributed egyptians immemorial knowledge certain subjects including geometry claim egyptian origin their own ideas try lend them respectable antiquity such hermetic literature alexandrian period
dicks holds since thales prominent figure greek history time eudemus nothing certain known except lived miletus
tradition developed milesians position able travel widely thales must gone egypt
herodotus says egypt birthplace geometry must learnt while there
since there surely theories nile flooding laid out herodotus must come thales
likewise must egypt done something pyramids - thus tale measuring them
similar apocryphal stories exist pythagoras plato traveling egypt no corroborating evidence
egyptian babylonian geometry time essentially arithmetical used actual numbers procedure then described explicit instructions these numbers there no mention how rules procedure made nothing toward logically arranged corpus generalized geometrical knowledge analytical 'proofs' such find words euclid archimedes apollonius

interpretations long sojourn philosophy there existed hardly philosopher historian philosophy mention thales try characterize way
generally recognized having brought something new human thought
mathematics astronomy medicine already existed
thales added something these different collections knowledge produce universality far writing tells us tradition before resulted new field
ever since interested persons asking new something
answers fall least two categories theory method
once answer arrived next logical step ask how thales compares other philosophers leads classification rightly wrongly
theory most natural epithets thales materialist naturalist based ousia physis
catholic encyclopedia notes aristotle called physiologist meaning student nature
other hand qualified early physicist aristotle
studied corpora bodies medieval descendants substances
most agree thales' stamp thought unity substance hence bertrand russell view matter quite reputable scientific hypothesis
still handsome feat discovered substance remains same different states aggregation
russell reflecting established tradition example nietzsche philosophy tragic age greeks greek philosophy seems begin absurd notion proposition water primal origin womb things
really necessary us take serious notice proposition? three reasons
first because tells us something primal origin things second because does language devoid image fable finally because contained embryonically thought 'all things
sort materialism however should confused deterministic materialism
thales trying explain unity observed free play qualities
arrival uncertainty modern world made possible return thales example john elof boodin writes god creation cannot read universe past
boodin defines emergent materialism objects sense emerge uncertainly substrate
thales innovator sort materialism
rise theoretical inquiry west thales represents new kind inquiring community well
edmund husserl attempts capture new movement follows
philosophical man new cultural configuration based stepping back pregiven tradition taking up rational inquiry true itself ideal truth
begins isolated individuals such thales supported cooperated time goes
finally ideal transforms norms society leaping across national borders
classification term pre-socratic derives ultimately philosopher aristotle distinguished early philosophers concerning themselves substance
diogenes laertius other hand took strictly geographic ethnic approach
philosophers either ionian italian
used ionian broader sense including also athenian academics pre-socratics
philosophic point view any grouping just effective
there no basis ionian italian unity
scholars however concede diogenes' scheme far referring ionian school
there no such school any sense
most popular approach refers milesian school justifiable socially philosophically
sought substance phenomena may studied each other
ancient writers qualify them milesioi miletus
influence others thales electricity sculpture progress railroading 1908 main facade union station washington dc thales profound influence other greek thinkers therefore western history
believe anaximander pupil thales
early sources report anaximander's famous pupils pythagoras visited thales young man thales advised travel egypt further philosophical mathematical studies
many philosophers followed thales' lead searching explanations nature rather supernatural others returned supernatural explanations couched them language philosophy rather myth religion
looking specifically thales' influence during pre-socratic era clear stood out first thinkers thought way logos mythos
difference these two profound ways seeing world mythos concentrated around stories holy origin while logos concentrated around argumentation
mythical man wants explain world way sees explains based gods powers
mythical thought does differentiate things persons[citation needed] furthermore does differentiate nature culture[citation needed]
way logos thinker present world view radically different way mythical thinker
concrete form logos way thinking individualism[clarification needed] also abstract[clarification needed]
furthermore focuses sensible continuous argumentation
lays foundation philosophy way explaining world terms abstract argumentation way gods mythical stories[citation needed]
reliability sources thales nuremberg chronicle
because thales' elevated status greek culture intense interest admiration followed reputation
due following oral stories life open amplification historical fabrication even before written down generations later
most modern dissension comes trying interpret know particular distinguishing legend fact
dicks other historians divide ancient sources thales those before 320 bc those after year such proclus writing 5 th century c
simplicius cilicia 6 th century c
writing nearly millennium after era
first category includes herodotus plato aristotle aristophanes theophrastus among others
second category includes plautus aetius eusebius plutarch josephus iamblichus diogenes laërtius theon smyrna apuleius clement alexandria pliny elder john tzetzes among others
earliest sources thales living before 320 bc often same other milesian philosophers anaximander anaximenes
these sources either roughly contemporaneous such herodotus lived within few hundred years passing
moreover writing oral tradition widespread well known greece their day
latter sources thales several ascriptions commentators compilers lived anything 700 1000 years after death include anecdotes varying degrees plausibility opinion historians such
dicks no historical worth whatsoever
dicks points out there no agreement among 'authorities' even most fundamental facts life--e
whether milesian phoenician whether left any writings whether married single-much less actual ideas achievements credited
contrasting work ancient writers those later dicks points out works early writers thales other men hailed seven sages greece different reputation assigned them later authors
closer their own era thales solon bias priene pittacus mytilene others hailed essentially practical men played leading roles affairs their respective states far better known earlier greeks lawgivers statesmen profound thinkers philosophers
example plato praises coupled anacharsis being originator potter's wheel anchor
writings second group writers working after 320 bc obtain picture thales pioneer greek scientific thinking particularly regard mathematics astronomy supposed learnt babylonia egypt
rather earlier tradition [where] favourite example intelligent man possesses technical 'know how'
later doxographers [such dicaearchus latter half fourth century bc] foist any number discoveries achievements order build up figure superhuman wisdom
dicks points out further problem arises surviving information thales rather using ancient sources closer era thales authors later antiquity epitomators excerptors compilers actually preferred use intermediaries actually read them comes us even second third fourth fifth hand
obviously use intermediate sources copied recopied century century each writer adding additional pieces information greater less plausibility own knowledge provided fertile field errors transmission wrong ascriptions fictitious attributions
dicks points out certain doctrines later commentators invented thales
then accepted biographical tradition being copied subsequent writers then cited those coming after them thus because may repeated different authors relying different sources may produce illusory impression genuineness
doubts even exist considering philosophical positions held originate thales reality these stem directly aristotle's own interpretations then became incorporated doxographical tradition erroneous ascriptions thales
same treatment given aristotle anaxagoras
most philosophic analyses philosophy thales come aristotle professional philosopher tutor alexander great 200 years after thales' death
aristotle judging surviving books does seem access any works thales although probably access works other authors thales such herodotus hecataeus plato etc
well others whose work now extinct
aristotle's express goal present thales' work because significant itself prelude own work natural philosophy
geoffrey kirk john raven english compilers fragments pre-socratics assert aristotle's judgments often distorted view earlier philosophy stumbling progress toward truth aristotle himself revealed physical doctrines
there also extensive oral tradition
both oral written commonly read known educated men region
aristotle's philosophy distinct stamp professed theory matter form modern scholastics dubbed hylomorphism
though once very widespread generally adopted rationalist modern science mainly useful metaphysical analyses does lend itself detail interest modern science
clear theory matter form existed early thales whether thales espoused
while historians like
snell maintain aristotle relying pre-platonic written record hippias rather oral tradition controversial position
representing scholarly consensus dicks states tradition even early fifth century
evidently based entirely hearsay
seem already aristotle's time early ionians largely names popular tradition attached various ideas achievements greater less plausibility
points out works confirmed existed sixth century bc anaximander xenophanes already disappeared fourth century bc chances pre-socratic material surviving age aristotle almost nil even less likely aristotle's pupils theophrastus eudemus less likely still those following after them
main secondary source concerning details thales' life career diogenes laertius lives eminent philosophers
primarily biographical work name indicates
compared aristotle diogenes much philosopher
prologue work responsible division early philosophers ionian italian places academics ionian school otherwise evidences considerable disarray contradiction especially long section forerunners ionian school
diogenes quotes two letters attributed thales diogenes eight centuries after thales' death sources often contained unreliable even fabricated information hence concern separating fact legend accounts thales
due use hearsay lack citing original sources leads historians like dicks werner jaeger look late origin traditional picture pre-socratic philosophy view whole idea construct later age whole picture come down us history early philosophy fashioned during two three generations plato immediate pupils aristotle
