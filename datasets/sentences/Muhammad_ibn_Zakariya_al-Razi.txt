may smallpox vs
measles smallpox appears blood 'boils' infected resulting vapours being expelled
thus juvenile blood looks like wet extracts appearing skin being transformed richer blood having color mature wine
stage smallpox shows up essentially 'bubbles found wine' blisters
disease also occur other times meaning during childhood -
best thing during first stage keep away otherwise disease might turn epidemic
diagnosis acknowledged encyclopaedia britannica 1911 states most trustworthy statements early existence disease found account 9 th-century persian physician rhazes whom symptoms clearly described pathology explained humoral fermentation theory directions given treatment
razi's book al-judari wa al-hasbah smallpox measles first book describing smallpox measles distinct diseases
translated dozen times latin other european languages
lack dogmatism hippocratic reliance clinical observation show razi's medical methods
example eruption smallpox preceded continued fever pain back itching nose nightmares during sleep
these acute symptoms approach together noticeable pain back accompanied fever itching felt patient over body
swelling face appears comes goes notices overall inflammatory color noticeable strong redness both cheeks around both eyes
experiences heaviness whole body great restlessness expresses itself lot stretching yawning
there pain throat chest finds difficult breathe cough
additional symptoms dryness breath thick spittle hoarseness voice pain heaviness head restlessness nausea anxiety
note difference restlessness nausea anxiety occur frequently 'measles' smallpox
other hand pain back apparent smallpox measles
altogether experiences heat over whole body inflamed colon shows overall shining redness very pronounced redness gums
rhazese encyclopaedia medicine pharmacy razi contributed many ways early practice pharmacy compiling texts introduces use 'mercurial ointments' development apparatus such mortars flasks spatulas phials used pharmacies until early twentieth century
ethics medicine professional level razi introduced many practical progressive medical psychological ideas
attacked charlatans fake doctors roamed cities countryside selling their nostrums cures
same time warned even highly educated doctors answers medical problems cure sicknesses heal every disease humanly speaking impossible
become useful their services truer their calling razi advised practitioners keep up advanced knowledge continually studying medical books exposing themselves new information
made distinction curable incurable diseases
pertaining latter commented case advanced cases cancer leprosy physician should blamed cure them
add humorous note razi felt great pity physicians took care well being princes nobility women because obey doctor's orders restrict their diet get medical treatment thus making most difficult being their physician
also following medical ethics doctor's aim good even our enemies much our friends my profession forbids us harm our kindred instituted benefit welfare human race god imposed physicians oath compose mortiferous remedies
books articles medicine virtuous life al-hawi الحاوي
monumental medical encyclopedia nine volumes known europe also large comprehensive continens liber جامع الكبير — contains considerations criticism greek philosophers aristotle plato expresses innovative views many subjects
because book alone many scholars consider razi greatest medical doctor middle ages
al-hawi formal medical encyclopedia posthumous compilation razi's working notebooks included knowledge gathered other books well original observations diseases therapies based own clinical experience
significant since contains celebrated monograph smallpox earliest known
translated latin 1279 faraj ben salim physician sicilian-jewish origin employed charles anjou after considerable influence europe
al-hawi also criticized views galen after razi observed many clinical cases follow galen's descriptions fevers
example stated galen's descriptions urinary ailments inaccurate seen three cases while razi studied hundreds such cases hospitals baghdad rey
medical adviser general public man yahduruhu al-tabib من لا يحضره الطبيب razi possibly first persian doctor deliberately write home medical manual remedial directed general public
dedicated poor traveler ordinary citizen consult treatment common ailments doctor available
book course special interest history pharmacy since similar books very popular until 20 th century
razi described 36 chapters diets drug components found either apothecary market place well-equipped kitchens military camps
thus every intelligent person follow instructions prepare proper recipes good results
illnesses treated headaches colds coughing melancholy diseases eye ear stomach
example prescribed feverish headache 2 parts duhn oily extract rose mixed part vinegar piece linen cloth dipped compressed forehead
recommended laxative 7 drams dried violet flowers 20 pears macerated well mixed then strained
add filtrate 20 drams sugar drink
cases melancholy invariably recommended prescriptions included either poppies juice opium cuscuta epithymum clover dodder both
eye-remedy advised myrrh saffron frankincense 2 drams each mixed dram yellow arsenic formed tablets
each tablet dissolved sufficient quantity coriander water used eye drops
doubts galen shukuk 'ala alinusor book doubts galen razi rejects several claims made greek physician far alleged superiority greek language many cosmological medical views
links medicine philosophy states sound practice demands independent thinking
reports galen's descriptions agree own clinical observations regarding run fever
cases finds clinical experience exceeds galen's
criticized moreover galen's theory body possessed four separate humors liquid substances whose balance key health natural body-temperature
sure way upset such system insert liquid different temperature body resulting increase decrease bodily heat resembled temperature particular fluid
razi noted warm drink heat up body degree much higher own natural temperature
thus drink trigger response body rather transferring own warmth coldness
goodman line criticism essentially potentiality destroy completely galen's theory humours including aristotle's theory four elements grounded
razi's own alchemical experiments suggested other qualities matter such oiliness sulphurousness inflammability salinity readily explained traditional fire water earth air division elements
razi's challenge current fundamentals medical theory quite controversial
many accused ignorance arrogance even though repeatedly expressed praise gratitude galen contributions labors saying prayed god direct lead me truth writing book
grieves me oppose criticize man galen whose sea knowledge drawn much
indeed master am disciple
although reverence appreciation will should prevent me doubting erroneous theories
imagine feel deeply my heart galen chosen me undertake task alive congratulated me am doing
say because galen's aim seek find truth bring light out darkness
wish indeed alive read published
crystallization ancient knowledge refusal accept fact new data ideas indicate present day knowledge ultimately might surpass previous generations
razi believed contemporary scientists scholars far better equipped knowledgeable competent ancient ones due accumulated knowledge their disposal
razi's attempt overthrow blind acceptance unchallenged authority ancient sages encouraged stimulated research advances arts technology sciences
diseases children razi's diseases children first book deal pediatrics independent field medicine

transmutation metals razi's interest alchemy strong belief possibility transmutation lesser metals silver gold attested half century after death ibn an-nadim's book philosophers stone-lapis philosophorum latin
nadim attributed series twelve books razi plus additional seven including refutation al-kindi's denial validity alchemy
al-kindi 801–873 ce appointed abbasid caliph ma'mum founder baghdad 'the house wisdom' city philosopher opponent alchemy
razi's two best-known alchemical texts largely superseded earlier ones al-asrar الاسرار secrets sirr al-asrar سر الاسرار secret secrets incorporates much previous work
apparently razi's contemporaries believed obtained secret turning iron copper gold
biographer khosro moetazed reports mohammad zakaria razi certain general simjur confronted razi public asked whether underlying reason willingness treat patients without fee
appeared those present razi reluctant answer looked sideways general replied understand alchemy working characteristic properties metals extended time
however still turned out evident me how transmute gold copper
despite research ancient scientists done over past centuries there no answer
very much doubt possible
according legend blinded steaming vapors during accident experiments
managed escape no injuries
[verification needed] chemical instruments substances razi developed several chemical instruments remain use day
known perfected methods distillation gain alcohol[citation needed] extraction
ar-razi dismissed idea potions dispensed magic meaning reliance symbols causes
although razi does reject idea miracles exist sense unexplained phenomena nature alchemical stockroom enriched products persian mining manufacturing even sal ammoniac chinese discovery
relied predominantly concept 'dominant' forms essences neoplatonic conception causality rather intellectual approach mechanical
[citation needed] razi's alchemy brings forward such empiric qualities salinity inflammability -the latter associated 'oiliness' 'sulphurousness'
these properties readily explained traditional composition elements such fire water earth air al-óhazali others after quick note influenced critical thoughts such razi

* amount heat fire used 'bodies stones' 'al-ajsad' 'al-ahjar cannot transmuted corporal substances such metals id salts 'al-amlah'
* use liquid mordant quickly permanently colors lesser metals lucrative sale profit
similar commentary th century text amalgams ascribed al- hayan jabir razi gives methods procedures coloring silver object imitate gold gold leafing reverse technique removing color back silver
gilding silvering other metals alum calcium salts iron copper tutty also described well how colors will last years without tarnishing changing
behind these procedures does find deceptive motive rather technical economic deliberation
becomes evident author's quotation market prices expressed triumph artisan craftsman alchemist declaring results their efforts make look exactly like gold!
however another motive involved namely manufacture something resembling gold sold quickly help good friend happened need money fast

excerpt philosophical approach
short while am writing present book written far around 200 books articles different aspects science philosophy theology hekmat wisdom
never entered service any king military man man office ever conversation king never went beyond my medical responsibility advice
those seen me know excess eating drinking acting wrong way
my interest science people know perfectly well must witnessed how devoted my life science since my youth
my patience diligence pursuit science such special issue specifically written 20000 pages small print moreover spent fifteen years my life -night day- writing big collection entitled al hawi
during time lost my eyesight my hand became paralyzed result am now deprived reading writing
nonetheless i've never given up kept reading writing help others
make concessions my opponents admit shortcomings am most curious say my scientific achievement
consider my approach incorrect present their views state their points clearly may study them determined their views right admit
however disagreed discuss matter prove my standpoint
case merely disagree my approach way life appreciate use my written knowledge stop interfering my behaviour
philosophical biography seen above defended personal philosophical life style
work laid out framework based idea there life after death full happiness suffering
rather being self-indulgent man should pursue knowledge utilise intellect apply justice life
according al-razi our merciful creator wants
whom pray reward whose punishment fear
brief man should kind gentle just
al-razi believed there close relationship spiritual integrity physical health
implicate soul avoid distress due fear death
simply states psychological state cannot avoided completely unless individual convinced after death soul will lead better life
requires thorough study esoteric doctrines and/or religions
focuses opinion people think soul perishes body dies
death inevitable therefore should pre-occupy mind because any person continuously thinks death will become distressed think dying continuously ponders subject
therefore should forget order avoid upsetting himself
contemplating destiny after death benevolent good man acts according ordinances islamic shari`ah after nothing fear because indicates will comfort permanent bliss hereafter
doubts shari`ah may contemplate diligently does will deviate right path
falls short allah will excuse forgive sins because demanded something cannot achieve

other views quotes often ascribed razi found book written abu hatim al-razi called aʿlām al-nubuwwa signs prophecy any extant work razi
abu hatim isma'ili missionary debated razi whether faithfully recorded views razi disputed
according abdul latif al-'abd islamic philosophy professor cairo university abu hatim student ḥamīd al-dīn karmānī
after 411 ah/1020 ce isma'ili extremists often misrepresented views razi their works
view also corroborated early historians like al-shahrastani noted such accusations should doubted since made ismāʿīlīs severely attacked muḥammad ibn zakariyyā rāzī
al-'abd points out views allegedly expressed razi contradict found razi's own works like spiritual medicine fī al-ṭibb al-rūḥānī
peter adamson concurs abu hatim may deliberately misdescribed razi's position rejection islam revealed religions
instead razi arguing against use miracles prove muhammad's prophecy anthropomorphism uncritical acceptance taqlīd vs naẓar
adamson also points out work fakhr al-din al-razi razi quoted citing quran prophets support views
historians such paul kraus sarah stroumsa accept extracts found abu hatim's book either razi during debate quoted now lost work
suggest lost work either famous al-ʿilm al-ilāhī another shorter independent work called makharīq al-anbiyāʾ prophets' fraudulent tricks
abu hatim however explicitly mention razi name book referred interlocutor simply mulḥid lit
according debate abu hatim razi denied validity prophecy other authority figures rejected prophetic miracles
also directed scathing critique revealed religions miraculous quality quran
because being seemingly unrestrained any religious philosophical tradition razi came admired freethinker
criticism al-razi's religious philosophical views later criticized abu rayhan biruni avicenna early th century
biruni particular short treatise risala dealing al-razi criticizing sympathy manichaeism hermetical writings religious philosophical views refusing mathematize physics active opposition mathematics
avicenna himself physician philosopher also criticized al-razi
