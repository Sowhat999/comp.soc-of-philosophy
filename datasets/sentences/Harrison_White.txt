generally white students sparked interest looking society networks rather aggregates individuals
view still controversial
sociology organizational science difficult measure cause effect systematic way
because common use sampling techniques discover sort average population
instance almost daily how average european american feels topic
allows social scientists pundits make inferences cause say “people angry current administration because economy doing poorly
kind generalization certainly makes sense does tell us anything individual
leads idea idealized individual something bedrock modern economics
most modern economic theories look social formations like organizations products individuals acting their own best interest
while proved useful cases does account well knowledge required structures sustain themselves
white students students' students developing models incorporate patterns relationships descriptions social formations
line work includes economic sociology network sociology structuralist sociology
identity control white’s most comprehensive work identity control
first edition came out 1992 second edition appeared june 2008
book white discusses social world including “persons” emerging patterns relationships
argues default human heuristic organize world terms attributes often mistake
instance there countless books leadership look attributes make good leader
however no leader without followers term describes relationship others
without relationships there no leader
likewise organization viewed patterns relationships
“exist” people honor maintain specific relationships
white avoids giving attributes things emerge patterns relationships something goes against our natural instincts requires thought process
