died exile apparently without any previously diagnosed illness damascus august 3 1999
transliteration name al-bayati abd al-wahhab's last name should spelled al-bayyati double yy arabic being transliterated another language meaning change become boarder pupil boarding school
common mistake made last name al-bayati even arabic assumed name whose root ba ya ta / ب ي ت arabic origins therefore expected follow arabic faʿʿaal / فعَّال noun type used denote intensity repetition profession
name al-bayati denotes comes bayat tribe قبيلة بيات largest turcoman tribes iraq entering area oghuz turk migrations 9 th–12 th centuries c
iraq although al-bayatis know tribal source their name does necessarily indicate linguistic cultural identity bayat tribe there largely arabised through intermarriage linguistic assimilation
