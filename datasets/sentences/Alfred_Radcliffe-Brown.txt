work described classic bronisław malinowski's romantic
radcliffe-brown brought french sociology namely émile durkheim british anthropology constructing rigorous battery concepts frame ethnography
greatly influenced work émile durkheim saw institutions key maintaining global social order society analogous organs body studies social function examine how customs aid maintaining overall stability society
[citation needed] concept function radcliffe-brown often associated functionalism considered founder structural functionalism
nonetheless radcliffe-brown vehemently denied being functionalist carefully distinguished concept function malinowski openly advocated functionalism
while malinowski's functionalism claimed social practices directly explained their ability satisfy basic biological needs radcliffe-brown rejected baseless
instead influenced process philosophy alfred north whitehead claimed fundamental units anthropology processes human life interaction
because these definition characterised constant flux calls explanation occurrence stability
why radcliffe-brown asked patterns social practices repeat themselves even seem become fixed? reasoned least require other practices must conflict them too much cases may practices grow support each other notion called 'coadaptation' deriving biological term
functional analysis then just attempt explain stability discovering how practices fit together sustain stability 'function' practice just role sustaining overall social structure insofar there stable social structure radcliffe-brown 1957
far 'functional explanation' later impugned carl hempel others
also clearly distinct malinowski's notion function point often ignored radcliffe-brown's detractors
[citation needed] malinowski explained inventor functionalism gave name
definition clear theory doctrine every feature culture any people past present explained reference seven biological needs individual human beings
cannot speak other writers whom label functionalist applied authors though very much doubt redfield linton accept doctrine
myself reject entirely regarding useless worse
consistent opponent malinowski's functionalism may called anti-functionalist
concept social structure while lévi-strauss 1958 claimed social structure social relations constituents theoretical constructions used model social life radcliffe-brown half-agreed say studying social structures exactly same thing saying study social relations how sociologists define their subject
particular social relation two persons unless adam eve garden eden exists part wide network social relations involving many other persons network regard object our investigations
am aware course term social structure used number different senses them very vague
unfortunately true many other terms commonly used anthropologists
choice terms their definitions matter scientific convenience characteristics science soon passed first formative period existence technical terms used same precise meaning students science
test regret say social anthropology reveals itself yet formed science
'' addition identifying abstract relationships social structures radcliffe-brown argued importance notion 'total social structure' sum total social relations given social unit analysis during given period
identification 'functions' social practices supposed relative total social structure
lévi-strauss saw social structure model
evolutionism diffusionism role social anthropology major view study tribal societies societies follow unilineal path 'evolutionism' therefore 'primitive' societies understood earlier stages along path conversely 'modern' societies contained vestiges older forms
another view social practices tend develop once therefore commonalities differences societies explained historical reconstruction interaction societies 'diffusionism'
according both these views proper way explain differences tribal societies modern ones historical reconstruction
radcliffe-brown rejected both these views because untestable nature historical reconstructions
instead argued use comparative method find regularities human societies thereby build up genuinely scientific knowledge social life
social anthropology task formulate validate statements conditions existence social systems laws social statics regularities observable social change laws social dynamics
done systematic use comparative method justification method expectation will provide us results kind boas stated will provide us knowledge laws social development
will integrated organised study historical studies sociological studies combined shall able reach real understanding development human society end radcliffe-brown argued 'natural science society'
claimed there independent role social anthropology here separate psychology though conflict
because psychology study individual mental processes while social anthropology study processes interaction people social relations
thus argued principled ontological distinction psychology social anthropology same way might try make principled distinction physics biology
moreover claimed existing social scientific disciplines possible exception linguistics arbitrary once our knowledge society sufficient argued will able form subdisciplines anthropology centred around relatively isolated parts social structure
without extensive scientific knowledge impossible know these boundaries should drawn
ethnography radcliffe-brown carried out extensive fieldwork andaman islands australia elsewhere
basis research contributed extensively anthropological ideas kinship criticised lévi-strauss's alliance theory
also produced structural analyses myths including basis concept binary distinctions dialectical opposition idea later echoed lévi-strauss
