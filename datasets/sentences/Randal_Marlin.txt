that's time people will act make changes traffic patterns
don't miss opportunity something like comes up
marlin's growing interest persuasion took added dimensions began reading technological society jacques ellul

propaganda ethics 2002 marlin published propaganda ethics persuasion book now serves texts university course propaganda
contains extensive information propaganda including various definitions brief history ancient times 20 th century discussion propaganda techniques
marlin bases own definition propaganda sees three main features
first propaganda aims influence many people organized deliberate ways
second likely deceive target audience third uses psychological influences suppress bypass rational thought
therefore marlin defines propaganda organized attempt through communication affect belief action inculcate attitudes large audience ways circumvent suppress individual's adequately informed rational reflective judgment
chapters ethics marlin suggests propaganda ethically questionable because tries manipulate using misleading information emotional appeals psychological pressure
notes although tend associate propaganda political power ideology also includes other forms persuasion such advertising public relations
atrocity propaganda propaganda ethics persuasion marlin notes atrocity propaganda used demonize wartime enemies
writes example during world war british propaganda accused german soldiers publicly raping women town square decapitating babies forcing parents watch their children's hands ears cut off
american public relations firm hill & knowlton resorted atrocity propaganda during 1990/91 gulf war spread story iraqi soldiers invaded kuwait ripping helpless kuwaiti babies hospital incubators
corpse factory story textbook other writings marlin examines specific example world war atrocity propaganda illustrate propaganda techniques
corpse factory story incited hatred loathing germans supposedly boiling their own dead soldiers extract their bodies lubricating oil fats soap glue glycerine explosives bonemeal animal feed fertilizer
according marlin's research story likely concocted british belgian propagandists london then spread far wide beginning april 17 1917 times daily mail newspapers owned lord northcliffe man close connections british propaganda
northcliffe papers gave story credibility combining mistranslated report german newspaper dead horses being boiled down glue invented story ostensibly belgian newspapers quoting detailed eyewitness description dead german soldiers being dumped huge cauldron corpse exploitation establishment
other news media spread gruesome story worldwide
propaganda techniques marlin writes corpse factory story illustrates seven requirements effective propaganda outlined 1938 book propaganda boom
those requirements repetition northcliffe papers kept story going day after day publishing readers' letters
colour eyewitness description corpse factory appealed readers' imaginations
kernel truth germans plants boil down animal carcasses
slogans story gave support such propaganda slogans germans ghouls
specific objective story incited hatred germans encouraged people join fight against them
concealed motive publishing reports foreign papers obscured source propaganda
timing mistranslated german report animal rendering plant coincided concocted belgian corpse factory report
according marlin joachim neander corpse factory story also illustrates other propaganda techniques including use deceptive language appeal emotion big lie
write after story exposed false 1925 people determined fooled again
thus many doubted reports holocaust early world war ii—testimony long-lasting harmful effects atrocity propaganda
two propaganda theorists marlin makes clear propaganda ethics persuasion george orwell jacques ellul strongly influenced own writing
refers both thinkers major propaganda theorists sought expose forces work integrating individual larger system frustrating individual's self-development freedom
george orwell marlin credits orwell effectively passionately exposing enslaving effects propagandistic language
points newspeak language orwell invented satirical novel nineteen eighty-four illustrate how words reinforce totalitarian power police state eradicating historical memory narrowing range thought
marlin also refers orwell's famous 1946 essay politics english language describes example how euphemism such pacification served cover up state violence murder
extraordinary thing marlin notes exactly same word exactly same kind activity used vietnam war many years later
marlin writes orwell showed how owners weekly magazines used adventure stories comics transmit capitalist imperialist values partly through repeated use class national stereotypes
observes most effective propaganda recognized such message often best presented obliquely
jacques ellul there probably no other thinker thought deeply propaganda dimensions ramifications jacques ellul marlin writes
sets apart other analysts rare unique combination expertise history sociology law political science along careful study biblical marxist writings
marlin adds ellul propaganda technique promotes acceptance other techniques mass society people routinely victims illusion technology will solve our problems
thus propaganda needed adjust people conditions imposed technological development --- conditions may require them adapt increasingly inescapable requirements technological system
elsewhere marlin argued large powerful vested interests benefit calls technological system generate systematic propaganda glorifying technology
review ellul's book technological bluff marlin comments obscene way american television lavished praise smart bombs during 1990-1991 persian gulf war paying little attention human suffering caused
marlin explains ellul propaganda founded governing myths society
these include myths work happiness nation youth hero
ellul sees such myths pre-propaganda because lay groundwork active propaganda campaigns
marlin points out ellul's concept sociological propaganda similar also provides basis overt propaganda campaigns
writes notion american way life example provides sociological backdrop active propaganda
once accepts american way life superior becomes criterion good evil things un-american become evil marlin writes
aside ellul's work propaganda technology marlin also written appreciatively french thinker's theological studies
1986 review ellul's money power example concludes contains wealth insight adding [a]s roman catholics much learn relearn book
marlin notes ellul's belief money predisposes people neglect their primary obligation toward god
real question marlin writes whether wealth prospect attaining dominant force our lives
any time subordinate human considerations narrow economic exchange relationships --- ignoring fact cost-savings programmes cause widespread unemployment example --- reveal preoccupation wrong standpoint
our heart after wrong treasure
