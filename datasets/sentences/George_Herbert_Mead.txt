pragmatism symbolic interaction pragmatic philosophers like mead focus development self objectivity world within social realm individual mind exist relation other minds shared meanings mead 1982 5
two most important roots mead's work symbolic interactionism general philosophy pragmatism social opposed psychological behaviorism
mead concerned stimuli gestures social objects rich meanings rather bare physical objects psychological behaviourists considered stimuli
pragmatism wide ranging philosophical position several aspects mead's influences identified
there four main tenets pragmatism see internet encyclopedia philosophy first pragmatists true reality does exist out there real world actively created act toward world
second people remember base their knowledge world useful them likely alter no longer works
third people define social physical objects encounter world according their use them
lastly want understand actors must base understanding people actually
three these ideas critical symbolic interactionism focus interaction actor world view both actor world dynamic processes static structures actor's ability interpret social world
thus mead symbolic interactionists consciousness separated action interaction integral part both
mead's theories part based pragmatism behaviorism transmitted many graduate students university chicago then went establish symbolic interactionism
347–350 social philosophy behaviorism mead very important figure 20 th century social philosophy
most influential ideas emergence mind self communication process organisms discussed mind self society also known social behaviorism
concept how mind self emerge social process communication signs founded symbolic interactionist school sociology
rooted intellectually hegelian dialectics process philosophy mead like dewey developed materialist process philosophy based upon human action specifically communicative action
human activity pragmatic sense criterion truth through human activity meaning made
joint activity including communicative activity means through our sense self constituted
essence mead's social behaviorism mind substance located transcendent realm nor merely series events takes place within human physiological structure
approach opposed traditional view mind separate body
emergence mind contingent upon interaction human organism social environment through participation social act communication individuals realize their potential significantly symbolic behavior thought
mind mead’s terms individualized focus communication process
linguistic behavior part individual
there then no “mind thought without language” language content mind “is development product social interaction” mind self society 191-192
thus mind reducible neurophysiology organic individual emergent “the dynamic ongoing social process” constitutes human experience mind self society 7
mead mind arises out social act communication
mead’s concept social act relevant theory mind facets social philosophy
theory “mind self society” effect philosophy act standpoint social process involving interaction many individuals just theory knowledge value philosophy act standpoint experiencing individual interaction environment
action very important social theory according mead actions also occur within communicative process
initial phase act constitutes gesture
gesture preparatory movement enables other individuals become aware intentions given organism
rudimentary situation conversation gestures gesture part first individual evokes preparatory movement part second gesture second organism turn calls out response first person
level no communication occurs
neither organism aware effect own gestures upon other gestures nonsignificant
communication take place each organism must knowledge how other individual will respond own ongoing act
here gestures significant symbols
significant symbol kind gesture humans make
gestures become significant symbols arouse individual making them same kind response supposed elicit those whom gestures addressed
significant symbols truly communication
356–357 mead grounded human perception action-nexus joas 1985 148
perceive world terms “means living” mead 1982 120
perceive food perceive eating
perceive house perceive shelter
say perception terms action
mead's theory perception similar j
mead social psychologist argued tune durkheim individual product ongoing preexisting society specifically social interaction consequence sui generis society
self arises individual becomes object themselves
mead argued objects first other people secondarily become objects ourselves taking perspective other people
language enables us talk ourselves same way talk other people thus through language become other ourselves
joint activity mead called 'social acts' humans learn see themselves standpoint their co-actors
central mechanism within social act enables perspective taking position exchange
people within social act often alternate social positions e
giving/receiving asking/helping winning/losing hiding/seeking talking/listening
children's games there repeated position exchange example hide-and-seek mead argued main ways perspective taking develops
however mead unlike john dewey j
gibson key simply human action rather social action
humans manipulatory phase act socially mediated say acting towards objects humans simultaneously take perspectives others towards object
mead means social act opposed simply act latter being deweyan concept
non-human animals also manipulate objects non-social manipulation take perspective other organisms toward object
humans other hand take perspective other actors towards objects enables complex human society subtle social coordination
social act economic exchange example both buyer seller must take each other's perspectives towards object being exchanged
seller must recognize value buyer while buyer must recognize desirability money seller
mutual perspective taking economic exchange occur mead influenced point adam smith
nature self final piece mead's social theory mind individual importation social process
previously discussed mead presented self mind terms social process
gestures taken individual organism individual organism also takes collective attitudes others form gestures reacts accordingly other organized attitudes
process characterized mead me
me social self response me
other words response individual attitudes others while me organized set attitudes others individual assumes
mead develops william james' distinction me
me accumulated understanding generalized other
how thinks one's group perceives oneself etc
individual's impulses
self subject me self object
knower me known
mind stream thought self-reflective movements interaction me
these dynamics go beyond selfhood narrow sense form basis theory human cognition
mead thinking process internalized dialogue me
mead rooted self’s “perception meaning” deeply sociologically common praxis subjects joas 1985 166 found specifically social encounters
understood combination 'i' 'me' mead’s self proves noticeably entwined within sociological existence
mead existence community comes before individual consciousness
first must participate different social positions within society subsequently use experience take perspective others thus become self-conscious
philosophy science mead major american philosopher virtue being along john dewey charles peirce william james founders pragmatism
also made significant contributions philosophies nature science history philosophical anthropology process philosophy
dewey alfred north whitehead considered mead thinker first rank
classic example social theorist whose work does fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries
far work philosophy science mead sought find psychological origin science efforts individuals attain power over their environment
notion physical object arises out manipulatory experience
there social relation inanimate objects organism takes role things manipulates directly manipulates indirectly perception
example taking introjecting imitating resistant role solid object individual obtains cognition inside nonliving things
historically concept physical object arose animistic conception universe
contact experience includes experiences position balance support these used organism creates conceptions physical world
our scientific concepts space time mass abstracted manipulatory experience
such concepts electron also derived manipulation
developing science construct hypothetical objects order assist ourselves controlling nature
conception present distinct unit experience rather process becoming disappearing scientific fiction devised facilitate exact measurement
scientific worldview immediate experience replaced theoretical constructs
ultimate experience however manipulation contact completion act
play game generalized other mead theorized human beings begin their understanding social world through play game
play comes first child's development
child takes different roles he/she observes adult society plays them out gain understanding different social roles
instance first plays role policeman then role thief while playing cops robbers plays role doctor patient playing doctor
result such play child learns become both subject object begins become able build self
however limited self because child take role distinct separate others still lack general organized sense themselves
360 next stage game stage required person develop full sense self
whereas play stage child takes role distinct others game stage child must take role everyone else involved game
furthermore these roles must definite relationship another
illustrate game stage mead gives famous example baseball game game number individuals involved then child taking role must ready take role everyone else
gets ball nine must responses each position involved own position
must know everyone else going order carry out own play
take these roles
present consciousness same time moments three four individuals present own attitude such going throw ball going catch
these responses must degree present own make-up
game then there set responses such others organized attitude calls out appropriate attitudes other
mead 1934/1962151 game stage organization begins definite personalities start emerge
children begin become able function organized groups most importantly determine will within specific group
360–361 mead calls child's first encounter generalized other main concepts mead proposes understanding emergence social self human beings
generalized other thought understanding given activity actors' place within activity perspective others engaged activity
through understanding generalized other individual understands kind behavior expected appropriate different social settings
how does perspective taking occur according mead? argued social acts such games routine forms social interaction enable perspective taking through 'position exchange'
assuming games routine social acts differentiated social positions these positions create our cognitive perspectives then might moving roles game e
hiding seeking buying selling come learn perspective other
new interpretation mead's account taking perspective other experimental support
