feyzullah's family come country near vodina now edhessa western greek macedonia
surname sofuzade meaning 'son pious man' suggests ancestors zübeyde ali rıza similar background
cemil bozok son salih bozok distant cousin atatürk later adc claims related both ali rıza's zübeyde's families
mean families atatürk's parents interrelated
cemil bozok also notes paternal grandfather safer efendi albanian origin
may bearing vexed question atatürk's ethnic origin
atatürk's parents relatives used turkish their mother tongue
suggests least their ancestors originally come turkey since local muslims albanian slav origin no ethnic connection turkey spoke albanian serbo-croat bulgarian least long remained their native land
looks ataturk resembled local albanians slavs
there no evidence either ali riza zübeyde descended such turkish nomads
page 28 much likely atatürk inherited looks balkan ancestors
albanians slavs likely figured among ancestors

ismet paşa kurumlaşma ile neyi kastettiğini de şöyle anlattıbiz cumhuriyeti kurduğumuz zaman onu yaşatıp yaşatamayacağımız en büyük sorun idi
çünkü saltanatın ve hilafetin lağvına karşı olanların sayısı çoktu ve hedefleri de cumhuriyetti
cumhuriyetin 10 yaşına bastığını görmek o yüzden önemliydi
nitekim büyük atatürk'ün emriyle 10'uncu yıl kutlamaları çok büyük bir bayram oldu
biz de cumhuriyetin ve devletin kurumlaştığını göstermeye bundan sonra hep itina ettik
