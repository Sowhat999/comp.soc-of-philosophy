variety essays books lays out key concepts such hidden possibilities things sense world much depth possibility may seem correlatively need thematize resist self-validating reduction process being part world reduced less might then very reduction taken excuse validation itself obliterated possibilities now thoroughly out view
correspondingly task knowing valuing read off nature possibility things off world given actively engage world venture trust create new kinds openings interaction world within deeper possibilities might emerge
settled modes value issue familiar ethics persons example originary areas ethics weston calls them now taking shape matter extension application pre-given principles rather co-creation co-constitution new values
environmental ethics particular weston argues stand very beginning our exploration
same time also argues multicentric approach reconstituting human relation more-than-human world opposed mono-centrism either human-centered anthropocentric larger-than-human still centered sense dimension model values determines morally counts why
another key theme centrality built lived world shaping thought well vice versa
philosophers tend assume one-way connection—that thought determines world—while philosophy's critics such doctrinaire marxists see just other way around
weston's view connection goes both ways genuinely dialectical
world set concrete practices represent enactment certain ideas also shape our ideas turn
cultural enactment perpetuation anthropocentrism good example
view good thing necessary gives thought anchor allows us work out ideas concretely gives us lever philosophical change well actually changing world
once again world somehow limit possibility
world shapes our concepts does determine them likewise our concepts shape our thought determine
upshot conceptual room move
rather analyzing concepts fixed read-offs reality reshape relocate them doing remake thought world itself
21 st century philosophical toolbox finally just ethical practice becomes intelligent creative critical engagement problematic situations possibilities rather puzzle-solving even widely taught conventional field critical thinking becomes something matter testing someone else's arguments fallacies rather constructive open-ended process framing one's own arguments energetically recasting exploring others' lines thought

criticism critics argue weston's notions originary ethics reconstructive engagement offer little no concrete guidance especially less-than-optimal situations choices nonetheless must made
though weston challenged called dilemma-ism method doing ethics expectation necessary structure ethical problems sometimes genuine dilemmas need addressed
weston's commitment opening up new possibilities may open up range problematic even disturbing possibilities well
definite defended limits seem necessary
second philosophy becomes species imagination improvisation engagement clear retains any enough distinctive professional identity
although officially weston professor philosophy entire professional life much actual teaching writing interdisciplinary settings beyond co-taught biologists ecologists now splits time philosophy environmental studies departments elon working well astronomers zen masters environmental education programs well design social change projects such hart's mill eco-village
it's unclear whether really philosopher like jack-of-all-trades made secure home philosophy departments comfortable base somewhat undisciplined adventurings
third weston's ethics textbooks particular take substantive incompletely acknowledged defended positions ethical philosophy
weston's response seems any practical textbook necessarily does
usual textbooks less troublingly substantive because substance tends taken-for-granted norms
weston's method seems try reconstruct certain fields long way around rewriting their textbooks modeling quite different approach practice therefore inviting new kinds students field perhaps also reshaping their teachers' views without arguing usual way against assumed norms
may effective just remarkably patient how philosophers usually think should proceed
