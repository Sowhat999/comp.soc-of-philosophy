analogous latin name benedictus
eudoxus's father aeschines cnidus loved watch stars night
eudoxus first travelled tarentum study archytas whom learned mathematics
while italy eudoxus visited sicily studied medicine philiston
around 387 bc age 23 traveled physician theomedon according diogenes laërtius believed lover athens study followers socrates
eventually attended lectures plato other philosophers several months due disagreement falling out
eudoxus quite poor afford apartment piraeus
attend plato's lectures walked seven miles km each direction each day
due poverty friends raised funds sufficient send heliopolis egypt pursue study astronomy mathematics
lived there 16 months
egypt then traveled north cyzicus located south shore sea marmara propontis
traveled south court mausolus
during travels gathered many students own
around 368 bc eudoxus returned athens students
according sources around 367 assumed headship academy during plato's period syracuse taught aristotle
[citation needed] eventually returned native cnidus served city assembly
while cnidus built observatory continued writing lecturing theology astronomy meteorology
son aristagoras three daughters actis philtis delphis
mathematical astronomy fame due introduction astronomical globe early contributions understanding movement planets
work proportions shows insight numbers allows rigorous treatment continuous quantities just whole numbers even rational numbers
revived tartaglia others 16 th century became basis quantitative work science century until replaced richard dedekind
craters mars moon named honor
algebraic curve kampyle eudoxus also named after a2 x4 = b4 x2 + y2
mathematics eudoxus considered greatest classical greek mathematicians antiquity second archimedes
rigorously developed antiphon's method exhaustion precursor integral calculus also used masterly way archimedes following century
applying method eudoxus proved such mathematical statements areas circles another squares their radii volumes spheres another cubes their radii volume pyramid one-third volume prism same base altitude volume cone one-third corresponding cylinder
eudoxus introduced idea non-quantified mathematical magnitude describe work continuous geometrical entities such lines angles areas volumes thereby avoiding use irrational numbers
doing reversed pythagorean emphasis number arithmetic focusing instead geometrical concepts basis rigorous mathematics
pythagoreans such eudoxus' teacher archytas believed arithmetic provide basis proofs
induced need understand operate incommensurable quantities eudoxus established may first deductive organization mathematics basis explicit axioms
change focus eudoxus stimulated divide mathematics lasted two thousand years
combination greek intellectual attitude unconcerned practical problems there followed significant retreat development techniques arithmetic algebra
pythagoreans discovered diagonal square does common unit measurement sides square famous discovery square root 2 cannot expressed ratio two integers
discovery heralded existence incommensurable quantities beyond integers rational fractions same time threw question idea measurement calculations geometry whole
example euclid provides elaborate proof pythagorean theorem elements
47 using addition areas much later elements vi
31 simpler proof similar triangles relies ratios line segments
ancient greek mathematicians calculated quantities equations today instead used proportionalities express relationship quantities
thus ratio two similar quantities just numerical value think today ratio two similar quantities primitive relationship them
eudoxus able restore confidence use proportionalities providing astounding definition meaning equality two ratios
definition proportion forms subject euclid's book v
definition 5 euclid's book v read magnitudes same ratio first second third fourth any equimultiples whatever taken first third any equimultiples whatever second fourth former equimultiples alike exceed alike equal alike fall short latter equimultiples respectively taken corresponding order
using modern-day notation clarified follows
take four quantities c then first second ratio similarly third fourth ratio
now say following any two arbitrary integers m n form equimultiples m·a m·c first third likewise form equimultiples n·b n·d second fourth
happens m·a > n·b then must also m·c > n·d
happens m·a = n·b then must also m·c = n·d
finally happens m·a < n·b then must also m·c < n·d
notice definition depends comparing similar quantities m·a n·b similar quantities m·c n·d does depend existence common unit measuring these quantities
complexity definition reflects deep conceptual methodological innovation involved
brings mind famous fifth postulate euclid concerning parallels extensive complicated wording other postulates
eudoxian definition proportionality uses quantifier every
harness infinite infinitesimal just modern epsilon-delta definitions limit continuity
additionally archimedean property stated definition 4 euclid's book v originally due archimedes eudoxus
astronomy ancient greece astronomy branch mathematics astronomers sought create geometrical models imitate appearances celestial motions
identifying astronomical work eudoxus separate category therefore modern convenience
eudoxus' astronomical texts whose names survived include disappearances sun possibly eclipses oktaeteris ὀκταετηρίς eight-year lunisolar cycle calendar phaenomena φαινόμενα entropon ἔντροπον spherical astronomy probably based observations made eudoxus egypt cnidus speeds planetary motions fairly well informed contents phaenomena eudoxus' prose text basis poem same name aratus
hipparchus quoted text eudoxus commentary aratus
eudoxan planetary models general idea content speeds gleaned aristotle's metaphysics xii commentary simplicius cilicia 6 th century ad de caelo another work aristotle
according story reported simplicius plato posed question greek astronomers assumption uniform orderly motions apparent motions planets accounted for? quoted lloyd 1970 p
plato proposed seemingly chaotic wandering motions planets explained combinations uniform circular motions centered spherical earth apparently novel idea 4 th century bc
most modern reconstructions eudoxan model moon assigned three spheres outermost rotates westward once 24 hours explaining rising setting
second rotates eastward once month explaining monthly motion moon through zodiac
third also completes revolution month axis tilted slightly different angle explaining motion latitude deviation ecliptic motion lunar nodes
sun also assigned three spheres
second completes motion year instead month
inclusion third sphere implies eudoxus mistakenly believed sun motion latitude
five visible planets venus mercury mars jupiter saturn assigned four spheres each outermost explains daily motion
second explains planet's motion through zodiac
third fourth together explain retrogradation planet appears slow down then briefly reverse motion through zodiac
inclining axes two spheres respect each other rotating them opposite directions equal periods eudoxus make point inner sphere trace out figure-eight shape hippopede
importance eudoxan system callippus greek astronomer 4 th century added seven spheres eudoxus' original 27 addition planetary spheres eudoxus included sphere fixed stars
aristotle described both systems insisted adding unrolling spheres each set spheres cancel motions outer set
aristotle concerned physical nature system without unrollers outer motions transferred inner planets
major flaw eudoxan system inability explain changes brightness planets seen earth
because spheres concentric planets will remain same distance earth
problem pointed out antiquity autolycus pitane
astronomers responded introducing deferent epicycle caused planet vary distance
however eudoxus' importance greek astronomy considerable first attempt mathematical explanation planets
ethics aristotle nicomachean ethics attributes eudoxus argument favor hedonism pleasure ultimate good activity strives
according aristotle eudoxus put forward following arguments position things rational irrational aim pleasure things aim believe good good indication chief good thing most things aim
similarly pleasure's opposite − pain − universally avoided provides additional support idea pleasure universally considered good
people don't seek pleasure means something else end own right
any other good you think better pleasure added good good increased
things good happiness peculiar being praised may show crowning good
