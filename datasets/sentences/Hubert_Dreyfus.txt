dreyfus' criticism ai main article dreyfus' critique artificial intelligence dreyfus' critique artificial intelligence ai concerns considers four primary assumptions ai research
first two assumptions calls biological psychological assumptions
biological assumption brain analogous computer hardware mind analogous computer software
psychological assumption mind works performing discrete computations form algorithmic rules discrete representations symbols
dreyfus claims plausibility psychological assumption rests two others epistemological ontological assumptions
epistemological assumption activity either animate inanimate objects formalised mathematically form predictive rules laws
ontological assumption reality consists entirely set mutually independent atomic indivisible facts
it's because epistemological assumption workers field argue intelligence same formal rule-following it's because ontological argue human knowledge consists entirely internal representations reality
basis these two assumptions workers field claim cognition manipulation internal symbols internal rules therefore human behaviour large extent context free see contextualism
therefore truly scientific psychology possible will detail 'internal' rules human mind same way laws physics detail 'external' laws physical world
key assumption dreyfus denies
other words argues cannot now never will able understand our own behavior same way understand objects example physics chemistry considering ourselves things whose behaviour predicted via 'objective' context free scientific laws
according dreyfus context-free psychology contradiction terms
dreyfus's arguments against position taken phenomenological hermeneutical tradition especially work martin heidegger
heidegger argued contrary cognitivist views ai based our being fact highly context-bound why two context-free assumptions false
dreyfus doesn't deny choose see human any activity being 'law-governed' same way choose see reality consisting indivisible atomic facts
huge leap state because want see things way therefore objective fact case
fact dreyfus argues necessarily case therefore any research program assumes will quickly run profound theoretical practical problems
therefore current efforts workers field doomed failure
although dreyfus reputation luddite quarters[according whom?] doesn't believe ai fundamentally impossible rather current research program fatally flawed[citation needed]
argues get device devices human-like intelligence require them human-like being-in-the-world bodies less like ours social acculturation
society less like ours
