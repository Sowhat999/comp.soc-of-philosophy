ens durkheim studied under direction numa denis fustel de coulanges classicist social scientific outlook latin dissertation montesquieu
same time read auguste comte herbert spencer
thus durkheim became interested scientific approach society very early career
meant first many conflicts french academic system no social science curriculum time
durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting turning attention psychology philosophy ethics eventually sociology
obtained agrégation philosophy 1882 though finishing next last graduating class owing serious illness year before
there no way man durkheim's views receive major academic appointment paris
1882 1887 taught philosophy several provincial schools
1885 decided leave germany two years studied sociology marburg berlin leipzig
durkheim indicated several essays leipzig learned appreciate value empiricism language concrete complex things sharp contrast abstract clear simple ideas cartesian method
1886 part doctoral dissertation completed draft division labour society working towards establishing new science sociology
academic career collection durkheim's courses origins socialism 1896 edited published nephew marcel mauss 1928 durkheim's period germany resulted publication numerous articles german social science philosophy durkheim particularly impressed work wilhelm wundt
durkheim's articles gained recognition france received teaching appointment university bordeaux 1887 teach university's first social science course
official title chargé d'un cours de science sociale et de pédagogie thus taught both pedagogy sociology latter never taught france before
appointment social scientist mostly humanistic faculty important sign change times also growing importance recognition social sciences
position durkheim helped reform french school system introduced study social science curriculum
however controversial beliefs religion morality explained terms purely social interaction earned many critics
also 1887 durkheim married louise dreyfus
two children marie andré
1890 s period remarkable creative output durkheim
1893 published division labour society doctoral dissertation fundamental statement nature human society development
durkheim's interest social phenomena spurred politics
france's defeat franco-prussian war led fall regime napoleon iii then replaced third republic
turn resulted backlash against new secular republican rule many people considered vigorously nationalistic approach necessary rejuvenate france's fading power
durkheim jew staunch supporter third republic sympathy towards socialism thus political minority situation galvanized politically

durkheim pioneers use quantitative methods criminology during suicide case study
1902 durkheim finally achieved goal attaining prominent position paris became chair education sorbonne
durkheim aimed parisian position earlier parisian faculty took longer accept called sociological imperialism admit social science their curriculum
became full professor professor science education there 1906 1913 named chair education sociology
because french universities technically institutions training secondary school teachers position gave durkheim considerable influence—his lectures ones mandatory entire student body
durkheim much influence over new generation teachers around time also served advisor ministry education
1912 published last major work elementary forms religious life
émile durkheim's grave montparnasse cemetery outbreak world war tragic effect durkheim's life
leftism patriotic rather internationalist—he sought secular rational form french life
coming war inevitable nationalist propaganda followed made difficult sustain already nuanced position

durkheim's thought throughout career durkheim concerned primarily three goals
first establish sociology new academic discipline
second analyze how societies maintain their integrity coherence modern era things such shared religious ethnic background no longer assumed end much effect laws religion education similar forces society social integration
lastly durkheim concerned practical implications scientific knowledge
importance social integration expressed throughout durkheim's work society lacks unity derives fact relationships parts exactly regulated unity resulting harmonious articulation various functions assured effective discipline addition society lacks unity based upon commitment men's wills common objective then no pile sand least jolt slightest puff will suffice scatter
— émile durkheim inspirations during university studies école durkheim influenced two neo-kantian scholars charles bernard renouvier émile boutroux
principles durkheim absorbed them included rationalism scientific study morality anti-utilitarianism secular education
methodology influenced numa denis fustel de coulanges supporter scientific method
fundamental influence durkheim's thought sociological positivism auguste comte effectively sought extend apply scientific method found natural sciences social sciences
according comte true social science should stress empirical facts well induce general scientific laws relationship among these facts
there many points durkheim agreed positivist thesis
first accepted study society founded examination facts
second like comte acknowledged valid guide objective knowledge scientific method
third agreed comte social sciences become scientific stripped their metaphysical abstractions philosophical speculation
same time durkheim believed comte still too philosophical outlook
second influence durkheim's view society beyond comte's positivism epistemological outlook called social realism
although never explicitly exposed durkheim adopted realist perspective order demonstrate existence social realities outside individual show these realities existed form objective relations society
epistemology science realism defined perspective takes central point departure view external social realities exist outer world these realities independent individual's perception them
view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such empiricism positivism
empiricists such david hume argued realities outside world products human sense perception
according empiricists realities thus merely perceived exist independently our perceptions no causal power themselves
comte's positivism went step further claiming scientific laws deduced empirical observations
going beyond durkheim claimed sociology discover apparent laws able discover inherent nature society
scholars also debate exact influence jewish thought durkheim's work
answer remains uncertain scholars argued durkheim's thought form secularized jewish thought while others argue proving existence direct influence jewish thought durkheim's achievements difficult impossible
establishing sociology durkheim authored most programmatic statements sociology how should practiced
concern establish sociology science
arguing place sociology among other sciences sociology then auxiliary any other science itself distinct autonomous science
give sociology place academic world ensure legitimate science must object clear distinct philosophy psychology own methodology
argued there every society certain group phenomena may differentiated
those studied other natural sciences
fundamental aim sociology discover structural social facts
establishment sociology independent recognized academic discipline amongst durkheim's largest most lasting legacies
within sociology work significantly influenced structuralism structural functionalism
scholars inspired durkheim include marcel mauss maurice halbwachs célestin bouglé alfred radcliffe-brown talcott parsons robert k
merton jean piaget claude lévi-strauss ferdinand de saussure michel foucault clifford geertz peter berger robert bellah social reformer patrick hunout others
methodology cover french edition rules sociological method 1919 rules sociological method 1895 durkheim expressed will establish method guarantee sociology's truly scientific character
questions raised author concerns objectivity sociologist how may study object very beginning conditions relates observer? according durkheim observation must impartial impersonal possible even though perfectly objective observation sense may never attained
social fact must studied according relation other social facts never according individual studies
sociology should therefore privilege comparison rather study singular independent facts
durkheim sought create first rigorous scientific approaches social phenomena
along herbert spencer first people explain existence quality different parts society reference function served maintaining quotidian
how make society work
also agreed organic analogy comparing society living organism
thus work sometimes seen precursor functionalism
durkheim also insisted society sum parts
unlike contemporaries ferdinand tönnies max weber focused motivates actions individuals approach associated methodological individualism rather study social facts
social facts main article social fact social fact every way acting fixed capable exercising individual external constraint again every way acting general throughout given society while same time existing own right independent individual manifestations
— émile durkheim rules sociological method durkheim's work revolved around study social facts term coined describe phenomena existence themselves bound actions individuals coercive influence upon them
durkheim argued social facts sui generis independent existence greater objective actions individuals compose society
such social facts explain observed social phenomena
being exterior individual person social facts may thus also exercise coercive power various people composing society sometimes observed case formal laws regulations also situations implying presence informal rules such religious rituals family norms
unlike facts studied natural sciences social fact thus refers specific category phenomena determining cause social fact must sought among antecedent social facts among states individual consciousness
— émile durkheim rules sociological method such social facts endowed power coercion reason may control individual behaviors
according durkheim these phenomena cannot reduced biological psychological grounds
social facts material physical objects immaterial meanings sentiments etc
latter cannot seen touched external coercive such become real gain facticity
physical objects represent both material immaterial social facts example flag physical social fact often various immaterial social facts meaning importance flag attached
many social facts however no material form
even most individualistic subjective phenomena such love freedom suicide regarded durkheim objective social facts
individuals composing society directly cause suicide suicide social fact exists independently society caused other social facts such rules governing behavior group attachment whether individual likes
whether person leaves society does change anything fact society will still contain suicides
suicide like other immaterial social facts exists independently will individual cannot eliminated influential coercive physical laws such gravity
sociology's task thus consists discovering qualities characteristics such social facts discovered through quantitative experimental approach durkheim extensively relied statistics
society collective consciousness culture cover french edition division labour society regarding society itself like social institutions general durkheim saw set social facts
even society durkheim interested answering how society created holds society together
division labour society durkheim attempted answer question holds society together
assumes humans inherently egoistic norms beliefs values collective consciousness form moral basis society resulting social integration
collective consciousness key importance society requisite function without society cannot survive
collective consciousness produces society holds together same time individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions
through collective consciousness human beings become aware another social beings just animals
totality beliefs sentiments common average members society forms determinate system life own
termed collective common consciousness
— emile durkheim particular emotional part collective consciousness overrides our egoism emotionally bound culture act socially because recognize responsible moral way act
key forming society social interaction durkheim believes human beings group will inevitably act such way society formed
importance another key social fact culture
groups interacting create their own culture attach powerful emotions
first scholars consider question culture intensely
durkheim interested cultural diversity how existence diversity nonetheless fails destroy society
durkheim answered any apparent cultural diversity overridden larger common generalized cultural system law
socioevolutionary approach durkheim described evolution societies mechanical solidarity organic solidarity rising mutual need
societies become complex evolving mechanical organic solidarity division labour counteracting replacing collective consciousness
simpler societies people connected others due personal ties traditions larger modern society connected due increased reliance others regard them performing their specialized tasks needed modern highly complex society survive
mechanical solidarity people self-sufficient there little integration thus there need use force repression keep society together
also such societies people much fewer options life
organic solidarity people much integrated interdependent specialisation cooperation extensive
progress mechanical organic solidarity based first population growth increasing population density second increasing morality density development complex social interactions thirdly increasing specialisation workplace
ways mechanical organic societies differ function law mechanical society law focused punitive aspect aims reinforce cohesion community often making punishment public extreme whereas organic society law focuses repairing damage done focused individuals community
main features modern organic society importance sacredness even given concept social fact individual
individual rather collective becomes focus rights responsibilities center public private rituals holding society together function once performed religion
stress importance concept durkheim talked cult individual thus very far there being antagonism individual society often claimed moral individualism cult individual fact product society itself
society instituted made man god whose servant
— émile durkheim durkheim saw population density growth key factors evolution societies advent modernity
number people given area increase does number interactions society becomes complex
growing competition numerous people also leads further division labour
time importance state law individual increases while religion moral solidarity decreases
another example evolution culture durkheim pointed fashion although case noted cyclical phenomenon
according durkheim fashion serves differentiate lower classes upper classes because lower classes want look like upper classes will eventually adapt upper class fashion depreciating forcing upper class adopt new fashion
social pathologies crime society durkheim noted there several possible pathologies lead breakdown social integration disintegration society two most important ones anomie forced division labour lesser ones include lack coordination suicide
anomie durkheim means state too rapid population growth reduces amount interaction various groups turn leads breakdown understanding norms values
forced division labour durkheim means situation power holders driven their desire profit greed results people doing work unsuited
such people unhappy their desire change system destabilize society
durkheim's views crime departure conventional notions
believed crime bound up fundamental conditions social life serves social function
stated crime implies way remains open necessary changes certain cases directly prepares these changes
examining trial socrates argues crime namely independence thought rendered service humanity country served prepare new morality faith athenians needed
such crime useful prelude reforms
sense saw crime being able release certain social tensions cleansing purging effect society
further stated authority moral conscience enjoys must excessive otherwise no-one dare criticize too easily congeal immutable form
make progress individual originality must able express itself
[even] originality criminal
shall also possible
suicide main article suicide book suicide 1897 durkheim explores differing suicide rates among protestants catholics arguing stronger social control among catholics results lower suicide rates
according durkheim catholic society normal levels integration while protestant society low levels
overall durkheim treated suicide social fact explaining variations rate macro level considering society-scale phenomena such lack connections people group attachment lack regulations behavior rather individuals' feelings motivations
study extensively discussed later scholars several major criticisms emerged
first durkheim took most data earlier researchers notably adolph wagner henry morselli much careful generalizing their own data
second later researchers found protestant–catholic differences suicide seemed limited german-speaking europe thus may spurious reflection other factors
durkheim's study suicide criticized example logical error termed ecological fallacy
however diverging views contested whether durkheim's work really contained ecological fallacy
recent authors such berk 2006 also questioned micro–macro relations underlying durkheim's work
such inkeles 1959 johnson 1965 gibbs 1968 claimed durkheim's intent explain suicide sociologically within holistic perspective emphasizing intended theory explain variation among social environments incidence suicide suicides particular individuals
despite limitations durkheim's work suicide influenced proponents control theory often mentioned classic sociological study
book pioneered modern social research served distinguish social science psychology political philosophy
religion elementary forms religious life durkheim's first purpose identify social origin function religion felt religion source camaraderie solidarity
second purpose identify links certain religions different cultures finding common denominator
wanted understand empirical social aspect religion common religions goes beyond concepts spirituality god
durkheim defined religion religion unified system beliefs practices relative sacred things
things set apart forbidden--beliefs practices unite single moral community called church those adhere them
— émile durkheim elementary forms religious life book ch
definition durkheim avoids references supernatural god
durkheim argued concept supernatural relatively new tied development science separation supernatural—that cannot rationally explained—from natural
thus according durkheim early humans everything supernatural
similarly points out religions give little importance concept god exist such buddhism four noble truths much important any individual deity
durkheim argues left following three concepts sacred ideas cannot properly explained inspire awe considered worthy spiritual respect devotion beliefs practices create highly emotional state—collective effervescence—and invest symbols sacred importance moral community group people sharing common moral philosophy
out those three concepts durkheim focused sacred noting very core religion
defined sacred things
simply collective ideals fixed themselves material objects
collective forces hypostasized say moral forces made up ideas sentiments awakened us spectacle society sensations coming physical world
— émile durkheim durkheim saw religion most fundamental social institution humankind gave rise other social forms
religion gave humanity strongest sense collective consciousness
durkheim saw religion force emerged early hunter gatherer societies emotions collective effervescence run high growing groups forcing them act new ways giving them sense hidden force driving them
over time emotions became symbolized interactions ritualized religion became organized giving rise division sacred profane
however durkheim also believed religion becoming less important being gradually superseded science cult individual
thus there something eternal religion destined outlive succession particular symbols religious thought clothed itself
— émile durkheim however even religion losing importance durkheim still laid foundation modern society interactions governed
despite advent alternative forces durkheim argued no replacement force religion yet created
expressed doubt modernity seeing modern times period transition moral mediocrity
durkheim also argued our primary categories understanding world their origins religion
religion durkheim writes gave rise most other social constructs including larger society
durkheim argued categories produced society thus collective creations
thus people create societies also create categories same time unconsciously categories prior any individual's experience
way durkheim attempted bridge divide seeing categories constructed out human experience logically prior experience
our understanding world shaped social facts example notion time defined being measured through calendar turn created allow us keep track our social gatherings rituals those turn their most basic level originated religion
end even most logical rational pursuit science trace origins religion
durkheim states religion gave birth essential society
work durkheim focused totemism religion aboriginal australians native americans
durkheim saw totemism most ancient religion focused believed simplicity ease discussion essential elements religion
durkheim's work religion criticized both empirical theoretical grounds specialists field
most important critique came durkheim's contemporary arnold van gennep expert religion ritual also australian belief systems
van gennep argued durkheim's views primitive peoples simple societies entirely erroneous
van gennep further argued durkheim demonstrated lack critical stance towards sources collected traders priests naively accepting their veracity durkheim interpreted freely dubious data
conceptual level van gennep pointed out durkheim's tendency press ethnography prefabricated theoretical scheme
despite such critiques durkheim's work religion widely praised theoretical insight whose arguments propositions according robert alun jones stimulated interest excitement several generations sociologists irrespective theoretical 'school' field specialization
sociology philosophy sociology knowledge while durkheim's work deals number subjects including suicide family social structures social institutions large part work deals sociology knowledge
while publishing short articles subject earlier career example essay de quelques formes primitives de classification written 1902 marcel mauss durkheim's definitive statement concerning sociology knowledge comes 1912 magnum opus elementary forms religious life
book goal elucidation social origins function religion also social origins impact society language logical thought
durkheim worked largely out kantian framework sought understand how concepts categories logical thought arise out social life
argued example categories space time priori
rather category space depends society's social grouping geographical use space group's social rythme determines our understanding time
durkheim sought combine elements rationalism empiricism arguing certain aspects logical thought common humans exist products collective life thus contradicting tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories acquired individual experience alone universal priori's kant argued since content categories differed society society
another key elements durkheim's theory knowledge concept représentations collectives collective representations outlined elementary forms religious life
représentations collectives symbols images come represent ideas beliefs values elaborated collectivity reducible individual constituents
include words slogans ideas any number material items serve symbol such cross rock temple feather etc
durkheim elaborates représentations collectives created through intense social interaction products collective activity
such these representations particular somewhat contradictory aspect exist externally individual since created controlled individual society whole yet simultaneously within each individual society virtue individual's participation within society
arguably most important représentation collective language according durkheim product collective action
because language collective action language contains within history accumulated knowledge experience no individual capable creating their own
durkheim says 'représentations collectives' language particular add learn our own personal experience wisdom science group accumulated course centuries
thinking concepts merely seeing reality most general side projecting light upon sensation illuminates penetrates transforms
such language social product literally structures shapes our experience reality
discursive approach language society developed later french philosophers such michel foucault
morality durkheim defines morality system rules conduct
analysis morality strongly marked immanuel kant notion duty
while durkheim influenced kant highly critical aspects latter's moral theory developed own positions
durkheim agrees kant within morality there element obligation moral authority manifesting itself certain precepts particularly important confers upon [moral rules] obligatory character
morality tells us how act position superiority
there exists certain pre-established moral norm must conform
through view durkheim makes first critique kant saying moral duties originate society found universal moral concept such categorical imperative
durkheim also argues morality characterized just obligation also something desired individual
individual believes adhering morality serving common good reason individual submits voluntarily moral commandment
however order accomplish aims morality must legitimate eyes those whom speaks
durkheim argues moral authority primarily located religion why any religion finds code morality
durkheim society resources respect power cultivate within individual both obligatory desirous aspects morality
death durkheim died paris 15 november 1917
buried cimetière de montparnasse paris
influences legacy durkheim important impact development anthropology sociology influencing thinkers school sociology such marcel mauss also later thinkers such maurice halbwachs talcott parsons alfred radcliffe-brown claude levi-strauss
recently durkheim influenced sociologists such steven lukes robert bellah pierre bourdieu
description collective consciousness also deeply influenced turkish nationalism ziya gökalp founding father turkish sociology
outside sociology influenced philosophers henri bergson emmanuel levinas ideas found latently work certain structuralist thinkers 60 s such alain badiou louis althusser michel foucault
recently durkheim influenced philosophers such charles taylor hans joas
[citation needed] durkheim contra searle much durkheim's work however remains unacknowledged philosophy despite direct relevance
proof look john searle book construction social reality elaborates theory social facts collective representations believed landmark work bridge gap analytic continental philosophy
neil gross however demonstrates how searle's views society less reconstitution durkheim's theories social facts social institutions collective representations like
searle's ideas thus open same criticisms durkheim's
searle responded saying durkheim's work worse originally believed admitting read much durkheim's work because durkheim’s account seemed impoverished read any further work
stephen lukes however responded searle's response gross refutes point point allegations searle makes against durkheim essentially upholding argument gross searle's work bears great resemblance durkheim's
lukes attributes searle's miscomprehension durkheim's work fact searle quite simply never read durkheim
