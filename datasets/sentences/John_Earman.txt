absolute positions
hole argument offered john earman powerful argument against manifold substantialism
technical mathematical argument paraphrased follows define function identity function over elements over manifold excepting small neighbourhood topology belonging
over comes differ identity smooth function
use function construct two mathematical models second generated applying proper elements first such two models identical prior time time function created foliation spacetime differ after
these considerations show since substantialism allows construction holes universe must view indeterministic
earman argues case against substantialism case determinism indeterminism should question physics our commitment substantialism
