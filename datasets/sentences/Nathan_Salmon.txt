salmon maintains co-designative proper names inter-substitutable preservation semantic content
thus view sentence samuel clemens witty expresses exactly same content mark twain witty whether competent user these sentences recognizes
therefore person believes mark twain witty ipso facto believes samuel clemens witty even she also believes inconsistently clemens witty
salmon argues made palatable recognizing believe proposition cognitively disposed particular manner toward proposition taking means proposition-guise other may disposed relative proposition-guise while being disposed relative another
salmon applies apparatus solve variety famous philosophical puzzles including frege's puzzle kripke's puzzle so-called de dicto belief w
quine's puzzle de re belief
example quine describes scenario ralph believes ortcutt no spy yet ralph also believes man brown hat spy unbeknownst ralph man hat none other ortcutt
under these circumstances ortcutt believed ralph spy? grounds affirmative negative judgment seem equally balanced
salmon's account ortcutt believed ralph spy since ralph appropriately cognitively disposed toward proposition ortcutt spy taking proposition means proposition-guise even though ralph disposed relative alternative equally relevant proposition-guise
existence salmon provided direct-reference accounts problems nonexistence names fiction
salmon argues directly contrary immanuel kant existence property particular individuals other individuals lack
according salmon english verb exist along literal tranlsations other languages among other things term alleged property sentence form exists true subject term designates something property false does exist true subject term designates something complementary property nonexistence
thus russell's example present king france exists neither true nor false since france presently monarchy therefore present king france does designate whereas napoleon exists simply false since although napoleon once existed moment died took property nonexistence
contrast salmon maintains sherlock holmes exists literally true whereas sherlock holmes detective literally false
according salmon sherlock holmes abstract entity created author arthur conan doyle fiction story collection stories very character literally false
holmes really exists depicted detective fiction
fiction holmes detective reality holmes merely fictional detective
salmon extends view calls mythical objects like hypothetical planet vulcan
vulcan really exists real planet
abstract entity depicted planet myth
salmon's account fiction myth thus direct application philosophy religion
salmon also applied account mythical objects peter geach's famous problem uncovering logical form particular sentence hob thinks witch blighted bob's mare nob wonders whether she same witch killed cob's sow
salmon's account shows how problematic sentence true even though there no witches even hob nob know each other there no whom think witch
salmon thinks again contrary kant perfectly legitimate invoke existence term's definition
thus god might legitimately defined conceivable individual divine also exists
according salmon ontological argument god's existence fallaciously assumes f f truth logic analytic truth
true logic significantly weaker variant anything uniquely f then f f
strongest conclusion validly follows proposed definition any conceivable individual actually uniquely both divine existent then god actually exists
same conclusion also trivial logical consequence atheist's contention no conceivable individual actually uniquely both divine existent
according salmon's critique ontological argument thus shows nothing
semantics pragmatics salmon argues natural-language sentences representable λ-converts another sense church's lambda-calculus although logically equivalent λ-conversion typically strictly synonymous
typically differ semantic content—as example large also seaworthy thing both large seaworthy
salmon maintains sharp division semantics pragmatics speech acts
argues uttering sentence speaker typically asserts good deal words' semantic content consequently mistake identify semantic content sentence speaker
salmon maintains such identification instance mistaken form argument philosophy language pragmatic fallacy
essentialism salmon also known metaphysics among other things analysis arguments essentialism—the doctrine properties things properties those things fail except perhaps existing
particular salmon known development defense reductio ad absurdum argument using sorites-like problem slippery slope against nearly universally accepted modal logic systems s4 s5 argues commit fallacy necessity iteration sanctioning invalid inference observation proposition p necessary truth conclusion necessary truth p necessary truth
defends view exposing mistake standard argument favoring s5 while arguing there possible worlds—thought maximal scenarios might obtained—but addition classically consistent impossible worlds maximal scenarios obtain
identity salmon also provided controversial reductio ad absurdum disproof indeterminate identity
philosophically popular idea pairs things there no fact matter concerning whether those things very same
salmon argues there such pair things x then pair different reflexive pair x itself since there fact concerning whether x x same
then follow set theory x same case there fact matter after concerning whether x same
therefore there cannot pair things there no fact concerning their identity
other hand salmon maintains vagueness due language indeterminacy results how things themselves
things attributes independently language there no fact matter concerning whether those things those attributes
critics salmon's alleged proof acknowledge highlighted difference <x y> <x x>—that there fact whether elements latter former same thing—is genuine respond does validly support conclusion those pairs same
other hand there no argument criticism salmon frege' identity
