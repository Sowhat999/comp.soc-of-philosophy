she trained psychoanalysis earned her degree 1979
ways her work seen trying adapt psychoanalytic approach poststructuralist criticism
example her view subject construction shares similarities sigmund freud lacan
however kristeva rejects any understanding subject structuralist sense instead she favors subject process trial
way she contributes poststructuralist critique essentialized structures whilst preserving teachings psychoanalysis
she travelled china 1970 s later chinese women 1977
semiotic kristeva's most important contributions signification composed two elements symbolic semiotic latter being distinct discipline semiotics founded ferdinand de saussure
explained history women philosophy augustine perumalil kristeva's semiotic closely related infantile pre-oedipal referred works freud otto rank melanie klein british object relation psychoanalysis lacan's pre-mirror stage
emotional field tied instincts dwells fissures prosody language rather denotative meanings words
furthermore according birgit schippers' 2011 book julia kristeva feminist thought semiotic realm associated musical poetic rhythmic lacks structure meaning
closely tied feminine represents undifferentiated state pre-mirror stage infant
upon entering mirror stage child learns distinguish self other enters realm shared cultural meaning known symbolic
desire language 1980 kristeva describes symbolic space development language allows child become speaking subject develop sense identity separate mother
process separation known abjection whereby child must reject move away mother order enter world language culture meaning social
realm language called symbolic contrasted semiotic associated masculine law structure
kristeva departs lacan idea even after entering symbolic subject continues oscillate semiotic symbolic
therefore rather arriving fixed identity subject permanently process
because female children continue identify degree mother figure especially likely retain close connection semiotic
continued identification mother may result kristeva refers black sun 1989 melancholia depression given female children simultaneously reject identify mother figure
also suggested e
creed 1993 degradation women women's bodies popular culture particularly example slasher films emerges because threat identity mother's body poses reminder time spent undifferentiated state semiotic no concept self identity
after abjecting mother subjects retain unconscious fascination semiotic desiring reunite mother while same time fearing loss identity accompanies
slasher film thus provide way audience members safely reenact process abjection vicariously expelling destroying mother figure
kristeva also known her adoption plato’s idea chora meaning “a nourishing maternal space” schippers 2011
kristeva’s idea chora interpreted several ways reference uterus metaphor relationship mother child temporal period preceding mirror stage
her essay motherhood according giovanni bellini desire language 1980 kristeva refers chora “non-expressive totality formed drives their stases motility full movement regulated
she goes suggest mother's body mediates chora symbolic realm mother access culture meaning yet also forms totalizing bond child
kristeva also noted her work concept intertextuality
anthropology psychology kristeva argues anthropology psychology connection social subject represent each other rather follow same logic survival group subject
furthermore her analysis oedipus she claims speaking subject cannot exist his/her own he/she stands fragile threshold stranded account impossible demarcation powers horror p
her comparison two disciplines kristeva claims way individual excludes abject mother means forming identity same way societies constructed
broader scale cultures exclude maternal feminine come being
[clarification needed] feminist kristeva regarded key proponent french feminism together simone de beauvoir hélène cixous luce irigaray
kristeva remarkable influence feminism feminist literary studies us uk well readings contemporary art although her relation feminist circles movements france quite controversial
kristeva made famous disambiguation three types feminism women's time new maladies soul 1993 while rejecting first two types including beauvoir her stands sometimes considered rejecting feminism altogether
kristeva proposed idea multiple sexual identities against joined code [clarification needed] unified feminine language
denunciation identity politics kristeva argues her writings misunderstood american feminist academics
kristeva's view enough simply dissect structure language order find hidden meaning
language should also viewed through prisms history individual psychic sexual experiences
post-structuralist approach enabled specific social groups trace source their oppression very language used
however kristeva believes harmful posit collective identity above individual identity political assertion sexual ethnic religious identities ultimately totalitarian
novelist kristeva number novels resemble detective stories
while books maintain narrative suspense develop stylized surface her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic her theoretical projects
her characters reveal themselves mainly through psychological devices making her type fiction mostly resemble later work dostoevsky
