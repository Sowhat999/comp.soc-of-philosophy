philosophical ideas existentialism according mulla sadra existence precedes essence thus principal since something exist first then essence
notable mulla sadra question specifically applied god god's position universe especially context reconciling god's position qur'an verses cosmological philosophies islam's golden era
mulla sadra metaphysics gave priority ab initio existence over quiddity
say essences determined variable according existential intensity use henry corbin's definition such essences immutable
advantage schema acceptable fundamental statements qur'an even does necessarily debilitate any previous islamic philosopher's aristotelian platonic foundations
indeed mulla sadra provides immutability god while intrinsically linking essence existence each other god's power over existence
doing mulla sadra simultaneously provided god's authority over things while also solving problem god's knowledge particulars including those evil without being inherently responsible them — even god's authority over existence existences provide framework evil exist
clever solution provides freedom will god's supremacy infiniteness god's knowledge existence evil definition existence essence leaves two inextricably linked insofar man concerned fundamentally separate insofar god concerned
perhaps most importantly primacy existence solution provides capacity god's judgement without god being directly indirectly affected evil being judged
god does need possess sin know sin god able judge intensity sin god perceives existence
result existentialism unity intellect intelligible arabic ittihad al-aaqil wa l-maqul
henry corbin describes levels modes being perception governed same law unity level intelligible world unity intellection intelligizing subject form intelligized — same unity love lover beloved
within perspective perceive sadra meant unitive union human soul supreme awareness acts knowledge active intelligence holy spirit
never question arithmetical unity intelligible unity permitting reciprocity allows us understand soul metamorphoses form—or idea—intelligized active intelligence form intelligizes itself result active intelligence holy spirit intelligizes itself soul's act intellection
reciprocally soul form intelligizing itself intelligizes itself form intelligized active intelligence
substantial motion another central concept mulla sadra's philosophy theory substantial motion arabical-harakat al-jawhariyyah based premise everything order nature including celestial spheres undergoes substantial change transformation result self-flow fayd penetration being sarayan al-wujud gives every concrete individual entity share being
contrast aristotle avicenna accepted change four categories
quantity kamm quality kayf position wad’ place ‘ayn sadra defines change all-pervasive reality running through entire cosmos including category substance jawhar
existence reality mulla sadra held view reality existence
believed essence itself general notion therefore does reality exist
paraphrase fazlur rahman mulla sadra's existential cosmology existence reality
existence reality therefore identical
existence all-comprehensive reality there nothing outside
essences negative require sort reality therefore exist
existence therefore cannot denied
therefore existence cannot negated
existence cannot negated self-evident existence god
god should searched realm existence basis existence
should noted reality arabic al-haq stated qur'an names god
paraphrase mulla sadra's logical proof god there being being perfection beyond perfection god perfect perfection existence existence singular simple reality singular reality graded intensity scale perfection scale must limit point point greatest intensity greatest existence therefore god exists causation sadra argued contingent beings require cause puts their balance existence non-existence favor former nothing come existence without cause
since world therefore contingent upon first act must god exist god must also responsible first act creation
sadra also believed causal regress impossible because causal chain work matter beginning middle end pure cause beginning 2 pure effect end 3 nexus cause effect causal nexus mulla sadra form existential ontology within cosmological framework islam supported
mulla sadra causal end pure corresponding beginning instructively places god both beginning end creative act
god's capacity measure intensity existential reality measuring causal dynamics' their relationship their origin opposed knowing their effects provided islamically-acceptable framework god's judgement reality without being tainted particulars
ingenious solution question haunted islamic philosophy almost thousand years how god able judge sin without knowing sin? truth mulla sadra true statement statement true concrete facts existence
held metaphysical formal idea truth claiming world consists mind-independent objects true truth rationally acceptable within certain theory description
mulla sadra's view cannot access reality being linguistic analysis available
theory truth two levels claim proposition true corresponds things reality proposition true conforms actual thing itself
