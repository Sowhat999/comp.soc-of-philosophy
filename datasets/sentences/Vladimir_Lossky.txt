genius eastern mystical theology lay contended apophatic character defined understanding god radically unknowable human thus philosophical terms
consequently god's special revelation scripture must preserved integrity means distinction ineffable divine essence inaccessible nature holy trinity hand positive revelation trinitarian energies other
speak trinity itself lossky confessing our poor defective human language mode existence father son holy spirit sole god cannot trinity because living god revelation though unknowable made himself known through incarnation son received holy spirit proceeds father sent world name incarnate son
trinitarian processions revelation thus produce energies human beings experience grace sanctified deified
mystical theology argued theologians undivided church understood theosis above knowledge gnosis
further clarified work vision god theoria
both works lossky also stresses differences christian thinkers such saint dionysius areopagite such thinkers plotinus neoplatonists asserting christianity neoplatonism though share common culture concepts very different understandings god ontology
