using mastery quran innovative subject-based approach quranic exegesis al-sadr extracted two concepts holy text relation governance khilafat al-insan man heir trustee god shahadat al-anbiya prophets witnesses
al-sadr explained throughout history there '…two lines
man’s line prophet’s line
former khalifa trustee inherits earth god latter shahid witness
al-sadr demonstrated khilafa governance ‘a right given whole humanity’ explained obligation given god human race ‘tend globe administer human affairs’
major advancement islamic political theory
while al-sadr identified khilafa obligation right people used broad-based exegesis quranic verse identify held responsibility shahada islamic state first prophets anbiya’ second imams considered divine rabbani continuation prophets line lastly marja’iyya see marja
while two functions khilafa governance shahada witness supervision united during times prophets two diverged during occultation khilafa returned people umma shahada scholars
