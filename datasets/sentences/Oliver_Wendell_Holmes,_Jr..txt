noteworthy rulings otis v
parker beginning first opinion court otis v
parker holmes declared due process law fundamental principle fairness protected people unreasonable legislation limited those fundamental principles enshrined common law protect most economic interests
version article influenced holmes's abrams dissent schenck v
united states series opinions surrounding wwi espionage act 1917 sedition act 1918 held freedom expression guaranteed federal state constitutions simply declared common-law privilege speech press even those expressions caused injury privilege defeated showing malice intent harm
holmes came write three unanimous opinions supreme court arose prosecutions under 1917 espionage act because earlier case baltzer v
united states circulated powerfully expressed dissent majority voted uphold conviction immigrant socialists circulated petition criticizing draft
apparently learning likely publish dissent government perhaps alerted justice louis
brandeis newly appointed president woodrow wilson abandoned case dismissed court
chief justice then asked holmes write opinions unanimous upholding convictions three similar cases there jury findings speeches leaflets published intent obstruct draft crime under 1917 law
although there no evidence attempts succeeded holmes held unanimous court attempt purely language prosecuted cases expression circumstances uttered posed clear present danger causing harm legislature properly forbidden
schenck v
united states holmes announced doctrine unanimous court famously declaring first amendment understood provide absolute right protect person falsely shouting fire theater causing panic
although much criticized schenck remains important precedent still governs cases expressions intended cause harm threaten cause imminent lawless action
abrams v
united states later year however abrams v
united states holmes again dissent
wilson administration vigorously prosecuting those suspected sympathies recent russian revolution well opponents war against germany
defendants case socialists anarchists recent immigrants russia opposed apparent efforts united states intervene russian civil war
charged violations 1918 amendments espionage act known sedition act 1918 purported make criticisms government war effort crime
abrams co-defendants charged distributing leaflets yiddish called general strike protest us intervention russia
majority court voted uphold convictions sentences ten twenty years followed deportation
holmes moved dissent
majority claimed following precedents already set schenck companion cases holmes written court holmes insisted defendants' leaflets neither threatened cause any harm nor showed specific intent hinder war effort
holmes condemned wilson administration's prosecution insistence draconian sentences defendants passionate language even am technically wrong [regarding defendants' intent] enough squeezed these poor puny anonymities turn color legal litmus paper
most nominal punishment seems possibly inflicted unless defendants made suffer indictment alleges creed avow
holmes then went explain importance freedom thought democracy [w]hen men realized time upset many fighting faiths may come believe
best test truth power thought get itself accepted competition market truth ground upon their wishes safely carried out
any rate theory constitution
experiment life experiment
writing dissent holmes may influenced zechariah chafee's article freedom speech war time
chafee criticized holmes's opinion schenck failing express detail clearly common-law doctrines upon relied
abrams dissent holmes elaborate somewhat decision schenck roughly along lines chafee suggested
although holmes evidently believed adhering own precedent later commentators accused holmes inconsistency even seeking curry favor young admirers
abrams majority opinion rely clear-and-present-danger formulation schenck claiming leaflets showed necessary intent ignoring point unlikely any effect
later opinions supreme court departed line reasoning validity statute question adopting principle legislature properly declare forms speech posed clear present danger regardless circumstances uttered
holmes continued dissent

united states 1920 case silverthorne lumber co

buck v
bell 1927 holmes 8–1 majority opinion buck v
bell case upheld virginia sterilization act 1924 forced sterilization carrie buck claimed mentally defective
although later scholarship shown suit collusive[clarification needed] carrie buck probably normal intelligence record before supreme court showed she received proper hearing she represented competent guardian able press her suit federal courts
she apparently received procedures required due process law ample measure
argument made her behalf principally statute requiring sterilization institutionalized persons unconstitutional itself violation today called substantive due process
holmes repeated familiar arguments statutes struck down appeared their face reasonable basis
support argument interest public welfare outweighs interest individuals their bodily integrity argued seen once public welfare may call upon best citizens their lives
strange call upon those already sap strength state these lesser sacrifices often felt such those concerned prevent our being swamped incompetence
better world instead waiting execute degenerate offspring crime let them starve their imbecility society prevent those manifestly unfit continuing their kind
principle sustains compulsory vaccination broad enough cover cutting fallopian tubes
three generations imbeciles enough
although opinion eugenics remains controversial decision case still stands

wade support abortion rights
contrary justice blackmun quoted justify constitutional right abortion isn't unlimited
jurisprudential contributions critique formalism holmes earliest writings established lifelong belief decisions judges consciously unconsciously result-oriented reflected evolving mores class society judges drawn
holmes accordingly argued legal rules deduced through formal logic rather emerge active process human-self government
explored these theories 1881 book common law
philosophy represented departure prevailing jurisprudence time legal formalism held law orderly system rules decisions particular cases deduced
holmes sought consciously reinvent common law—to modernize tool adjusting changing nature modern life judges past done less unconsciously
classed philosophic pragmatists although pragmatism attributed law rather personal philosophy
[a] central thought notion law evolved modern societies concerned material results defendant's actions
judge's task decide two parties before bear cost injury
holmes argued evolving common law standard liability fall upon person whose conduct reflected prudence reasonable man
construction worker throws beam onto crowded street …he does act person ordinary prudence foresee likely cause death
dealt foresaw whether does fact
death caused act guilty murder
workman reasonable cause believe space below private yard everyone excluded used rubbish-heap act blameworthy homicide mere misadventure
objective standard adopted common-law judges holmes thought reflected shift community standards away condemnation person's act toward impersonal assessment value community
modern world advances made biology social sciences should allow better conscious determination results individual acts proper measure liability them
belief pronouncements science concerning social welfare although later doubted applicability law many cases accounts enthusiastic endorsement eugenics writings opinion case buck v
[citation needed] legal positivism 1881 common law holmes brought together coherent whole earlier articles lectures concerning history common law judicial decisions england united states interpreted perspective practicing lawyer
counted law lawyer judges particular cases
law state enforce through violence necessary echoes experience civil war present writings
judges decided force state brought bear judges modern world tended consult facts consequences deciding conduct punish
decisions judges viewed over time determined rules conduct legal duties bound
judges should consult any external system morality certainly system imposed deity
holmes therefore brought himself constant conflict scholars believed legal duties rested upon natural law moral order kind invoked christian theologians other philosophic idealists
believed instead men make their own laws these laws flow mysterious omnipresence sky judges independent mouthpieces infinite
49 common law brooding omnipresence sky
rather set abstract rational mathematical any way unworldly set principles holmes [t]he prophecies courts will fact nothing pretentious mean law
458 belief law properly speaking set generalizations judges done similar cases determined view constitution united states
justice u
supreme court holmes rejected argument text constitution should applied directly cases came before court statute
shared most fellow judges belief constitution carried forward principles derived common law principles continued evolve american courts
text constitution itself originally understood set rules directive courts consider body common law deciding cases arose under constitution
followed constitutional principles adopted common law evolving law itself evolved word [in constitution] crystal transparent unchanged skin living thought
