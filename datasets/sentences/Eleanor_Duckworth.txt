duckworth student colleague late 1950 s she acted english translator interpreter piaget during american lectures until death 1980
two aspects work piaget inhelder especially important duckworth 2005 pp
258–259 first basic idea assimilation every person creates meaning her own while taking any experience her own schemes structures previous understanding
second clinical interviewing clinical method engaging children talking their ideas researcher
her experience elementary science study ess curriculum development program
program consistent work piaget inhelder psychology considered milestone history science education
elementary science study tackled following main question how present material 'from without' activity 'the mind itself undergoes' valuable? duckworth 2005 p
142 constructivist defines teaching helping people learn duckworth emphasizes importance engaging learners phenomena understanding students' current understandings trying facilitate students' own thinking
central question duckworth's 2006 research over five decades continues how people learn anyone help? process investigating question she developed research method she called expanded clinical interviewing teaching/learning research critical exploration
these three phrases emerged course her research used interchangeably duckworth 2006 p
critical exploration bärbel inhelder first applied name critical exploration piaget's clinical interviewing included observing children well interviewing interacting child experimenting investigating problem set researcher
inhelder introduced method pedagogical contexts inhelder sinclair & bovet 1974 p
duckworth 2005 p
258–259 describes critical exploration having two facets curriculum development pedagogy
context critical exploration curriculum development means teacher planning how engage students' minds exploring subject matter
pedagogy constitutes practice teachers invite students express their thoughts critical exploration research method requires just much resourcefulness finding appropriate materials questions activities any good curriculum development does
whether poems mathematical situations historical documents liquids music our offerings must provide accessible entry points must present subject matter different angles elicit different responses different learners open variety paths exploration engender conflicts provide surprises must encourage learners open out beyond themselves help them realize here other points view yet uncovered yet exhausted thoughts might matter
— duckworth 2006 p
during critical exploration exploring goes two modes mode child explores subject matter other mode researcher-teacher explores child's thinking
hence teacher critical exploration finds itself nexus research teaching teacher learner support each other shorr 2007 p
369–370 critical exploration then research method two aspects developing good project child work 2 succeeding inviting child talk her ideas putting her ease being receptive answers being neutral substance answer while being encouraging fact child thinking talking getting child keep thinking problem beyond first thought comes her getting her take her thinking seriously
— duckworth 2005 p
259 consequently duckworth 2009 para
suggests classroom teacher take role researcher observing students learned while guiding students' explorations towards deeper understanding subject
teacher explores too interacting students' learning
teacher's work present engaging problems attend students' ways figuring them out helping them notice what's interesting
example teacher listens students explain their ideas asks them questions seek take students' thinking further duckworth 2006 p
main ideas teaching/learning research outlining her approach duckworth 2006 p
173 states student piaget convinced people must construct their own knowledge must assimilate new experiences ways make sense them
knew often simply telling students want them know leaves them cold
considering learning teaching critical exploration stresses following aspects students bring their prior expectations interests knowledge learning experience students' experience insights high value development their personal intelligence emerges through actions having wonderful ideas
reach deep understanding students need start their own sets ideas engaged subject matter make connection actual problem subject matter already understand
consequently students talking explain sense making while teacher listens
however requires learning culture accommodates students feeling free safe say their emerging ideas say valued duckworth meek
[b]y opening up children many fascinating aspects ordinary world enabling them feel their ideas worthwhile having following through their tendency wonderful ideas affected significant ways duckworth 2006 p
students need something complex challenges them explore students need engage phenomena study schematic substitutes
struggling complex problems every learner undergoes process constructing their own knowledge
learners experience internal cognitive conflicts believe subject matter their minds become deeply engaged problem hand
learners' efforts figuring out questions puzzles productive knowing right answer because higher order thinking processes involved
therefore teachers critical exploration value diverse efforts students make during their explorations even these efforts arrive expected answers
facilitating investigative work questions asked over over again students teachers alike example you notice? you mean? how you thinking it? why you think that? same someone else thought saw? how you figure that? how you that? how does fit she just said? you give example? responses teachers students give each other might form don't quite get
doesn't make sense me
don't really get you explain another way? hence most important students make sense understand trying out their ideas explaining them others seeing how holds up other people's their own eyes light phenomena itself duckworth 2002
teacher facilitator researcher mind-set teacher creates situations selects environmental resources get students excited engaged learning meaningful them
teacher sensitive thoughts feelings learners puts students ease engages learners invites them talk their ideas waits learners think listens then reacts substance their answers without judging them
teacher takes neutral researcher's stance
instead lecturing teacher creates situations put learners confronting their thinking processes responsible their own learning
teachers' role then asking questions like “when you say x you mean it? how work applied situation? am right understanding your idea say way?” reveal students' thinking take their own thoughts further
way teacher refrains signaling students might expect them say
instead teacher provides opportunities learners reveal their own understanding
thoughts learners become visible through responses make including actions drawings gestures constructions dialogues sound example
guiding questions teacher himself might follows duckworth 2005 p
261 lies behind response? how may other children responding it? question shall ask next experience offer next direct their attention next? students' work make sense phenomena study
teachers' work ensure safe supportive conditions classroom students take intellectual risks their work investigatively
teacher education teachers teach their students exploratively must experienced learning explorers themselves duckworth 2006
teacher education work duckworth does harvard university elsewhere she provides teachers opportunity live through think phenomena teaching learning
she involves teacher education students effort understand somebody else's understanding
she considers important teachers know their students understanding sense students making subject matter duckworth meek p
her courses harvard university she applies her teaching approach using critical exploration teach critical exploration

duckworth states her course website course starts premise there endless numbers adequate pathways people come understand subject matters
curriculum assessment must build diversity
second premise every person get involved enjoy get good every subject matter
her university teaching duckworth 2006 p
9 173–192 tries engage teacher education students three major kinds teaching learning phenomena films and/or life demonstrations two children adolescents
way teacher education students observe children/adults learning while instructors teaching engaging those learners listening understanding explanations those learners teacher education students carry out similar inquiry outside classtime meet two people their practice learners
way each teacher education student creates own trial critical exploration learners then reflects writing teacher education students learn group particular subject other teaching learning
through exploratory study group teacher education students learning same way children their classes will learning
