noddings' contributions include interpretation scientific research roots compassion altruism peaceful human relationships
nel noddings' relational ethics nel noddings' approach ethics care described relational ethics because prioritizes concern relationships
like carol gilligan noddings accepts justice based approaches supposed masculine genuine alternatives ethics care
however unlike gilligan noddings' believes caring 'rooted receptivity relatedness responsiveness' basic preferable approach ethics caring 1984 2
caring feminine approach ethics moral education key understanding noddings' ethics care understand her notion caring ethical caring particular
noddings believes mistake try provide systematic examination requirements caring nevertheless she does suggest three requirements caring caring 1984 11-12
she argues carer one-caring must exhibit engrossment motivational displacement person cared cared-for must respond way caring 1984 69
noddings' term engrossment refers thinking someone order gain greater understanding her
engrossment necessary caring because individual's personal physical situation must understood before one-caring determine appropriateness any action
'engrossment' need entail term seems suggest deep fixation other
requires attention needed come understand position other
engrossment own constitute caring someone deep understanding another person yet act against person's interests
motivational displacement prevents occurring
motivational displacement occurs one-caring's behaviour largely determined needs person whom she caring
own motivational displacement also insufficient ethical caring
example someone acted primarily desire accomplish something another person failed think carefully enough other person's needs failed correctly engrossed other fail care
finally noddings believes caring requires form recognition cared-for one-caring fact caring
there recognition response caring person cared noddings describes caring completed other 1984 4
nel noddings draws important distinction natural caring ethical caring 1984 81-83
noddings distinguishes acting because want acting because must
care someone because want care say hug friend needs hugging act love noddings claims am engaged natural caring
care someone because must care say hug acquaintance needs hugging spite my desire escape person's pain according noddings am engaged ethical caring
ethical caring occurs person acts caringly out belief caring appropriate way relating people
someone acts caring way because person naturally cares another caring ethical caring 1984 79-80
noddings' claims ethical caring based dependent natural caring 1984 83 206 fn 4
through experiencing others caring them naturally caring others people build called ethical ideal image kind person want
noddings describes wrong actions terms diminishment ethical ideal evil
person's ethical ideal diminished she either chooses forced act way rejects her internal call care
effect her image best person possible her altered way lowers her ideal
according noddings people organizations deliberately carelessly contribute diminishment other's ethical ideals
may teaching people care placing them conditions prevent them being able care 1984 116-119
person evil spite her ability otherwise she either fails personally care someone prevents others caring
noddings writes [when] intentionally rejects impulse care deliberately turns her back ethical she evil evil cannot redeemed 1984 115
referred obligation
there moments us care quite naturally
just care no ethical effort required
'want' 'ought' indistinguishable such cases
ability abstain action [so] believe anything might tend work against best interests cared-for
according noddings obligated pursue musts
criticisms noddings' relational ethics nel noddings' ethics care criticised both feminists those favour traditional allegedly masculine approaches ethics
brief feminists object caring effect carrying out traditional female role life giving while receiving little return
those accept traditional approaches ethics argue partiality shown those closest us noddings' theory inappropriate
noddings tends use unequal relationships model understanding caring
philosopher feminist sarah lucia hoagland argues relationships question such parenting teaching ideally relationships caring transitory thing designed foster independence cared-for end unequal caring relationship
unequal relationships she writes ethically problematic poor model ethical theory
hoagland argues noddings' account ethical caring one-caring placed role giver cared-for role taker
one-caring dominant choosing good cared-for gives without receiving caring return
cared-for put position being dependent insufficient control over nature caring
hoagland believes such unequal relationships cannot morally good
contributions education ethic care education education ethic care speaks obligation something right sense must something right others address us
must response induced direct encounter preparation response
respond because want either love respect those address us significant regard them
result recipients care must respond way demonstrates their caring received
regards education caring refers relationship student teacher just person cares
educators respond needs students teachers may see need design differentiated curriculum because teachers work closely students will moved their different needs interests
claim care must based time virtuous decision ongoing interest student’s welfare
needs ethic care model distinction “identifying needs education noddings 2003 provides criteria deciding whether want should recognized treated need
criteria follows want fairly stable over considerable period time and/or intense
want demonstrably connected desirable end least harmful further end impossible difficult reach without object wanted
want power within means those addressed grant
person wanting willing able contribute satisfaction want
inferred needs overt explicit curriculum education designed meet inferred needs students those identified teachers individuals improve classroom learning environment
ethics care philosophy inferred needs referred those come those directly expressing need
most needs identified educators learners inferred needs because being identified learners themselves
students’ inferred needs often identified interactively through working them observing their behaviour classroom environment
expressed needs expressed needs difficult assess address classroom environment needs directly expressed learners through behaviour words
although expressed needs difficult address educators need treat them positively order maintain caring relationship learners
expressed needs treated carefully individual might feel cared
educators should make consistent effort respond student’s expressed needs through prior planning discussions moral social issues surrounding needs basic universal needs basic needs defined most basic needs required survive such food water shelter
basic needs needs associated self-actualization overwhelming needs co-exist basic needs being compromised over extended periods time
overwhelming needs overwhelming needs cannot met usual processes schooling include extreme instances such abuse neglect illness
well student’s socioeconomic status ses dysfunctional family environment cause them come school needs cannot expressed nor met educators
help meet those overwhelming needs students particularly those poor neighborhood ethic care philosophy dictates schools should full-service institutions
medical dental care social services childcare parenting advice should available campus
turn students these situations often forced academic courses fight uphill battle engage activities difficult focus based their circumstances
implications education people poor perhaps homeless without dependable transportation cannot afford run over town seeking such services often don’t know begin
despite being aware overwhelming needs many students face force children—regardless interest aptitude—into academic courses then fight uphill battle motivate them things want
emotion professionalism teacher education emotion aggravated rise professions their insistence detachment distance cool appraisal systematic procedures
concern rational professional functioning keeps emotion out education supposed real professionals allow themselves feel controlled their emotions forced face problems dispassionate rationality noddings 1996 states teaching profession concern takes several forms fear professional judgment will impaired emotions professionals must learn protect themselves against burnout may result feeling too much one’s students become mark professionalism detached cool dispassionate use stories teacher education powerful dispelling these beliefs illustrate how deeply experienced teachers feel inevitable difficulties occur classroom educating whole child ethic care model aim education centered around happiness
incorporating component education involves helping our students understand components happiness allowing teachers students interact whole community regard education whole child noddings 2005 stated “we will find solution problems violence alienation ignorance unhappiness increasing our security imposing tests punishing schools their failure produce 100 percent proficiency demanding teachers knowledgeable subjects teach
instead must allow teachers students interact whole persons must develop policies treat school whole community
criticisms ethic care education criticism noddings' ethic care regards education advocates little importance caring oneself except means provide further care others
regards education teacher-student relationship jeopardized because educator might engage self care instead devote their energy meeting their students' needs
hoaglard p
255 states caregiver defined “martyr servant slave” philosophy ethic care
another criticism noddings' argument ethic care may result exploitation caregiver also smothering paternalism
goodin 1996 p
507 writes “the trouble subsuming individuals relationships ‘we’ness precisely then risk losing track separateness people”
well goodin 1996 p
116-120 states noddings' criteria implicit explicit needs assumes needs transparent caregiver caregiver’s perceptions privileged process interpreting needs
lastly grimshaw 1986 explains important consider good care entails element distance individuals
she states 1986 p
183 “care understanding require sort distance needed order see other projection self self continuation other”
thus clear distance self individual being cared needs exist order keep personal care both individuals mind
