biographical discrepancies there few discrepancies found current biographies hazrat babajan require due mention
firstly should noted much accepted information babajan appears established solely authority meher baba fact acknowledged dr abdul ghani munsiff 1939 first life-sketch babajan
according ghani information gleaned different sources meagre since babajan herself never communicative anyone regard her life history
facts her early life those relating her spiritual career confirmed hazrat meher baba her chief disciple spiritual chargeman khalifa
yet meher baba appears provided/endorsed two different versions babajan’s life
earliest records over decade before dr ghani’s life-sketch babajan appeared 1927 meher baba gave public talk babajan devotee recorded diary time
currently earliest account babajan’s life
people being addressed predominantly women story provide moral
summarize essentials brief talk hazrat babajan daughter then responsible chief ministers amir afghanistan kabul
early childhood she natural inclination toward spirituality realization truth
babajan fifteen years age her guardians began arrange her marriage … juncture she made bold leave family home
fifty years thereafter she led life complete resignation renunciation
after wandering place place fifty long years she last came across her master became god-realized age sixty-five
after being god-realized babajan lived time … punjab
during stay many people began respect her saint
her occasional remarks declaring herself god [ana'l-haqq am truth] upset muslim population fanatical muslim baluchi soldiers sepoys local military regiment buried babajan alive
after lapse many years during first world war baluchi regiment transferred pune city same soldiers came face-to-face babajan sitting under her neem tree char bawdi
fanaticism transformed devotion long regiment remained stationed pune soldiers came pay their respects babajan
ghani’s later extended version babajan’s life published 1939 provides different account she left home age eighteen her wedding day
eventually came contact hindu sadguru rawalpindi
later went down punjab she thirty-seven met muslim saint multan gave her god-realization
after baluchi soldiers encountered her again pune her saintly fame spread far wide she came universally known hazrat babajan
babajan’s age babajan’s alleged age she died continues controversial issue
biography variants her date birth range 1790 c
earliest birth dates provided charles purdom bhau kalchuri
purdom merely reporting opinion devotees qualified her actual date birth known supposed 1790
kalchuri dogmatic states babajan born 1790 1800 her physical presence earth lasted 130 141 years
other end scale colourful spiritual travel book search secret india 1934 then freelance journalist paul brunton recounts learnt former judge khandalawalla known [hazrat babajan] fifty years her age really ninety-five
brunton arrived india november 1930 left several months before babajan’s death september 1931
regarding brunton’s report kevin r shepherd observed khandalawalla known babajan long fifty years questionable though need doubted encountered her time her second visit bombay c
shepherd concluded general computation her age 120 years though maintained excess
purdom cited approximate date 1790 her birth though ghani view she born later
ghani’s estimate her age 125 based general reminiscences own contact her
deference critical tendencies find higher estimates indigestible there seems every ground believe subject over hundred time her death
fact babajan’s actual date birth known perhaps sufficient concede subject may well over hundred time her death
longevity spiritual accomplishment unfortunately easily become superficial hagiographic embellishment
