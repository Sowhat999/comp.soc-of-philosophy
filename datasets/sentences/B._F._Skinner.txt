controversial figure skinner depicted many different ways
widely revered bringing much-needed scientific approach study human behavior also vilified attempting apply findings based largely animal experiments human behavior real-life settings
contributions psychological theory behaviorism main articles behaviorism radical behaviorism skinner called approach study behavior radical behaviorism
philosophy behavioral science assumes behavior consequence environmental histories reinforcement see applied behavior analysis
contrast approach cognitive science behaviorism does accept private events such thinking perceptions unobservable emotions causes organism's behavior
however contrast methodological behaviorism skinner's radical behaviorism accept thoughts emotions other private events responses subject same rules overt behavior
words position stated follows felt introspectively observed nonphysical world consciousness mind mental life observer's own body
does mean shall show later introspection kind psychological research nor does mean heart argument felt introspectively observed causes behavior
organism behaves does because current structure most out reach introspection
moment must content ourselves methodological behaviorist insists person's genetic environment histories
introspectively observed certain collateral products those histories
way repair major damage wrought mentalism
person does [is] attributed going inside investigation brought end
why explain explanation? twenty five hundred years people preoccupied feelings mental life recently any interest shown precise analysis role environment
ignorance role led first place mental fictions perpetuated explanatory practices gave rise
theoretical structure skinner's behavioral theory largely set forth first book behavior organisms
here gave systematic description manner environmental variables control behavior
distinguished two sorts behavior controlled different ways
first respondent behaviors elicited stimuli
these may modified through respondent conditioning often called pavlovian conditioning classical conditioning neutral stimulus paired eliciting stimulus
operant behaviors contrast emitted meaning initially induced any particular stimulus
strengthened through operant conditioning sometimes called instrumental conditioning occurrence response yields reinforcer
respondents might measured their latency strength operants their rate
both these sorts behavior already studied experimentally example respondents pavlov operants thorndike
skinner's account differed ways earlier ones first accounts bring them under roof
idea behavior strengthened weakened consequences raises several questions
among most important these operant responses strengthened reinforcement come first place? 2 once organism's repertoire how response directed controlled? 3 how very complex seemingly novel behaviors explained? origin operant behavior skinner's answer first question very much like darwin's answer question origin new bodily structure namely variation selection
similarly behavior individual varies moment moment variation followed reinforcement strengthened becomes prominent individual's behavioral repertoire
shaping skinner's term gradual modification behavior reinforcement desired variations
discussed later article skinner believed superstitious behavior arise response happens followed reinforcement actually unrelated
control operant behavior second question how operant behavior controlled? arises because begin behavior emitted without reference any particular stimulus
skinner answered question saying stimulus comes control operant present response reinforced absent
example lever-pressing brings food light rat child will learn press lever light
skinner summarized relationship saying discriminative stimulus e
light sets occasion reinforcement food operant lever-press
three-term contingency stimulus-response-reinforcer skinner's most important concepts sets theory apart theories use pair-wise associations
explaining complex behavior most behavior humans cannot easily described terms individual responses reinforced skinner devoted great deal effort problem behavioral complexity
complex behavior seen sequence relatively simple responses here skinner invoked idea chaining
chaining based fact experimentally demonstrated discriminative stimulus sets occasion subsequent behavior also reinforce behavior precedes
discriminative stimulus also conditioned reinforcer
example light sets occasion lever pressing may used reinforce turning around presence noise
results sequence noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food
much longer chains built adding stimuli responses
however skinner recognized great deal behavior especially human behavior cannot accounted gradual shaping construction response sequences
complex behavior often appears suddenly final form person first finds way elevator following instructions given front desk
account such behavior skinner introduced concept rule-governed behavior
first relatively simple behaviors come under control verbal stimuli child learns jump open book
after large number responses come under such verbal control sequence verbal stimuli evoke almost unlimited variety complex responses
reinforcement main article reinforcement reinforcement key concept behaviorism primary process shapes controls behavior occurs two ways positive negative
behavior organisms 1938 skinner defined negative reinforcement synonymous punishment presentation aversive stimulus
subsequently science human behavior 1953 skinner redefined negative reinforcement
now become standard set definitions positive reinforcement strengthening behavior occurrence event e
praise after behavior performed whereas negative reinforcement strengthening behavior removal avoidance aversive event e
opening raising umbrella over your head rainy day reinforced cessation rain falling you
both types reinforcement strengthen behavior increase probability behavior reoccurring difference whether reinforcing event something applied positive reinforcement something removed avoided negative reinforcement
punishment application aversive stimulus/event positive punishment punishment contingent stimulation removal desirable stimulus negative punishment punishment contingent withdrawal
though punishment often used suppress behavior skinner argued suppression temporary number other often unwanted consequences
extinction absence rewarding stimulus weakens behavior
writing 1981 skinner pointed out darwinian natural selection like reinforced behavior selection consequences
though natural selection now made case regretted essentially same process reinforcement less widely accepted underlying human behavior
schedules reinforcement main article schedules reinforcement skinner recognized behavior typically reinforced once together c
ferster extensive analysis various ways reinforcements arranged over time called schedules reinforcement
most notable schedules reinforcement studied skinner continuous interval fixed variable ratio fixed variable
methods used operant conditioning
continuous reinforcement crf — each time specific action performed subject receives reinforcement
method effective teaching new behavior because quickly establishes association target behavior reinforcer
interval schedules based time intervals reinforcements fixed interval schedule fi procedure reinforcements presented fixed time periods provided appropriate response made
schedule yields response rate low just after reinforcement becomes rapid just before next reinforcement scheduled
variable interval schedule vi procedure behaviour reinforced after random time durations following last reinforcement
schedule yields steady responding rate varies average frequency reinforcement
ratio schedules based ratio responses reinforcements fixed ratio schedule fr procedure reinforcement delivered after specific number responses made
variable ratio schedule vr procedure reinforcement comes after number responses randomized reinforcement next ex
slot machines
lower number responses required higher response rate tends
ratio schedules tend produce very rapid responding often breaks no responding just after reinforcement large number responses required reinforcement
scientific inventions operant conditioning chamber main article operant conditioning chamber operant conditioning chamber also known skinner box laboratory apparatus used experimental analysis animal behavior
invented skinner while graduate student harvard university received doctorate 1931
used skinner box lever rats disk wall pigeons
press manipulandum deliver food animal through opening wall responses reinforced way increased frequency
controlling reinforcement together discriminative stimuli such lights tones punishments such electric shocks experimenters used operant box study wide variety topics including schedules reinforcement discriminative control delayed response memory punishment
channeling research these directions operant conditioning chamber huge influence course research animal learning applications
enabled great progress problems studied measuring rate probability force simple repeatable response
however discouraged study behavioral processes easily conceptualized such terms - spatial learning particular now studied quite different ways example use water maze
cumulative recorder cumulative recorder makes pen-and-ink record simple repeated responses
skinner designed use operant chamber convenient way record view rate responses such lever press key peck
device sheet paper gradually unrolls over cylinder
each response steps small pen across paper starting edge pen reaches other edge quickly resets initial side
slope resulting ink line graphically displays rate response example rapid responses yield steeply sloping line paper slow responding yields line low slope
cumulative recorder key tool used skinner analysis behavior very widely adopted other experimenters gradually falling out use advent laboratory computer
skinner's major experimental exploration response rates presented book c
ferster schedules reinforcement full cumulative records produced device
air crib air crib easily cleaned temperature humidity-controlled enclosure intended replace standard infant crib
skinner invented device help wife cope day-to-day tasks child rearing
designed make early childcare simpler reducing laundry diaper rash cradle cap etc
while allowing baby mobile comfortable less prone cry
reportedly success these goals
air crib controversial invention
popularly mischaracterized cruel pen often compared skinner's operant conditioning chamber commonly called skinner box
association laboratory animal experimentation discouraged commercial success though several companies attempted production
2004 book lauren slater entitled opening skinner's box great psychology experiments twentieth century caused stir mentioning rumors skinner used baby daughter deborah experiments she subsequently committed suicide
although slater's book stated rumors false reviewer observer march 2004 misquoted slater's book supporting rumors
review read deborah skinner now deborah buzan artist writer living london vehement riposte guardian
teaching machine teaching machine mechanical invention automate task programmed learning teaching machine mechanical device whose purpose administer curriculum programmed learning
machine embodies key elements skinner’s theory learning important implications education general classroom instruction particular
incarnation machine box housed list questions viewed time through small window
see picture
there also mechanism through learner respond each question
upon delivering correct answer learner rewarded
skinner advocated use teaching machines broad range students e
preschool aged adult instructional purposes e
reading music
example machine envisioned teach rhythm
relatively simple device supplies necessary contingencies
student taps rhythmic pattern unison device
unison specified very loosely first student little early late each tap specifications slowly sharpened
process repeated various speeds patterns
another arrangement student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded machine though unison again specifications accurate reproduction progressively sharpened
rhythmic patterns also brought under control printed score
instructional potential teaching machine stemmed several factors provided automatic immediate regular reinforcement without use aversive control material presented coherent yet varied novel pace learning adjusted suit individual
result students interested attentive learned efficiently producing desired behavior learning doing
teaching machines though perhaps rudimentary rigid instruments instruction
adjusted improved based upon students’ performance
example student made many incorrect responses machine reprogrammed provide less advanced prompts questions- idea being students acquire behaviors most efficiently make few errors
multiple-choice formats best suited teaching machines because tended increase student mistakes contingencies reinforcement relatively uncontrolled
useful teaching explicit skills machines also promote development repertoire behaviors skinner called self-management
effective self-management means attending stimuli appropriate task avoiding distractions reducing opportunity reward competing behaviors
example machines encourage students pay attention before receiving reward
skinner contrasted common classroom practice initially capturing students’ attention e
lively video delivering reward e
entertainment before students actually performed any relevant behavior
practice fails reinforce correct behavior actually counters development self-management
skinner pioneered use teaching machines classroom especially primary level
today computers run software performs similar teaching tasks there resurgence interest topic related development adaptive learning systems
pigeon-guided missile main article project pigeon during world war ii us navy required weapon effective against surface ships such german bismarck class battleships
although missile tv technology existed size primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical
solve problem skinner initiated project pigeon intended provide simple effective guidance system
system divided nose cone missile three compartments putting pigeon each
lenses projected image distant objects onto screen front each bird
thus missile launched aircraft within sight enemy ship image ship appear screen
screen hinged such pecks image ship guide missile toward ship
despite effective demonstration project abandoned eventually conventional solutions such those based radar became available
skinner complained our problem no take us seriously
seemed few people trust pigeons guide missile no matter how reliable system appeared
verbal summator early career skinner became interested latent speech experimented device called verbal summator
device thought auditory version rorschach inkblots
using device human participants listened incomprehensible auditory garbage often read meaning heard
thus rorschach blots device intended yield overt behavior projected subconscious thoughts
skinner's interest projective testing brief later used observations summator creating theory verbal behavior
device also led other researchers invent new tests such tautophone test auditory apperception test azzageddi test
verbal behavior main article verbal behavior book challenged alfred north whitehead during casual discussion while harvard provide account randomly provided piece verbal behavior skinner set attempting extend then-new functional inductive approach complexity human verbal behavior
developed over two decades work appeared book verbal behavior
although noam chomsky highly critical verbal behavior conceded skinner's s-r psychology worth review
behavior analyists reject s-r characterization operant conditioning involves emission response then becomes less likely dependending upon consequence - see above
verbal behavior uncharacteristically cool reception partly result chomsky's review partly because skinner's failure address rebut any chomsky's criticisms
skinner's peers may slow adopt ideas presented verbal behavior because absence experimental evidence — unlike empirical density marked skinner's experimental work
however applied settings there resurgence interest skinner's functional analysis verbal behavior

december 2007 skinner's views influenced education well psychology
skinner argued education two major purposes teach repertoires both verbal nonverbal behavior 2 interest students learning
recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control providing reinforcement presence stimuli relevant learning task
because believed human behavior affected small consequences something simple opportunity move forward after completing stage activity effective reinforcer skinner 1961 p
skinner convinced learn student must engage behavior just passively receive information
skinner 1961 p
skinner believed effective teaching must based positive reinforcement argued effective changing establishing behavior punishment
suggested main thing people learn being punished how avoid punishment
example child forced practice playing instrument child comes associate practicing punishment thus learns hate avoid practicing instrument
view obvious implications then widespread practice rote learning punitive discipline education
use educational activities punishment may induce rebellious behavior such vandalism absence
because teachers primarily responsible modifying student behavior skinner argued teachers must learn effective ways teaching
technology teaching skinner chapter why teachers fail pages 93–113 says teachers given in-depth understanding teaching learning
without knowing science underpinning teaching teachers fall back procedures work poorly such using aversive techniques produce escape avoidance undesirable emotional effects relying telling explaining unfortunately student does learn simply shown
103 failing adapt learning tasks student's current level failing provide positive reinforcement frequently enough
skinner suggests any age-appropriate skill taught
steps clearly specify action performance student learn
break down task small achievable steps going simple complex
let student perform each step reinforcing correct actions
adjust student successful until finally goal reached
shift intermittent reinforcement maintain student's performance
skinner's views education extensively presented book technology teaching
also reflected fred s
keller's personalized system instruction ogden r
lindsley's precision teaching
walden two beyond freedom dignity skinner popularly known mainly books walden two beyond freedom dignity made cover time magazine
former describes fictional experimental community 1940 s united states
productivity happiness citizens community far greater outside world because residents practice scientific social planning use operant conditioning raising their children
walden two like thoreau's walden champions lifestyle does support war foster competition social strife
encourages lifestyle minimal consumption rich social relationships personal happiness satisfying work leisure
1967 kat kinkade founded twin oaks community using walden two blueprint
community still exists continues use planner-manager system other aspects described skinner's book
beyond freedom dignity skinner suggests technology behavior help make better society
however accept autonomous agent driving force our actions
skinner offers alternatives punishment challenges readers use science modern technology construct better society
political views skinner's political writings emphasized hopes effective human science behavioral control technology human behavior help problems yet unsolved often aggravated advances technology such atomic bomb
indeed skinner's goals prevent humanity destroying itself
saw political activity use aversive non-aversive means control population
skinner favored use positive reinforcement means control citing jean-jacques rousseau's novel emile education example literature fear power positive reinforcement
walden two
science human behavior used eliminate poverty sexual expression government know create lifestyle without such war
skinner's book walden two presents vision decentralized localized society applies practical scientific approach behavioral expertise deal peacefully social problems
example views led oppose corporal punishment schools letter california senate helped lead ban spanking
skinner's utopia both thought experiment rhetorical piece
book skinner answers problem exists many utopian novels good life? walden two answer life friendship health art healthy balance work leisure minimum unpleasantness feeling made worthwhile contributions society resources ensured part minimizing consumption
world save any part resources future must reduce consumption number consumers
skinner walden two p
skinner described novel my new atlantis reference bacon's utopia
milton's satan falls heaven ends hell
does say reassure himself? 'here least shall free
think fate old-fashioned liberal
he's going free he's going find himself hell
skinner william f
buckley jr firing line p
superstition pigeon skinner's experiments examined formation superstition favorite experimental animals pigeon
skinner placed series hungry pigeons cage attached automatic mechanism delivered food pigeon regular intervals no reference whatsoever bird's behavior
discovered pigeons associated delivery food whatever chance actions performing delivered subsequently continued perform these same actions
bird conditioned turn counter-clockwise cage making two three turns reinforcements
another repeatedly thrust head upper corners cage
third developed 'tossing' response placing head beneath invisible bar lifting repeatedly
two birds developed pendulum motion head body head extended forward swung right left sharp movement followed somewhat slower return
skinner suggested pigeons behaved influencing automatic mechanism their rituals experiment shed light human behavior experiment might demonstrate sort superstition
bird behaves there causal relation behavior presentation food although such relation lacking
there many analogies human behavior
rituals changing one's fortune cards good examples
few accidental connections ritual favorable consequences suffice set up maintain behavior spite many unreinforced instances
bowler released ball down alley continues behave she controlling twisting turning her arm shoulder another case point
these behaviors course no real effect upon one's luck upon ball half way down alley just present case food appear often pigeon nothing—or strictly speaking something else
modern behavioral psychologists disputed skinner's superstition explanation behaviors recorded
subsequent research e
staddon simmelhag 1971 while finding similar behavior failed find support skinner's adventitious reinforcement explanation
looking timing different behaviors within interval staddon simmelhag able distinguish two classes behavior terminal response occurred anticipation food interim responses occurred earlier interfood interval rarely contiguous food
terminal responses seem reflect classical opposed operant conditioning rather adventitious reinforcement guided process like observed 1968 brown jenkins their autoshaping procedures
causation interim activities such schedule-induced polydipsia seen similar situation rats also cannot traced adventitious reinforcement details still obscure staddon 1977
experiment also repeated humans less controlled manner popular british tv series trick treat leading similar conclusions those skinner
quotations admire myself person
my successes override my shortcomings
ethical control may survive small groups control population whole must delegated specialists—to police priests owners teachers therapists their specialized reinforcers their codified contingencies
mistake suppose whole issue how free man
issue improve way controlled
education survives learned forgotten
senses grow dull stimulating environment becomes less clear
reinforcing consequences no longer follow bored discouraged depressed
criticism section requires expansion
october 2015 j
staddon understood skinner ascribing dignity individuals involves giving them credit their actions
say skinner brilliant means skinner originating force
skinner's determinist theory right merely focus environment
originating force no choice saying things doing things
skinner's environment genetics both allowed compelled write book
similarly environment genetic potentials advocates freedom dignity cause them resist reality their own activities deterministically grounded
staddon new behaviorism 2 nd edition 2014 argued compatibilist position skinner's determinism any way contradictory traditional notions reward punishment believed
noam chomsky perhaps skinner's best known critic noam chomsky published review skinner's verbal behavior two years after published
chomsky argued skinner's attempt use behaviorism explain human language amounted little word games
conditioned responses account child's ability create understand infinite variety novel sentences
1959 review became better known book itself
chomsky's review credited launching cognitive movement psychology other disciplines
skinner rarely responded directly critics never formally replied chomsky's critique
many years later kenneth mac corquodale's reply endorsed skinner
chomsky also reviewed skinner's beyond freedom dignity using same basic motives verbal behavior review
among chomsky's criticisms skinner's laboratory work extended humans extended humans represented 'scientistic' behavior attempting emulate science scientific skinner scientist because rejected hypothetico-deductive model theory testing skinner no science behavior
psychodynamic psychology skinner repeatedly criticized supposed animosity towards freud psychoanalysis psychodynamic psychology
there clear evidence however skinner shared several freud's assumptions influenced freudian points view field among them analysis defense mechanisms such repression
study such phenomena skinner even designed own projective test verbal summator described above
