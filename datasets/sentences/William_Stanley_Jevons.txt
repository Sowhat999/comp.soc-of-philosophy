stodart jevons arrived quite early career doctrines constituted most characteristic original contributions economics logic
theory utility became keynote general theory political economy practically formulated letter written 1860 germ logical principles substitution similars may found view propounded another letter written 1861 philosophy found consist solely pointing out likeness things
theory utility above referred namely degree utility commodity continuous mathematical function quantity commodity available together implied doctrine economics essentially mathematical science took definite form paper general mathematical theory political economy written british association 1862
paper does appear attracted much attention either 1862 publication four years later journal statistical society till 1871 theory political economy appeared jevons set forth doctrines fully developed form
untill after publication work jevons became acquainted applications mathematics political economy made earlier writers notably antoine augustin cournot h
theory utility 1870 being independently developed somewhat similar lines carl menger austria léon walras switzerland
regards discovery connection value exchange final marginal utility priority belongs gossen no way detracts great importance service jevons rendered british economics fresh discovery principle way ultimately forced notice
reaction prevailing view sometimes expressed himself without due qualification declaration instance made commencement theory political economy value depends entirely upon utility lent itself misinterpretation
certain exaggeration emphasis may pardoned writer seeking attract attention indifferent public
neoclassical revolution reshape economics started
jevons explicitly distinguish concepts ordinal cardinal utility
cardinal utility allows relative magnitude utilities discussed while ordinal utility implies goods compared ranked according good provided most utility
although jevons predated debate ordinality cardinality utility mathematics required use cardinal utility functions
example theory political economy chapter ii subsection theory dimensions economic quantities jevons makes statement first place pleasure pain must regarded measured upon same scale having therefore same dimensions being quantities same kind added subtracted
speaking measurement addition subtraction requires cardinality does jevons' heavy use integral calculus
note cardinality does imply direct measurability jevons believe
practical economics principles economics 1905 portrait jevons published popular science monthly 1877 however theorist dealing fundamental data economic science brilliant writer practical economic questions jevons first received general recognition
serious fall value gold 1863 coal question 1865 placed front rank writer applied economics statistics remembered leading economists 19 th century even theory political economy never written
amongst economic works may mentioned money mechanism exchange 1875 written popular style descriptive rather theoretical wonderfully fresh original treatment full suggestiveness primer political economy 1878 state relation labour 1882 two works published after death namely methods social reform investigations currency finance containing papers appeared separately during lifetime
last-named volume contains jevons' speculations connection commercial crises sunspots
engaged time death upon preparation large treatise economics drawn up table contents completed chapters parts chapters
fragment published 1905 under title principles economics fragment treatise industrial mechanism society other papers
coal question jevons covered breadth concepts energy depletion recently revisited writers covering subject peak oil
example jevons explained improving energy efficiency typically reduced energy costs thereby increased rather decreased energy use effect now known jevons paradox
coal question remains paradigmatic study resource depletion theory
jevons's son h
stanley jevons published 800-page follow-up study 1915 difficulties estimating recoverable reserves theoretically finite resource discussed detail
relatively minor work commercial crises sun-spots jevons analyzed business cycles proposing crises economy might random events might based discernible prior causes
clarify concept presented statistical study relating business cycles sunspots
reasoning sunspots affected weather turn affected crops
crop changes then expected cause economic changes
subsequent studies found sunny weather small significant positive impact stock returns probably due impact traders' moods
logic logic piano 1864 jevons published pure logic logic quality apart quantity based boole's system logic freed considered false mathematical dress system
years immediately following devoted considerable attention construction logical machine exhibited before royal society 1870 means conclusion derivable any given set premises[clarification needed] mechanically obtained
1866 regarded great universal principle reasoning dawned upon 1869 published sketch fundamental doctrine under title substitution similars
expressed principle simplest form follows whatever true thing true like worked out detail various applications including logic piano mechanical computer designed built 1869
logic piano keyboard following year appeared elementary lessons logic soon became most widely read elementary textbook logic english language
meantime engaged upon much important logical treatise appeared 1874 under title principles science
work jevons embodied substance earlier works pure logic substitution similars also enunciated developed view induction simply inverse employment deduction treated luminous manner general theory probability relation probability induction knowledge various natural sciences enabled throughout relieve abstract character logical doctrine concrete scientific illustrations often worked out great detail
example discussion use one-way functions cryptography including remarks integer factorization problem foreshadowed use public key cryptography
jevons' general theory induction revival theory laid down whewell criticised john stuart mill put new form free non-essential adjuncts rendered whewell's exposition open attack
work whole most notable contributions logical doctrine appeared uk 19 th century
though less attractively written mill's system logic principles science book keeps much closer facts scientific practice
studies deductive logic consisting mainly exercises problems use students published 1880
1877 following years jevons contributed contemporary review articles mill intended supplement further articles eventually publish volume criticism mill's philosophy
these articles other republished after jevons' death together earlier logical treatises volume entitled pure logic other minor works
criticisms mill contain much ingenious much forcible whole cannot regarded taking rank jevons's other work

geometry jevons' contemporaries hermann von helmholtz interested non-euclidean geometry discussed two groups two-dimensional creatures group living plane while other living surface sphere
asserted since these creatures embedded two dimensions develop planar version euclidean geometry since nature these surfaces different arrive very different versions geometry
then extended argument three dimensions noting raises fundamental questions relationship spatial perception mathematical truth
jevons made almost immediate response article
while helmholtz focused how humans perceived space jevons focused question truth geometry
jevons agreed while helmholtz's argument compelling constructing situation euclidean axioms geometry apply believed no effect truth these axioms
jevons hence makes distinction truth applicability perception suggesting these concepts independent domain geometry
jevons claim geometry developed without any consideration spatial reality
instead suggested geometric systems representations reality fundamental way transcends perceive reality
jevons claimed there flaw helmholtz's argument relating concept infinitesimally small
concept involves how these creatures reason geometry space very small scale necessarily same reasoning helmholtz assumed global scale
jevons claimed euclidean relations reduced locally different scenarios helmholtz created hence creatures should able experience euclidean properties just different representation
example jevons claimed two-dimensional creatures living surface sphere should able construct plane even construct systems higher dimensions although may able perceive such situations reality reveal fundamental mathematical truths their theoretical existence
1872 helmholtz gave response jevons claimed helmholtz failed show why geometric truth should separate reality spatial perception
helmholtz criticized jevons' definition truth particular experiential truth
helmholtz asserts there should difference experiential truth mathematical truth these versions truth necessarily consistent
conversation helmholtz jevons microcosm ongoing debate truth perception wake introduction non-euclidean geometry late 19 th century
