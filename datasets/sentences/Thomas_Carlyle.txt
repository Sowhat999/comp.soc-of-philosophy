within united kingdom carlyle's success assured publication three-volume work french revolution history 1837
after completed manuscript first volume accidentally burned philosopher john stuart mill's maid carlyle second third volumes before rewriting first scratch
resulting work passion new historical writing
politically charged europe filled fears hopes revolution carlyle's account motivations urges inspired events france seemed powerfully relevant
carlyle's style historical writing stressed immediacy action often using present tense
carlyle chaotic events demanded called 'heroes' take control over competing forces erupting within society
while denying importance economic practical explanations events saw these forces 'spiritual' hopes aspirations people took form ideas often ossified ideologies formulas isms called them
carlyle's view dynamic individuals master events direct these spiritual energies effectively soon ideological 'formulas' replaced heroic human action society became dehumanised

interpretation widely cited muslim scholars seeking western support muhammad great men history
carlyle held great men should rule others should revere them view supported complex faith history evolutionary progress
societies like organisms evolve throughout history thrive time inevitably become weak die out giving place stronger superior breed

heroic vitalists feared recent trends toward democracy hand over power ill-bred uneducated immoral whereas their belief transcendent force nature directing itself onward upward gave hope force overrule favor strong intelligent noble

{rp|52} carlyle hero somewhat similar aristotle's magnanimous man person flourished fullest sense
however carlyle unlike aristotle world filled contradictions hero deal
heroes will flawed
their heroism lay their creative energy face these difficulties their moral perfection
sneer such person their failings philosophy those seek comfort conventional
carlyle called 'valetism' expression 'no man hero valet

carlyle criticised hereditary aristocratic leadership deadening however criticised democracy nonsensical though objective truth discovered weighing up votes
government should come those most able lead
how such leaders found how follow their lead something carlyle clearly say
marx engels agreed carlyle far criticism hereditary aristocracy
however criticised carlyle's plan use democracy find noblest other nobles form government ablest persons
caricature ape published vanity fair 1870
later writings carlyle sought examine instances heroic leadership history
letters speeches oliver cromwell 1845 presented positive image cromwell someone attempted weld order conflicting forces reform own day
carlyle sought make cromwell's words live their own terms quoting directly then commenting significance these words troubled context time
again intended make 'past' 'present' readers
essay occasional discourse negro question 1849 suggested slavery should never abolished else replaced serfdom
[citation needed] kept order argued forced work people otherwise lazy feckless
[citation needed] carlyle's support repressive measures governor edward eyre jamaica during morant bay rebellion further alienated old liberal allies
governor colony eyre fearful island wide uprising brutally suppressed rebellion many black peasants killed
hundreds flogged
also authorised execution george william gordon mixed-race colonial assemblyman suspected involvement rebellion
these events created great controversy britain resulting demands eyre arrested tried murdering gordon
john stuart mill organised jamaica committee demanded prosecution included well-known british liberal intellectuals such john bright charles darwin frederic harrison thomas hughes thomas huxley john tyndall herbert spencer
rival committee set up carlyle defence arguing eyre acted decisively restore order
supporters included john ruskin charles kingsley charles dickens alfred lord tennyson
twice eyre charged murder cases never proceeded

froude's life carlyle published over 1882–84
frankness book unheard usually respectful standards 19 th-century biographies period
froude's work attacked carlyle's family especially nephew alexander carlyle niece margaret aitken carlyle
however biography question consistent carlyle's own conviction flaws heroes should openly discussed without diminishing their achievements
froude designated carlyle himself biographer-to-be acutely aware belief
froude's defence decision my relations carlyle published posthumously 1903 including reprint carlyle's 1873 will carlyle equivocated express biography me really rather there should none
nevertheless carlyle will simultaneously completely deferred froude's judgement matter whose decision taken mine

reputation carlyle's early work remained high during 19 th century declined 20 th century
george orwell called master belittlement
even emptiest sneer whitman thought big man because lived big country victim does seem shrink little
power orator man phrases adjectives turned base use
reputation germany high because promotion german thought biography frederick great
friedrich nietzsche whose ideas comparable carlyle's respects dismissive moralism calling absurd muddlehead beyond good evil regarded thinker failed free himself very petty-mindedness professed condemn
carlyle's distaste democracy belief charismatic leadership unsurprisingly appealing joseph goebbels read carlyle's biography frederick hitler during last days 1945
many critics 20 th century identified carlyle influence fascism nazism
ernst cassirer argued myth state carlyle's hero worship contributed 20 th-century ideas political leadership became part fascist political ideology
sartor resartus recently recognised once unique masterpiece anticipating many major philosophical cultural developments existentialism postmodernism
argued critique ideological formulas french revolution provides good account ways revolutionary cultures turn repressive dogmatisms
essentially romantic carlyle attempted reconcile romantic affirmations feeling freedom respect historical political fact
many believe attracted idea heroic struggle itself any specific goal struggle being made
however carlyle's belief continued use humanity hero great man stated succinctly end essay muhammad heroes hero worship & heroic history concludes “the great man lightning out heaven rest men waited like fuel then too flame
