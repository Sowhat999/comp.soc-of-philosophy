account distinguished both lockean neo-lockean views deduce property rights idea self-ownership consequentialist accounts might license widespread ad hoc interference possessions groups individuals
chartier uses account ground clear statement natural law basis view solidaristic wealth redistribution individual persons often morally required response individuals grass-roots networks particular circumstances rather state-driven attempt achieve particular distributive pattern
advances detailed arguments workplace democracy rooted such natural law principles subsidiarity defending morally desirable likely outcome elimination injustice rather something mandated state
discusses natural law approaches land reform occupation factories workers
objects natural-law grounds intellectual property protections drawing theory property rights generally
develops general natural law account boycotts
anarchism chartier identifies himself left-wing market anarchist
approach market anarchism reflects indebtedness kevin carson's mutualism new classical natural law theory elaborated germain grisez john finnis anarcho-conservatism stephen r
clark new left-influenced left-libertarian decentralism karl hess socialism individualist anarchism benjamin tucker
chartier argues anarchism basis state unnecessary illegitimate dangerous elimination state will unleash human creativity
affinity anarchism differentiates other proponents natural-law ethics
natural law theorists st
thomas aquinas present frequently statists
often rejected consent-based theories state authority unrealistic arguing instead manner similar david hume's actually existing states deserve allegiance because their capacity preserve order
chartier contends state needed maintain social order natural law theorists need attached preference other means maintaining order including custom convention various voluntary arrangements
also linked concerns anarchism natural law theory indirectly defending anarchism against objections levelled natural law theorist mark c
murphy maintained arguments philosophical anarchism fail because misconstrue nature many people's support authority state-made law people believe authority state-made law entitled retain their beliefs face anarchist criticism
chartier argues response many people least belief state authority defeasible rightly undermined positive arguments against particular justifications authority state-made law
also important defense anarchism detailed justification conclusion appearances contrary notwithstanding institutions consensual polycentric legal order enforce law without becoming morally indistinguishable states
even economic justice natural law concerned particularly anarchism explicitly challenges necessity state discussion law natural law context focuses communal norms rules institutions—which need maintained using force intended understood elements polycentric legal order—rather state-made laws
capitalism freed markets chartier active participant discussions among market anarchists others aptness capitalism label participants conversation termed freed marketsin order distinguish them existing economic arrangements see shot through statist privilege
argued proponents genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism identify global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing abuses anti-capitalist movement highlights result state-tolerated violence state-secured privilege rather voluntary cooperation exchange
according chartier makes sense [left-libertarians] name oppose 'capitalism
ensures advocates freedom aren't confused people use market rhetoric prop up unjust status quo expresses solidarity defenders freed markets workers—as well ordinary people around world use 'capitalism' short-hand label world-system constrains their freedom stunts their lives
joined kevin carson charles johnson others echoing language benjamin tucker thomas hodgskin maintaining because heritage emancipatory goals potential radical market anarchism should seen—by proponents others—as part socialist tradition market anarchists should call themselves socialists
non-human animals while supporting vegetarianism affirming non-human animals moral standing chartier follows stephen r
clark rejecting consequentialist defenses vegetarianism like those offered peter singer
singer acknowledges consequentialist grounds might seem there little reason individuals concerned their dietary choices since few those choices will actually consequences any actual animals
singer maintains few dietary choices will crossing certain demand thresholds dramatically increase production animals food taking possibility account provides good reason avoid purchasing meat since there small chance single meat purchase might lead substantial negative consequences many animals
chartier dissects singer's argument maintaining unsuccessful because fails take proper account actual characteristics meat production market any similarly enormous market
examines detail consequentialist natural law virtue theoretic accounts boycotting meat industry concluding both natural law virtue theory provide limited grounds boycott might defended consequentialism does
while maintains tandem new classical natural law theorists consequentialism principle incoherent also challenges factual predictions made consequentialist proponents meat industry boycott
philosophy religion philosophical theology general topics chartier's work philosophy religion philosophical theology focused especially theodicy divine action also addressed range other topics including significance talk god personal christology relationship god ethics idea substitutionary atonement
meaning god-language chartier offered reading language god personal partly parallels logical behaviorist interpretations talk consciousness
suggests because cannot pretend know god like se sort reading while inappropriate applied finite persons helpful used relation god
divine action theodicy suggests talk divine action provides necessary starting point theological reflection argues reasonable way think divine action turn begin considering constraints credible talk divine providence imposed reality suffering evil
reviewing range options theodicy concludes while their underlying assumptions accounts creation different classical free will theism process theology lead very similar predictions regarding kinds divine action expected connection task constructive theology there therefore no need choose them though differences continue matter respect questions philosophy religion philosophical theology
does directly addresses questions related theodicy implies process philosophy offers satisfactory theodicy any alternative approach theism argues even process approach significant difficulty taking proper account reality animal suffering
maintains christian attempts use incarnation component theodicy rendered problematic need articulate belief incarnational christology using robust account divine action seems likely itself make harder resolve problem evil god business working miracles such robust view implies why aren't there them?
theism ethics chartier argues divine command views ethics turn out inconsistent talk god's love world
talk love context meaningful intelligible sense given notion beloved's well being independent choice lover theist cannot maintain god love without acknowledging objective sense given notion creaturely flourishing apart god's will
range reasonable moral principles constrained facts flourishing basic moral norms seem credible independently divine volition
imposing obligations over above those following these principles itself unloving thing
atonement criticizing substitutionary accounts atonement chartier notes such theories purport committed belief retributive justice thus fall victim standard objections retributivism
same time however allowing substituted punishment imply view justice unlikely satisfactory retributivists themselves
publications chartier author five scholarly books—anarchy legal order radicalizing rawls economic justice natural law analogy love conscience anarchist—and articles journals including oxford journal legal studies law philosophy legal theory ucla law review religious studies co-editor charles johnson markets capitalism
reactions publications david gordon praised radicalizing rawls chartier written book outstanding merit

symposium studies emergent order devoted book skoble added chartier's argument demonstrates natural law theory compatible spontaneous order theory also confluence points voluntary polycentric legal order
book thus valuable offering robust defense polycentrism doing way ties together two important threads liberal tradition natural law spontaneous order doing enhances our understanding both
also writing symposium jason brennan criticized chartier's reliance controversial new natural law theory objected embrace theory's view basic aspects well being incommensurable view brennan suggested led counterintuitive implausible conclusions
while expressing concerns feasibility chartier’s proposals paul dragos aligica concluded anarchy legal order currently book read wants explore potential limits natural law non-aggression maxim praxeology based doctrines stateless social order
