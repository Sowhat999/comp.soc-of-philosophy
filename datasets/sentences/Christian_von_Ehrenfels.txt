concept gestalt itself first introduced contemporary philosophy psychology ehrenfels famous work über gestaltqualitäten qualities form 1890
both edmund husserl seem inspired mach's work beiträge zur analyse empfindungen contributions analysis sensations 1886 formulate their very similar concepts gestalt figural moment respectively
analysis transition melody another key became famous
ehrenfels explained melody consists individual sounds considerably sum these notes
individual notes able join themselves completely different melodies while melody remain same transposed another key containing single tones
new opinion came up “perception whole” compared “parts” ehrenfels called gestaltqualitäten figure qualities
compare aristotle trans
1952 “in case things several parts whole like heap particular something besides parts there must such uniting factor”
1890 s ehrenfels-who passionate fan richard wagner-befriended fellow wagnerite british born german völkisch thinker houston stewart chamberlain evangelist race
ehrenfels despite being wagnerite friend chamberlain's generally associate himself extreme racist anti-semitic wing wagner movement chamberlain came leader
ehrenfels never accepted chamberlain's anti-semitism influenced chamberlain's theory aryan race greatest best race them
chamberlain later affair ehrenfels's wife baroness emma von ehrenfels
monogamy polygamy ehrenfels argued numerous cultural-scientific sexual-political writings against cultural harmfulness monogamy utopia polygynian social order
defended opinion monogamy hinder darwinistic reproduction-logic procreation-selection devastating effect society cultural-biological way therefore monogamy should combated
those theories ehrenfels exposed himself massive criticism because offered theories unimaginable thoughts contemporary western conventions
basis ehrenfels's thinking new sexual order expressed series essays published several academic journals germany austria 1902-1910
essays ehrenfels began argument men naturally monogamous monogamy something come europe christianity
ehrenfels stated through monogamy useful functions such iron discipline imposed european men whole europeans suffered terribly unnatural condition monogamy seriously interfered darwinian progress ensuring survival fittest ehrenfels avid social darwinist
ehrenfels believed polygamy nature intended men allowed fittest men father many children possible many women possible process virile selection
ehrenfels disgust monogamy type sexual life
corresponded needs capacities women cost men
contrast ehrenfels believed women naturally monogamous women desired good husband look after them
ehrenfels further believed social problems caused unnatural state christian monogamy caused splitting man's day consciousness professed believe christian marriage night consciousness man's naturally aggressive animistic sex drive come play
ehrenfels argued splitting within men their day consciousness night consciousness caused men sorts psychological trauma led men acting irrational often violent ways
specific example sort male irrationality brought up enrenfels concerning splitting men abusing prostitutes visited
additionally ehrenfels argued psychological splitting led men treat their wives badly men forced unnatural condition monogamy feminist movement entire women's question arose response enrenfels believed women's question naturally resolve itself husbands learn treat their wives better
finally ehrenfels argued monogamy root social question meant ehrenfels meant rise austrian social democratic party encouraged men leave their fortunes their children something ehrenfels believed natural also something very often contradicts demands social justice
result wealth being spread privilegistic means opposed meritocratic means poor felt resentment voting socialist parties promised abolish inequality
ehrenfels believed humanity naturally unequal demand universal human equality fought totally unnatural
1908 essay proud aristocrat baron von enrenfels called demand universal equality being made social democrats preposterous
yellow peril moreover ehrenfels obsessed fear yellow peril believed asian peoples deadly threat european civilization
ehrenfels believed asians especially dangerous enemies europeans because east asia polygamy accepted natural part social order
ehrenfels warned process socially victorious chinese men taking many wives possible ultimately grave threat west
result polygamy genetically superior asian men fathering many children possible many women possible while genetically superior european men fathering children woman
result european monogamy asian polygamy europeans losing out asians matter time before genetic edge allowed asians destroy european civilization
social darwinist racist ehrenfels saw history endless racial struggle fittest races surviving
ehrenfels took granted whites asians natural enemies
ehrenfels's viewpoint fact chinese capable working hard while eating less europeans important sign asian race thanks polygamy starting become stronger tougher race
ehrenfels alarm average constitutional strength chinese their resistance overwork
noxious prejudicial influences kinds
exceeds civilized peoples west astonishing degree
ehrenfels warned progress allowed continue then beautiful aryan race whom ehrenfels compared clear mountain streams purest white milk swept away asian torrents mud
ehrenfels stated racist anti-asian immigrant laws like chinese exclusion act united states good first step insufficient stop rise tough fecund mongol race
> ehrenfels's solution ehrenfels proposed solution away monogamy create new social order based polygamy
begin state take complete control human sexuality
ehrenfels's new society highest goal improvement human constitution allowing fittest white men breed
ehrenfels's new society those white men proved themselves social winners allowed marry number wives man based upon degree success
successful man wives
> state assign man wives after determining social success other features such health looks morality intelligence
woman contrast allowed husband time
women forced live communal barracks expense state help other each raise their children their husbands visit sex
proposed new society romantic love done away relations men women sexual
men social losers certain number genetically less fit women sterilized turned courtesan class set aside sexual use loser men brothels
since ehrenfels's viewpoint men really wanted women sex love new society men suffer psychological problems caused monogamy thus ending splitting
since new society meritocratic solve entire social question
furthermore new society women living their communal barracks help each other raising children women time leisure such ehrenfels believed women come see new society huge improvement over previous monogamist society
their husbands now free monogamy treat them better entire women's question dissolve women lose interest feminism enrenfels saw very unnatural
end yellow peril once ehrenfels suggested white nations band together conquer asian nations before too late create new world racial order hereditary racially determined caste system
ehrenfels's vision whites serve oligarchic aryan military intellectual castes asians blacks slave castes supporting whites
prevent miscegenation interracial sex capital crime offenders publicly hanged
until russian-japanese war 1904-05 ehrenfels believed these sort radical changes happened sometime far-future ehrenfels put 1902 aryan will respond imperative sexual reform waves mongolian tide lapping around neck
after japan's victory over russia 1905 ehrenfels absolute necessity radical sexual reform continued existence western races men
raised level discussion level scientifically proven fact
1907 essay ehrenfels radical sexual reform now question 'to be'
no time lose
ehrenfels suggested starting point austrian government begin allow soldiers upon completing their military service polygamous marriages those soldiers proven themselves especially intelligent brave physically fit largest number wives
subsequently ehrenfels made public appeal manly aryan men proved themselves both social winners studs disregard monogamy marriage start impregnating many women possible give white race genetic edge coming war against yellow peril
before russian-japanese war chinese personified asian threat ehrenfels after war asian enemy future japanese
essays 1907-1908 ehrenfels chinese lacked potentialities
determination initiative productivity invention organizational talent
while chinese now listless mass allegedly mindless asians ehrenfels japan first-rate military power should japanese conquer chinese japanese engage selective breeding create race healthy sly cunning coolies virtuosos reproduction china
once happened ehrenfels warned vast sino-japanese army set conquer world consisting genetically superior soldiers whom western powers unable stop
public acceptance ehrenfels's ideas widely accepted public very fact allowed publish essays new society intellectually prestigious learned academic journals germany austria show ideas part intellectual mainstream first years 20 th century
social darwinism racism part intellectual mainstream west widespread belief white men starting become soft white men continued lose their masculine hardness inevitably led process racial degeneration end whites becoming enslaved yellow peril
opposition however ehrenfels's ideas meet disagreement
december 1908 sigmund freud invited ehrenfels give lecture proposed new society
audience generally offered polite dissent ehrenfels participant calling new society adolescent sexual fantasy
ehrenfels's proposed new society earned criticism catholic church objected attacks christian monogamy feminists offended idea women should kept essentially chattels treated sex objects men romantic everywhere upset plans abolish romantic love
american historian edward ross dickinson pieces ehrenfels's thinking mainstream way brought them together idiosyncratic
dickinson suggested these ideas rooted ehrenfels's own tormented sexuality both fascinated/repulsed sex
ehrenfels brought up extremely conservative sexually repressive roman catholic family teenage years onwards felt deep shame guilt sexual desires
despite obsession sex ehrenfels enraged pornography wanted see ruthlessly stamped out indecent popular culture vienna saw far too sexualized
ehrenfels especially offended animierkneipen hostess bar type popular bar austria buxom waitresses wore very low-cut dresses encouraged flit male customers order get them buy drinks animierkneipen waitresses paid commissions based their nightly sales alcohol
ehrenfels deeply disgusted sight women flaunting their sexuality manipulate men wanted animierkneipen banned
besides ehrenfels complained constantly indecent puns used ordinary people courtesan style modern fashion pornography humorous weeklies comic songs farces operettas
dickinson ehrenfels men suffering called tortuously shackled animal personality created monogamy almost certainly writing himself
dickinson suggested based upon reading ehrenfels's private letters concerns psychological splitting within men based upon own visits prostitutes saw johns abusing prostitutes may himself badly treated prostitutes sex letters somewhat ambiguous point
frequently ehrenfels brought up example how psychological splitting causing men abuse prostitutes may very well reflected guilty conscience part past abuse inflicted prostitutes whose services used
1908 essay entitled yellow peril ehrenfels 13 years earlier 1895 arrived basis personal experience superfluous recount here following two alternatives 'either am individual totally corrupt sex instincts our monogamous sexual order institution completely corrupting tendencies
flight domesticity novels late 19 th century british historian john tosh called flight domesticity novels became very popular major influence ehrenfels
flight domesticity novels typically dealt ruggedly tough male lived life own terms usually alone remote frontier place almost never relationship woman children
heroes flight domesticity novels usually frontiersman hunter cowboy scout other suitably adventuresome manly occupation
because heroes flight domesticity novels lived wild harmony nature portrayed being morally purer authentic then people lived modern civilization
hero flight domesticity novel strong silent type taciturn tough guy lived uncompromisingly own code honor embodied typical male values like courage self-reliance far better men lived civilization
typical flight domesticity novels allan quatermain novels british novelist h
rider haggard dealing adventures british frontiersman 19 th century south africa western novels german novelist karl may dealing adventures german immigrant cowboy old shatterhand apache best friend winnetou american old west scott allen cameron novels canadian novelist ralph connor mountie singly-handedly upholding law rocky mountains western adventure novels irish-american novelist thomas mayne reid
typical hero reid's novels extremely popular united states europe described being gallant skillful arms far ease around men around women lots time trappers soldiers little upper classes intellectuals much happier hunting killing thinking
tosh argued end 19 th century burdens being husband father modern industrialized urban society such many men fantasized chucking escape domesticity live life unburdened demands job children wife any other social obligation
hence popularity flight domesticity novels celebrated masculine primitive
ehrenfels's ideas new society men live apart women children participate raising their children whose relationships their wives entirely sexual bear very strong resemblance themes flight domesticity novels
significantly ehrenfels believed new society men burdened demands family life allow them live fuller adventuresome lives like type depicted flight domesticity books
ehrenfels's own fantasies manly aryan heroes battling yellow peril single-handedly kill hundreds evil asians while sleeping every white women sight never having relationship raising children appeared sexualized version macho fantasies found flight domesticity novels
should noted flight domesticity writers took same racist line ehrenfels may particular being very sympathetic towards plight native-americans old shatterhand novels
many flight domesticity books non-white peoples like zulus apache depicted admiringly rather patronizingly noble savages their primitive state preserved certain spiritual qualities people industrialized west long since lost
ehrenfels like many other men time seemed liked flight domesticity novels celebration masculine primitive purer rawer tougher form masculinity alleged exist wild found civilization
wilhelm ii april 1895 german emperor wilhelm ii nightmare nations europe appeared prehistoric warrior goddesses protected germany took form archangel michael
east threatened dark stormy cloud chinese-style dragon carried buddha wreathed fire under marched millions asians destroyed their path killing whites
after nightmare wilhelm regarded message god coming apocalyptic great race war europe asia decide future 20 th century painting nightmare done court painter hermann knackfuss september 1895
painting known yellow peril painting very popular time
ehrenfels saw yellow peril painting december 1895 greatly impressed
1895 onwards ehrenfels greatly influenced yellow peril propaganda put out german government wilhelm repeatedly warned alleged asian menace west
wagnerite deeply involved various wagner societies vienna ehrenfels got know prince philip von eulenburg german ambassador austria-hungary anti-asian racist promoted fear yellow peril anybody listen
broadly ehrenfels's yellow peril anti-asian racism part environment non-white men depicted threatening rape white women
racist viewpoint protect their women being raped white men wage primitive primordial racial war against yellow peril justified both white supremacy male supremacy
same sort language imagery frequently invoked fears race war blacks jews
european racists often considered jews race apart rest humanity jews lumped blacks asians
dickinson's critique dickinson noted ehrenfels fear yellow peril expressed water imagery noting how ehrenfels warned flood chinese coming west chinese torrent mud europe drowning japanese polluting liquid europeans respond menace until waves asians up their neck
german historian klaus theweleit same threatening water imagery frequently used writings freikorps men during interwar period threats jews communists usually same thing these writings rather asians threatened subsume german men
theweleit right-wing german men served freikorps during interwar period obsessed proving their masculinity establishing their hardness water imagery reflected their fear women erotic love intimacy dependence things threatened make them less manly
theweleit argued 1977 book männerphantasien male fantasies water imagery associated sexuality loss self-control
reviewing theweleit's book 1987 american historian paul robinson
can't read without feeling mr
theweleit onto something piling up examples eventually begins take toll even most skeptical
dickinson argued men like ehrenfels felt same sexual anxieties their masculinity writers examined theweleit projected these anxieties onto yellow peril rather judeo-bolshevism
love often mean certain loss self-control those love often invoke images being swept away swallowed up
dickinson argued ehrenfels self-proclaimed macho manly man aryan alpha male prospect being love someone terrifying meant possibility losing control projected those fears-which expressed water imagery-onto asians
ehrenfels often denied quite vehemently marriage anything love writing before own marriage marriage final analysis sexual provision two persons opposite sex through mutual exclusive contractual agreement intercourse
our morality tries cover matter
instead sexual provision speak unity souls contractual agreement coitus
less transparently veiled term 'community bed table'
dickson ehrenfels's efforts deny man ever love woman suggested huge fear emotional dependence part
dickinson noted ehrenfels's intense bouts depression together periods manic activity suggested degree emotional instability part adding number prominent men period less conform same pattern
gail bederman described related personality structures g
stanley hall theodore roosevelt
both exhibited manic restlessness quasi-messianic self-regard insecure masculine sexuality fear racial degeneration bizarre theories regarding regenerating evolutionary power masculine sexuality genocidal instincts males-who each believed naturally sought exterminate men other races part struggle survival fittest
emperor wilhelm ii germany while probably closer outright mental illness exhibited similar traits-including manic activity intellectual eclecticism megalomania occasional nervous breakdowns genocidal cogitations concern 'yellow peril'
ehrenfels projected feminine qualities onto chinese using feminine verbs writing chinese compared china woman after 1904
german language three sorts verbs masculine feminine neutral
ehrenfels's fear chinese reflected fear feminine might overwhelm masculine through powers love sex
contrast ehrenfels used masculine verbs writing japanese often compared japanese rival male seeking dominate woman china competition european powers also compared males
dickison argued ehrenfels's constant use sort sexualized language power aggression domination writing china reflected own fear sex love sexual dependence sexual adequacy man most emotional dependence
dickinson further noted great irony ehrenfels's life namely own biography disapproved theories men sex-crazed animals incapable love either women their lives their children
accounts ehrenfels indeed deeply love wife two children
dickinson noted many ehrenfels's ideas seem anticipate national socialism case
within first decade 20 th century radical members eugenics-social darwinist movement germany already advocating killing physically and/or mentally disabled best way improving aryan race
ehrenfels deeply horrified these ideas made clear proposed new society mentally physically disabled prevented marrying enough
ehrenfels lived long enough appalled action t4 progamme launched german government january 1939 exterminate physically mentally disabled people reich included austria
likewise ehrenfels opposed antisemitism writing there no jewish bogey threatening aryan race called antisemitism silly argued jews very useful allies aryans coming war asians
ehrenfels parted company friend houston stewart chamberlain believed coming great race war asians together blacks fight under leadership jews against aryans
