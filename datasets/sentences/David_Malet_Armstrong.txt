philosophy armstrong's philosophy broadly naturalistic
sketch systematic metaphysics armstrong states philosophical system rests upon assumption exists space time world physical world say
justifies saying physical world seems obviously exist while other things seem much hypothetical
fundamental assumption flows rejection abstract objects including platonic forms
armstrong's development philosopher influenced heavily john anderson david lewis j

martin collection critical essays john locke george berkeley
armstrong's philosophy while systematic does spend any time social ethical matters also does attempt build philosophy language
once described slogan 'put semantics last' universals & scientific realism rebuts arguments favour plato's theory forms rely semantics describing long think whole discreditable tradition tries settle ontological questions basis semantic considerations
metaphysics universals metaphysics armstrong defends view universals exist although platonic uninstantiated universals exist
those universals match up fundamental particles science tells us
armstrong describes philosophy form scientific realism
armstrong's universals sparse every predicate will accompanying property those deemed basic scientific investigation
ultimate ontology universals realised completion physical science
mass thus universal subject mass being discarded future physicists
armstrong realises will need refer use properties considered universals sparse ontology—for instance being able refer something being game use example wittgenstein's philosophical investigations
armstrong then suggests supervenience relation exists these second order properties ontologically authentic universals given us physics
armstrong's theory universals treats relations having no particular ontological difficulty treated same way non-relational properties
how armstrong's theory universals deals relations varying adicities raised issue fraser mac bride
mac bride argues there relations number terms relation varies across instances
armstrong's response affirm theory describes principle instantial invariance wherein adicity properties essential invariant
according armstrong complex relations seem challenge principle ontologically real second-order properties reduced basic properties subscribe principle instantial invariance
armstrong rejects nominalist accounts properties attempt align properties simply classes
coextension problem face properties simply classes world blue things also wet class nominalists unable draw distinction property being blue being wet
provides analogy argument euthyphro say electrons electrons because part class electrons puts cart before horse
part class electrons because electrons
armstrong's view nominalisms also criticised producing blob theory reality
objects structure parts those parts made molecules turn made up atoms standing relation another turn made up subatomic particles
blobbiness also threatens platonic universals particular instantiating universal world platonic universals becomes matter blob-particular having relation universal elsewhere platonic heaven say rather having internal relation way chemical element does constituent atom
terms origin armstrong's view universals armstrong says view universals relatively unexplored territory points hilary putnam's 1970 paper 'on properties' possible forerunner
also says plato later works aristotle scholastic realists ahead contemporary philosophy matter although handicapped relative backwardness science scientific methodology their day
states affairs central armstrong's philosophy idea states affairs facts russell's terminology sketch systematic metaphysics armstrong claims states affairs fundamental structures reality
state affairs roughly put instantiation particular universal state affairs might particular atom exists instantiating universal say particular element chemical elements ultimately accepted part armstrong's universals
particulars armstrong's ontology must least universal—just rejects uninstantiated universals also rejects unpropertied particulars
armstrong argues states affairs distinct things ontology because sum their parts
particular non-symmetric relation r another particular then r differs r
may case r obtains world r does
without states affairs instantiating particulars universals including relations cannot account truth case falsity other
laws nature armstrong's theory universals gives basis understanding laws nature being relations universals non-humean account laws nature proposed independently armstrong michael tooley fred dretske
account posits relations universals truthmakers statements physical laws realist accepts laws nature feature world rather just way talk world
armstrong identifies laws holding universals rather particulars account laws involving just particulars rather universals adequately explain how laws nature operate case counterfactuals
illustrate theory stephen mumford gives example ravens black
under theory armstrong tooley dretske there relation necessity universals ravenhood blackness rather there being relationship every single raven
allows explanation laws nature instantiated
mumford cites frequently-used example moa bird supposed every bird now-extinct species died young age though because anything genetic makeup
rather died mainly because virus just happened sweep through population
bird escaped virus eaten predator day before fiftieth birthday
under theory armstrong tooley dretske such coincidence law nature
dispositions armstrong rejects dispositionalism idea dispositional properties powers sometimes referred ontologically significant important role explaining laws nature
armstrong believes challenge dispositionalism presents account laws nature case manifested dispositions say glass dropping ground breaking unmanifested dispositions fact counter factually drop glass ground break
armstrong simply states disposition simply nature instantiated properties thing supposed disposition
truth truthmakers regarding truth armstrong holds describes maximalist version truthmaker theory believes every truth truthmaker although there doesn't necessarily exist one-to-one mapping truth truthmaker
possibility many relations truths truthmakers feature armstrong believes allows truthmaker theory answer criticisms levelled older correspondence theories truth believes truthmaker theory improved version
negative truths truthmakers armstrong's account gives example wall painted green
wall being painted green truth proposition painted white proposition painted red
difficulty providing adequate account truthmakers events past reason armstrong gives rejecting presentism—the view present exists another reason being incompatibility such view special relativity
presentists armstrong argues must either deny truthmakers needed statements past account them postulating rather strange truthmakers
mind armstrong holds physicalist functionalist theory mind
initially attracted gilbert ryle's concept mind rejection cartesian dualism
armstrong accept behaviourism instead defended theory referred central-state theory identifies mental states state central nervous system
materialist theory mind accepted mental states such consciousness exist stated explained physical phenomena
armstrong attributes adoption central-state theory work j
smart—specifically paper 'sensations brain processes'—and traces lineage there ullin place's 1956 paper 'is consciousness brain process?' stephen mumford armstrong's materialist theory mind represents authoritative statement australian materialism still seminal piece philosophy
epistemology armstrong's view knowledge conditions knowledge satisfied you justified true belief you arrived through reliable process belief caused factor external world hence label externalism
armstrong uses analogy thermometer thermometer changes reflect temperature environment must one's beliefs reliably formed
connection knowledge external world armstrong nomological relationship law nature relationship
here armstrong's view broadly similar alvin goldman robert nozick
intuitions lead kind externalism led alvin plantinga towards account knowledge added requirement 'properly-functioning' cognitive systems operating according design plan
belief question relationship beliefs knowledge armstrong defends weak acceptance belief condition namely person know thing p she believes p
paper aristotelian society armstrong rejects series linguistic arguments rejection belief condition argue knowledge without having belief because common usage word 'belief' imply lack knowledge—armstrong gives example you asked man railway station whether train just left believe you take does know
armstrong also argues contradictory beliefs show there connection beliefs knowledge
gives example woman learned her husband dead cannot bring herself believe her husband dead
she both believes disbelieves her husband dead just happens her two beliefs justified true satisfies knowledge conditions
armstrong presents response colin radford's modified version unconfident examinee example
student asked queen elizabeth died hesitatingly answers 1603 exhibits no confidence answer
forgotten point previously studied english history
radford presents example knowledge without belief
armstrong differs unconfident examinee belief queen elizabeth died 1603 knows she died 1603 does know knows
armstrong rejects kk principle—that know thing p must know knows p
armstrong's rejection kk principle consistent wider externalist project
