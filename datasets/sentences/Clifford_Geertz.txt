earliest scholars see insights provided common language philosophy literary analysis major explanatory force social sciences
geertz aimed provide social sciences understanding appreciation “thick description
geertz applied thick description anthropological studies specifically own 'interpretive anthropology' while producing theory implications other social sciences
example geertz asserted culture essentially semiotic nature theory implications comparative political sciences
max weber interpretative social science strongly present geertz’s work
