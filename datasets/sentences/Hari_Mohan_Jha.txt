present article intends critically analyze representative stories find out factors account unprecedented popularity maithili short story writer
exhaustive introduction prof
jha’s selected stories published sahitya akademi perhaps most detailed criticism short stories raj mohan jha puts them four categories basis varying degrees humour satire them stories proportionate balance humour satire ii serious satirical stories iii light-hearted humorous stories iv stories pathos central emotion
classification other kinds also possible
me prof
jha’s stories broadly divided two groups stories dramatize life those transcribe
first story-teller par excellence like somerset maugham second story writer like chekhov sharing natural ease power successfully render emotion words pass reader making collaborator
fact most stories world placed either these groups
whether short story writer presents dramatization life interest excite surprise direct copy life through symbolism imagery depends choice ability demands plot
two most popular names dramatization life maupassant maugham while chekhov katherine mansfield stand forerunners transcription life type
chekhov even ordinary character situation like “people going offices quarrelling their wives eating cabbage soup” provide sufficient material short story
maugham enough “in order make story must steal petty cash office murder leave their wives eat their cabbage soup must emotion significance”
because preference stories narrated type “told over dinner table ship’s smoking room held attention listeners
jha’s short stories wonderful combination chekhov maugham
chooses style according purpose stories excels both types
primarily account honest representation life’s realities
how nicely lie love politics deceive brethren even god deception art something unpardonable inexcusable intolerable
first group prof
jha’s short stories comprises major chunk became popular even among illiterate catapulted fame overnight became household name
these stories narrated type read individually shared group gathered village choupal fireside
instant mass-appeal there no attempt part writer make them classy
elaborate plot-pattern graphic detailed delineation character string comic situations
readers whom situations familiar characters easily identifiable found them stories their own life
stories collected pranamya devata presenting us modern versions eleven rudras placed category narrated type exploit dramatization full humorous satirical effects
debate whether stories otherwise most unfounded
stories character same order luncheon mr
jha calls them “satirical sketches” their western counterparts least respect their social purpose pen-pictures various types men women hypocrite milkmaid dull physician young raw preacher etc drawn early 17 th century essayists like hall overbury earle dekker fuller others
inspired theophrastus influenced largely seneca dramatists especially ben jonson’s comedy humours these writers made ‘character’ favourite form description satire
fact prof
jha less same thing stories their essays
vogue such character portrayal continued 18 th century periodical essayists like addison steele oliver goldsmith
jha shares them general purpose their essays “to expose false arts life pull off disguise cunning vanity affectation recommend general simplicity dress discourse behaviour”
album portrait gallery pranamya devata ‘menagerie’ short dozen odd creatures vying supremacy
book dedicated whom author considers supreme contender readers may their own pick
quite assortment funny characters foursome queer gluttonous guests unscrupulously callous inconvenience host vikat pahun/ odd guests greedy newly-wed young man wants show off cost poor father-in-law adarsh kutumb/an ideal relation poor pitiable husband compelled live affluent in-law subsequently reduced status domestic servant ghar jamai/living in-law illiterate uncouth southern brahmin cannot even pronounce correctly name culturally superior wife bhadeshak namoona/sample off-country anglicized fop whose discomfiture reminds khushwant singh’s karma angrejia babu / anglicized youth
there also poet poetaster rather vast gap practice precept kaviji poet
professed emancipator woman turns out jealous husband revolutionary poet shows real skin cat rattles door night
likewise there orthodox theologian hypocrite astrologer avaricious pundit leech insurance agent pursue underworld get deal
together complete social scenario mithila prof
jha’s time
these stories combine entertainment enlightenment level literary accomplishment cultural sensitivity
group stories narrated type may add two another collection charchari
tirhutaam hospitality tirhut teerthyatra pilgrimage
first dramatizes how excessive hospitality often becomes cause pain discomfort
second exposure rapacious pandas holy places while also highlights selfishness narrow-mindedness people even while moving team
narrated stories prof
jha taken whole lack compactness singularity incident perception total artistic detachment characterize modern short story
narration loose detailed satirical intent well-marked
characters realistically sketched types akin jonsonion ‘humour’ characters their dominant traits drawn prominence
there certainly elements exaggeration plot character situation far being implausible essential comic satiric effects
there deliberate attempt inflate characters out proportion overstretching them caricatures punctured bang
aim these stories just tickle us humour rather serious social concern
example stories like ghar jamai bhadeshak namoona angrejia babu deal incompatibility marriage three different angles
dharmashashtracharya jyotishacharya dispel clouds self-created myths theologians astrologers exposing them their bones
second category prof
jha’s shorter fiction comprises beautiful transcriptions life such pieces panch patra five letters kanyak jeevan life girl child maryadak bhang loss grace gram sevika lady village worker graduate putohu graduate daughter-in-law railak anubhav experience train journey
artistically superior earlier group these real gems prof
jha’s stories them like panch patra kanyak jeevan compete best world literature
earlier stories invariably feel presence author personal comments messages allowed go overtly stated
quite keeping social satire writing
here snippets life presented total objectivity bareness conciseness chekhovian story
author withdraws himself lets story unfold itself
message there artistically interwoven story
panch patra marvellous example prof
jha’s multi-dimensional art first glance moving account life-time interwoven hopes aspirations sorrows sufferings memories desires lower middle-class sanskrit teacher
five brief letters written purposively interval decade word-pictures combine form collage whole life
description different mental states creation corresponding atmosphere presentation conflicting emotions powerful use imagery lend story poetic dimensions
letters read five acts drama five chapters novel well-marked points climax denouement story
also stand dramatic monologues revealing weaknesses protagonist while talks others
also present progression life terms purushartha chatustaya karma kama artha dharma moksha four ashramas brahmacharya garhastah vanprastha sanyaas
contradiction dualities viz
life death pleasure pain youth age dream reality attachment renunciation bring story very close life’s truth
equally touching tale kanyak jeevan pathetic saga child widow compresses tragedy life-time easily earns epithet ‘great’
pathos generated juxtaposition two pictures same girl drawn two different points time tittir dai innocent playful girl just fourteen years thence young widow mother four including two marriageable daughters her body barely clad tattered sari her face reflecting “leaden-eyeed despairs”
story capacity move readers their depths done me bringing tears my eyes each time read
say prof
jha counted among great even written nothing else single piece like emily bronte wuthering heights margaret mitchell gone wind
kind story felt retell mangle destroy essential beauty
story poses pertinent question entire maithil society why woman finished life much before man steps it? responsible immense tragic waste devastating human wreck? these two stories class apart
like great stories world give us feel james joyce calls “moments epiphany” sudden evanescent spiritual manifestation life’s truth
these moments epiphany akin ezra pound’s notion image flash insight best wordsworth
great story becomes image particular emotion every word overtly stated suggestively implied contributes effect
“a glimpse through” moment unfolds before us history millennium individual gives us feel entire humankind incident makes us aware vastness life itself
accomplishment words single emotion dramatic effect leaves us feeling having participated life movement world
modern short story writer any significant fragment life provides sufficient material work upon
observes minutely describes simply objectively end point made without apparent effort leaving reader thrilled emotionally disturbed spiritually enlightened
success story determined terms how efficiently conveys truth life through symbols archetypes
viewed light panch patra kanyak jeevan really great stories unfolding before us truthful pictures life drawn objectively
offer glimpse through individuals give us feel lower middle-class humanity widowed womanhood other
unlike stories pranamya devata there no intrusion personal element stories left stand their own speak themselves
epiphany flash vision image talked must stand itself complete objectivity like painting sculpture music without any attempt interpretation
artist just medium through white celestial light passes passage divine human must corrupted any personal hue
required possess “an almost christ-like quality self-abnegation” “negative capability” shakespeare enter truly joys sorrows other people
stories under consideration beautiful specimens writer’s self-effacement honest representation verisimilitude life
next three stories category namely maryadak bhang gram sevika graduate potohu reveal prof
jha champion “new woman”
these stories present bold emancipated young women taking charge duties hitherto denied them
situations these stories created such dexterous manner old values become ridiculously redundant new ones assert themselves
maryadak bhang daughter-in-law conservative maithil family boldly defies purdah comes out receive guest thus saving grace family being lost while elderly ladies house try hide behind cover
gram sevika story village worker impresses entire village her selfless social service wins heart even those critical her beginning
graduate putohu educated woman independent views coldly received her husband’s family her untimely death snakebite brings radical change their perspective woman
railak anubhav there juxtaposition two contrary scenes highlighting linguistic affinity among bengalis their exemplary love mother-tongue other revealing utter lack these among maithils
story poses relevant question asks us ponder why there such vast difference bengal mithila spite geographical proximity
padma kamla connote same thing then why there such difference their waters? these stories neatly crafted plots there total elimination personal element
intellectual element compelling us think improve social situation
message never made explicit artistically embedded plot story
besides these two major groups also third place prof
jha’s allegorical satires such brahmak shaap curse brahma babak samskar father’s funeral dwadas nidan twelve remedies kalaazarak upchar treatment kalaazar vinimya exchange
presented under garb allegorical story creation man brahmak shaap essentially subtle satire contentious nature maithils
babak samskar also makes successful use allegorical framework revealing real intent last sentence
seemingly story horrifying cruelty patricide import impatience maithili writers younger generation their older counterparts
probability story occasioned inhumanly harsh criticism prof
jha describing “stinking corpse” over-enthusiastic young writer perhaps hurry get himself established overnight great writer
stories like dwadas nidan kalaazarak upchar prof
jha moves out territory mithila focuses burning national issues
lashes government machinery especially bureaucracy exposing futility mad national projects high-level committees
vinimay offers frank candid picture practical form so-called modernity progressiveness show how repulsive
jha stories out sheer fun own delight taking holiday seriousness satire social criticism
remarkable inventive power capacity creating something highly enjoyable out nothing
these trick stories stories ingenuity verbal playfulness
category place such stories totama cure hiccup kalibarik chor thief kalibari darogajik monchh darogaji’s moustache alankar siksha lesson rhetoric pressak leela printer’s devil
totama kalibarik chor two memorable trick stories keep us glued text till very end
crescendo suspense ultimately leads anti-climax well maintained keeps us tenterhooks forcing us jump ahead conclusion
beauty originality darogajik monchh lie dexterously drafted letter gives meaning read part completely opposite meaning read full
our enjoyment story question how come letter torn frustration two exactly equal halves
pressak leela hilarious description how printer’s devil made estate pundit lose job
instance “learning while playing” alankar siksha relies solely verbal exercise use prose functional medium
supreme example verbal humour reveals inventive power prof
jha’s mind way sanskrit teacher shown use volley abuses among women house textbook give disciple lesson rhetoric
gives practical demonstration different figures speech identifying explaining every abuse idiom proverb hurled course wordy quarrel
view variety stories prof
jha attempted satirical sketches transcriptions allegories ingenious tales short story became hand highly flexible medium mould shape according personal requirements demands occasion
example rasmayik grahak subscribers rasmayi uses epistolary form give edge point
dramatizations transcriptions life combines quintessence greatest practitioners short story maupassant turgenev chekhov maugham
ease naturalness genius expressed itself comic well tragic moved ridiculous sublime remind us shakespeare’s myriad-mindedness
realistically drawn characters become part our memory names them gained currency common nouns
best stories parts himself manner great artists enter characters diverse tittir dai dev krishna
way throws personality off drowns himself joys sorrows characters almost shakespearean
exposition exploration characters combines attributes two contrary geniuses shaw shakespeare
like shakespeare again makes exploratory-creative use language exploits full resources native tongue
forge language own mould making words service command master
freed maithili prose bondage sanskrit made stand own bringing closer colloquial idiomatic speech-pattern
jha’s stories rooted mithila’s socio-cultural tradition prized treasure
true work fiction natural source subjectivity just aesthetic act also social
great writers shown concern interpreting flux life most prominently socio-cultural perspective
good story thus appeals us levels theme character event also social cultural levels
stories prof
jha stories mithila her strengths weaknesses her people actions habits customs rites rituals dress food-habits dogmas beliefs
give us smell her soil description events delineation characters their interactions colloquial idiom use
cherish memory her age-old cultural heritage also expose certain incongruities inconsistencies anomalies inherent various aspects her socio-cultural fabric customs superstitions religion morality
spite revolutionary spirit reformative zeal remains artist first last
perhaps why considered all-time great maithili literature
