contribution political moral philosophy rawls noted contributions liberal political philosophy
among ideas rawls's work received wide attention justice fairness original position reflective equilibrium overlapping consensus public reason veil ignorance there general agreement academia publication theory justice 1971 important revival following release academic study political philosophy
work crossed disciplinary lines receiving serious attention economists legal scholars political scientists sociologists healthcare resource allocators theologians
rawls unique distinction among contemporary political philosophers being frequently cited courts law united states canada referred practicing politicians united states united kingdom
philosophical thought rawls published three books
first theory justice focused distributive justice attempted reconcile competing claims values freedom equality
second political liberalism addressed question how citizens divided intractable religious philosophical disagreements come endorse constitutional democratic regime
third law peoples focused issue global justice
theory justice rawls's first work published 1971 aimed resolve seemingly competing claims freedom equality
shape rawls's resolution took however balancing act compromised weakened moral claim value compared other
rather intent show notions freedom equality integrated seamless unity called justice fairness
explaining proper perspective should take thinking justice rawls hoped show supposed conflict freedom equality illusory
original position rawls's theory justice 1971 includes thought experiment called original position
intuition motivating employment enterprise political philosophy will greatly benefited specification correct standpoint person should take her thinking justice
think mean just state affairs obtain persons eliminate certain features such hair eye color height race etc
fixate upon others
rawls's original position meant encode our intuitions features relevant irrelevant purposes deliberating well justice
original position rawls' hypothetical scenario group persons set task reaching agreement kind political economic structure want society will then occupy
each individual however deliberates behind veil ignorance each lacks knowledge example her gender race age intelligence wealth skills education religion
thing given member knows themselves possession basic capacities necessary fully willfully participate enduring system mutual cooperation each knows member society
rawls posits two basic capacities individuals know themselves possess
first each individual knows capacity form pursue revise conception good life plan
exactly sort conception good however individual does yet know
may example religious secular start individual original position does know
second each individual understands herself capacity develop sense justice generally effective desire abide
knowing these two features themselves group will deliberate order design social structure during each person will seek her maximal advantage
idea proposals ordinarily think unjust - such blacks women should allowed hold public office - will proposed rawls' original position because irrational propose them
presumably irrational since such criteria invisible behind curtains covering others
rawls develops original position modeling certain respects least after initial situations various social contract thinkers came before including thomas hobbes john locke jean-jacques rousseau
each social contractarian constructs his/her initial situation somewhat differently having mind unique political morality s/he intends thought experiment generate
iain king suggested original position draws rawls' experiences post-war japan us army challenged designing new social political authorities country while imagining away gone before
social justice processes each person early makes decisions features persons consider ignore
rawls's aspiration created thought experiment whereby version process carried completion illuminating correct standpoint person should take her thinking justice
succeeded then original position thought experiment may function full specification moral standpoint should attempt achieve deliberating social justice
reflective equilibrium despite amount attention received rawls's original position equally important concept reflective equilibrium
latter concept rawls's account how deliberation morality general justice particular should proceed serves metatheoretical frame within concept original position situated
reflective equilibrium essentially three-step process whereby identifies group considered judgments justice intuitions justice strike relatively secure such slavery religious persecution unjust 2 attempts explain justify these considered judgments discovering relatively abstract principles justice serve their foundation 3 addresses any lack fit principles arrived considered judgments justice other group started
give example suppose begin considered judgment restaurant's denying service person simply because black jewish unjust proceed account judgment principle says discrimination based upon nothing race unjust alternatively standpoint justice race morally irrelevant feature person
then suppose another considered conviction justice affirmative action let's say think race feature person institutions higher learning should take account their admissions procedures
my conception justice internally coherent will forced negotiate apparent conflict principle justice used account my initial considered judgment hand considered judgment principle conflicts other
rawls held there will inevitably give take person's first-order judgments justice higher order commitments take form principles justice
reflective equilibrium then name both ideal state person's considered convictions justice harmony their abstract principles justice procedure whereby state reached
there sense rawls's concept reflective equilibrium nothing other description our common sense method reasoning morality
rawls's explicit endorsement method cut against philosophical grain time least important respect amounts rejection absolute priority principles display work like robert nozick's anarchy state utopia 1974
work abstract moral principle introduced beginning work roughly plenary right individuals self-ownership property contract used bulldoze other moral intuitions such unjust employers discriminate based race unjust allow someone need emergency care die due their inability pay treatment
refusing privilege principles over concrete considered judgments rawls's concept reflective equilibrium may interpreted reaction against prophylactic principle-heavy arguments political philosophers past present
however added concept 'reflective equilibrium' well expression itself originally introduced nelson goodman's new riddle induction chapter 3 goodman's book fact fiction forecast
principles justice rawls derives two principles justice original position
first these liberty principle establishes equal basic liberties citizens
'basic' liberty entails familiar liberal tradition freedoms conscience association expression well democratic rights rawls also includes personal property right defended terms moral capacities self-respect rather appeal natural right self-ownership distinguishes rawls's account classical liberalism john locke libertarianism robert nozick
rawls argues second principle equality agreed upon guarantee liberties represent meaningful options society ensure distributive justice
example formal guarantees political voice freedom assembly little real worth desperately poor marginalized society
demanding everyone exactly same effective opportunities life almost certainly offend very liberties supposedly being equalized
nonetheless want ensure least fair worth our liberties wherever ends up society wants life worth living enough effective freedom pursue personal goals
thus participants moved affirm two-part second principle comprising fair equality opportunity famous controversial difference principle
second principle ensures those comparable talents motivation face roughly similar life chances inequalities society work benefit least advantaged
rawls held these principles justice apply basic structure fundamental social institutions such judiciary economic structure political constitution qualification source controversy constructive debate see work gerald cohen
rawls further argued these principles 'lexically ordered' award priority basic liberties over equality-oriented demands second principle
also topic much debate among moral political philosophers
finally rawls took approach applying first instance called well-ordered society
designed advance good members effectively regulated public conception justice
respect understood justice fairness contribution ideal theory determination principles characterize well-ordered society under favorable circumstances
much recent work political philosophy asked justice fairness might dictate indeed whether very useful problems partial compliance under nonideal theory
[citation needed] political liberalism political liberalism 1993 rawls turned towards question political legitimacy context intractable philosophical religious moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding human good
such disagreement insisted reasonable result free exercise human rationality under conditions open enquiry free conscience liberal state designed safeguard
question legitimacy face reasonable disagreement urgent rawls because own justification justice fairness relied upon kantian conception human good reasonably rejected
political conception offered theory justice shown good invoking controversial conception human flourishing unclear how liberal state ordered according possibly legitimate
intuition animating seemingly new concern actually no different guiding idea theory justice namely fundamental charter society must rely principles arguments reasons cannot reasonably rejected citizens whose lives will limited social legal political circumscriptions
other words legitimacy law contingent upon justification being impossible reasonably reject
old insight took new shape however rawls realized application must extend deep justification justice fairness itself presented terms reasonably rejectable kantian conception human flourishing free development autonomous moral agency
core political liberalism accordingly insistence order retain legitimacy liberal state must commit itself ideal public reason
roughly means citizens their public capacity must engage another terms reasons whose status reasons shared them
political reasoning then proceed purely terms public reasons
example supreme court justice deliberating whether denial homosexuals ability marry constitutes violation 14 th amendment's equal protection clause may advert religious convictions matter may take account argument same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions child's development
because reasons based upon interpretation sacred text non-public their force reasons relies upon faith commitments reasonably rejected whereas reasons rely upon value providing children environments may develop optimally public reasons their status reasons draws upon no deep controversial conception human flourishing
rawls held duty civility duty citizens offer another reasons mutually understood reasons applies within called public political forum
forum extends upper reaches government example supreme legislative judicial bodies society way down deliberations citizen deciding whom vote state legislatures how vote public referenda
campaigning politicians should also believed refrain pandering non-public religious moral convictions their constituencies
ideal public reason secures dominance public political values freedom equality fairness serve foundation liberal state
justification these values? since any such justification necessarily draw upon deep religious moral metaphysical commitments reasonably rejectable rawls held public political values may justified privately individual citizens
public liberal political conception attendant values may will affirmed publicly judicial opinions presidential addresses example deep justifications will
task justification falls rawls called reasonable comprehensive doctrines citizens subscribe them
reasonable catholic will justify liberal values way reasonable muslim another reasonable secular citizen yet another way
may illustrate rawls's idea using venn diagram public political values will shared space upon overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines
rawls's account stability presented theory justice detailed portrait compatibility kantian comprehensive doctrine justice fairness
hope similar accounts may presented many other comprehensive doctrines
rawls's famous notion overlapping consensus
such consensus necessarily exclude doctrines namely those unreasonable may wonder rawls say such doctrines
unreasonable comprehensive doctrine unreasonable sense incompatible duty civility
simply another way saying unreasonable doctrine incompatible fundamental political values liberal theory justice designed safeguard freedom equality fairness
answer question rawls say such doctrines nothing
thing liberal state cannot justify itself individuals such religious fundamentalists hold such doctrines because any such justification noted proceed terms controversial moral religious commitments excluded public political forum
importantly goal rawlsian project primarily determine whether liberal conception political legitimacy internally coherent project carried out specification sorts reasons persons committed liberal values permitted use their dialogue deliberations arguments another political matters
rawlsian project goal exclusion concern justifying liberal values those already committed least open them
rawls's concern whether idea political legitimacy fleshed out terms duty civility mutual justification serve viable form public discourse face religious moral pluralism modern democratic society justifying conception political legitimacy first place
rawls also modified principles justice follows first principle having priority over second first half second having priority over latter half each person equal claim fully adequate scheme basic rights liberties scheme compatible same scheme scheme equal political liberties those liberties guaranteed their fair value
social economic inequalities satisfy two conditions first attached positions offices open under conditions fair equality opportunity second greatest benefit least advantaged members society
these principles subtly modified principles theory
first principle now reads equal claim instead equal right also replaces phrase system basic liberties fully adequate scheme equal basic rights liberties
notably however switches two parts second principle difference principle becomes latter three
law peoples main article law peoples although there passing comments international affairs theory justice wasn't until late career rawls formulated comprehensive theory international politics publication law peoples
claimed there well-ordered peoples either liberal decent
rawls argued legitimacy liberal international order contingent tolerating decent peoples differ liberal peoples among other ways might state religions deny adherents minority faiths right hold positions power within state might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather elections
however no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights behave externally aggressive manner
peoples fail meet criteria liberal decent peoples referred outlaw states societies burdened unfavourable conditions benevolent absolutisms depending their particular failings
such peoples right mutual respect toleration possessed liberal decent peoples
rawls's views global distributive justice expressed work surprised many fellow egalitarian liberals
example charles beitz previously written study argued application rawls's difference principles globally
rawls denied principles should applied partly grounds states unlike citizens self-sufficient cooperative enterprises constitute domestic societies
although rawls recognized aid should given governments unable protect human rights economic reasons claimed purpose aid achieve eventual state global equality rather ensure these societies maintain liberal decent political institutions
argued among other things continuing give aid indefinitely see nations industrious populations subsidize those idle populations create moral hazard problem governments spend irresponsibly knowledge will bailed out those nations spent responsibly
rawls's discussion non-ideal theory other hand included condemnation bombing civilians american bombing german japanese cities world war ii well discussions immigration nuclear proliferation
also detailed here ideal statesman political leader looks next generation promotes international harmony even face significant domestic pressure act otherwise
rawls also controversially claimed violations human rights legitimize military intervention violating states though also expressed hope such societies induced reform peacefully good example liberal decent peoples
