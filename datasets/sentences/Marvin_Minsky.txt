1980 s minsky good shown how neural networks generated automatically—self replicated—in accordance any arbitrary learning program
artificial brains grown process strikingly analogous development human brain
any given case precise details never known even millions times too complex human understanding
early 1970 s mit artificial intelligence lab minsky papert started developing came called society mind theory
theory attempts explain how call intelligence product interaction non-intelligent parts
minsky says biggest source ideas theory came work trying create machine uses robotic arm video camera computer build children's blocks
1986 minsky published society mind comprehensive book theory unlike most previously published work written general audience

stated somewhere down line computers will become intelligent most people it's very hard predict how fast progress will
cautioned artificial superintelligence designed solve innocuous mathematical problem might decide take over earth's resources build supercomputers help achieve goal believed such negative scenarios hard take seriously because confident ai go through lot testing before being deployed
