words things gellner first encountered strong hold linguistic philosophy while balliol
publication 1959 words things first book gellner achieved fame even notoriety among fellow philosophers well outside discipline fierce attack ordinary language philosophy linguistic philosophy gellner's preferred phrase
ordinary language philosophy form another dominant approach oxbridge time although philosophers themselves denied part any unified school
first encountered strong ideological hold linguistic philosophy while balliol [a]t time orthodoxy best described linguistic philosophy inspired wittgenstein crystallizing seemed me totally utterly misguided
wittgenstein's basic idea there no general solution issues other custom community
communities ultimate
didn't put way amounted
doesn't make sense world communities stable clearly isolated each other
nevertheless wittgenstein managed sell idea enthusiastically adopted unquestionable revelation
very hard nowadays people understand atmosphere like then
wasn't doubted
quite obvious me wrong
obvious me moment came across although initially your entire environment bright people hold something true you assume you must wrong understanding properly must right
explored further finally came conclusion understand right rubbish indeed

nationalism main article gellner's theory nationalism 1983 gellner published nations nationalism
gellner nationalism primarily political principle holds political national unit should congruent
gellner argues nationalism appeared became sociological necessity modern world
previous times agro-literate stage history rulers little incentive impose cultural homogeneity ruled
modern society work becomes technical must operate machine such must learn
there need impersonal context-free communication high degree cultural standardisation
furthermore industrial society underlined fact there perpetual growth employment types vary new skills must learned
thus generic employment training precedes specialised job training
territorial level there competition overlapping catchment areas such alsace-lorraine
maintain grip resources survival progress state culture must these reasons congruent
nationalism therefore necessity
