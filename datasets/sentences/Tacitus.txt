i1 well known inde consilium mihi
sine ira et studio quorum causas procul habeo
my purpose relate
without either anger zeal motives am far removed
there much scholarly discussion tacitus' neutrality
throughout writing preoccupied balance power senate emperors increasing corruption governing classes rome adjusted ever-growing wealth power empire
tacitus's view senators squandered their cultural inheritance—that free speech—to placate their rarely benign emperor
tacitus noted increasing dependence emperor goodwill armies
julio-claudians eventually gave way generals followed julius caesar sulla pompey recognizing military might secure them political power rome
4 welcome death nero first burst joy yet roused various emotions rome among senators people soldiery capital also excited legions their generals now divulged secret empire emperors made elsewhere rome
tacitus's political career largely lived out under emperor domitian
experience tyranny corruption decadence era 81–96 may explain bitterness irony political analysis
draws our attention dangers power without accountability love power untempered principle apathy corruption engendered concentration wealth generated through trade conquest empire
nonetheless image builds tiberius throughout first six books annals neither exclusively bleak nor approving most scholars view image tiberius predominantly positive first books predominantly negative after intrigues sejanus
entrance tiberius first chapters first book dominated hypocrisy new emperor courtiers
later books respect evident cleverness old emperor securing position

interpunction linebreaks added clarity compared ciceronian period sentences usually length paragraph artfully constructed nested pairs carefully matched sonorous phrases short point
also very individual
note three different ways saying first line -que et ac especially matched second third lines
parallel sense sound pairs words ending
-is crossed over way deliberately breaks ciceronian conventions — however need acquainted see novelty tacitus' style
readers then now find teasing their expectations merely irritating
others find deliberate discord playing against evident parallelism two lines stimulating intriguing
historical works focus inner motivations characters often penetrating insight—though questionable how much insight correct how much convincing because rhetorical skill
best exposing hypocrisy dissimulation example follows narrative recounting tiberius' refusal title pater patriae recalling institution law forbidding any treasonous speech writings—and frivolous prosecutions resulted annals
elsewhere annals 4
