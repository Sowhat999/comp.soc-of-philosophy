thought minjok korean ethnic nationalism shin chae-ho extensively theory ethnic history sought challenge traditional border concepts korea encourage korean nationalism
theory broadly referred korean minjok 민족 民族188 early form minjok found article new history reader
6–7 shin's minjok works contested traditional conception korea geographically defined peninsular nation 반도 국 pandoguk born out politics associated mandate heaven classical chinese political philosophy
29 chinese hegemony interpreted sinocentric shin others placed border control hands chinese court
2729–30 shin's minjok historiographical work traced nation's history racial genealogy lineage relying heritable race culture
16 minjok defined terms history history shaped minjok hence these two concepts reciprocal inseparable
shin dismisses minjok there no history ignore down-play minjok devitalize history itself
within greater minjok history nation there host race chujok 주족 identification chujok necessary tracing authentic history nation solidified ethnocentric national history
korea chujok ancient korean-manchurian kingdom buyeo 부여 夫餘32 shin's estimate began 5000 years ago birth dangun legendary son bear transformed human god whanin
16 combining mythology genealogy common ancestry koreans manchurians traced effectively making them family
33 shin thereby attempted erase geographical border korea manchuria favour ethnic re-unification
231 distinct minjok state gukga 국가 國家 kukka
minjok basal concept gukga substantially change generations whereas gukga change kingdoms government rules
40 defining minjok rich powerful ethnic history shin constructed anti-imperialism anti-colonialism social defence
largely goal rejection both chinese japanese governmental oversight influence
42 contemporaneous japanese historians also argued koreans manchurians same group their efforts prove korea historically indistinct other nations thus mitigate korea's importance
30 social darwinism shin sometimes called social darwinist popular concept early 20 th century
within shin's work manchurian-korean buyeo minjok interpreted standard measure historical progress korea
34 shin described racial history conflict various races east asia well political history
towards progress shin's minjok project laid out terms racial victories specifically buyeo victory complete reunification race then-on defending against cultural assimilation imperialism
35 darwinian-spencerian framework prized ethnic nationalism purity allowed shin write race-centred history korea attempted shut down japanese colonial justifications conjoining ethnic history progress necessarily making harmful adulteration korean society japanese culture progressive
34–5 somewhat analogous nordicism progressivist ethnography korean-centric perspective
shin describe korea victor these racial battles
shin described slow fall minjok primarily attributing high point king muyeol silla then descent through fall barhae slow fracturing korean social unity through politics war
shin praised koryeo choseon dynasties insisted successes brought partial lamenting scholars searching full unification cannot found after tangun
35–6 juche shin chae-ho often credited primary source juche 주체 主體 meaning self-reliance autonomy sometimes spelt chuch'e political ideology
juche aspires towards country's complete autonomy both national sense historical sense
5 however clear whether north korean juche modelled upon merely similar shin's juche
270–2 scholars such sheila jager written strong references history north korean ideology uncommon similarities language symbolism concepts make shin chae-ho good candidate influence kim il sung own juche state ideology
5 shin's juche concept also specifically korean however bears likeness japanese kokutai 국체 kukche
135 anarchism shin chae-ho's anarchist philosophy largely ignored contemporary korean scholars
272 later works dream sky considered these anarchist-themed works explores themes clear understanding individual's own way praises human struggle righteous path
book also challenged literary standards ending ellipsis breaking historical continuity borrowing characters korean history
324–5 legacy south korea after emancipation japan shin considered important author
term minjok decried politically unacceptable shin's old acquaintance provisional government now first president south korea syngman rhee
new south korean government favoured term kukka implied loyalty republic korea over shin's minjok
1960 s rhee's political regime ended anti-imperialism sentiments redoubled followed scholars pursuing new autonomous history korea revived term minjok
1908 shin chae-ho become powerful figure korean historiography concepts like minjok among others interpreted ways favour south korean government over north's
40–1 park military regime south korea pushed capitalist economic development noting dismantling north korean communist state minjok saengjon good
following nationalist trends south korean minjung movements made appeals national self-reliance minjok juchesung
442–3 north korea also sponsored re-reading shin among other korean authors
democratic people's republic korea kim il sung leader minjok follows similar genealogical tracings koreans ancient korean-manchuria
39–40271 shin chae-ho held high esteem north korea112–3 made lasting impact korean perception japan imperialism generally
27 two works doksa sillon new reading history written 1908 joseon sanggosa early history joseon published 1931 particularly important nationalist historiography modern korea
4463 consequence shin's nationalistic thought might discouragement korean diaspora closer korean korean soil closer their cultural space
shin space culture patriotism became inseparable
239 worry koreans their ethno-cultural continuation loss korean-ness koreans either travel abroad adopt foreign customs
criticism standards education shin chae-ho's high standards education early enrollment children school age 4 criticized excessive
responded four-year-olds already knew first thousand characters chinese already begun children's first learning programme dongmong seonseup
also argued historical standards education steeper contemporary standards
453 while shin believed korean citizens should learn both hangeul hanja aid preserving korean identity rather subject themselves chinese language system study korean patriotic literature
458–9 concerns minjok thought part minjok historiography shin rebuked scholars focusing too much geography borders rather minjok ethnic boundaries called these scholars territorial historians
however own works consistently employed territorial terms boundaries borders differ how shin justified them very ancient korea while territorial historians' terms usually traced younger chinese courts
aggravated fact shin few any compelling references historical claims making boundaries largely arbitrary folk-history based
31 dream sky borrowed dante's divine comedy shin chae-ho's dream sky times resembles dante's divine comedy
shin knowingly presented korean-ized divine comedy authentic work korean fiction adulteration minjok historiography project shin's own standards ethno-cultural autonomy
whether shin even read dante's divine comedy purely speculative
