central themes writings throughout many works two themes stand out centrally hierarchical theory time theory time conflict much work interplay these themes whether played out disciplinary theatres sciences arts humanities history bridging principle fields enquiry themselves
arguably distinction disciplines diverse those epistemically belong natural human spheres knowledge find their methodological definitional norms informed hierarchical theory time
indeed work fits emerging cosmic evolution paradigm describing does how each level reality emerges how newly emergent level experiences time
fraser posits universe emerged levels temporality beginning pure energy big bang terms atemporality without-time
universe cooled quantum physical universe emerged giving rise probabilistic prototemporality
emergence molecules macrophysical objects get deterministic eotemporality
emergence living things gives rise forward direction time experience biotemporality followed strongly directional time experience human beings nootemporality
fraser then goes posit sociotemporality since emerged
fraser posits each level complexity universe encounters unresolvable paradoxes new level complexity emerges own paradoxes
these nested levels umwelts represent qualitatively different temporalities both time perception time evolved
sense time physically different universe first came being
universe continues change too does time change
humanistic sense perception time changed humans biologically evolved different concepts world those our ancestral species
biological evolution different perceptions time implies played out every moment our brain
