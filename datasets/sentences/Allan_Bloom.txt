bloom's last book dictated while hospital dying published posthumously love friendship offering interpretations meaning love
there ongoing controversy over bloom's semi-closeted homosexuality possibly culminating—as saul bellow’s thinly fictionalized account ravelstein—in death 1992 aids
bloom's friends deny homosexuality whether actually died aids remains disputed
philosophy substance my being informed books learned care
bloom's work easily categorized yet there thread links published material
concerned preserving philosophical way life future generations
strove through both scholarly popular writing
writings may placed two categories scholarly e
plato's republic popular political commentary e
closing american mind
surface valid distinction yet closer examinations bloom’s works reveal direct connection two types expression reflect view philosophy role philosopher political life
[citation needed] republic plato bloom’s translation interpretive essay republic plato published 1968
bloom previous translations lacking
particular bloom eager sweep away christian platonist layers coated translations scholarly analysis
1971 republic example long tradition philosophy tells us issues
sense familiarity may spurious may reading text seen tradition rather raising plato's own questions
school athens raphael up until late 20 th century most english language platonists following tradition blended christian theology plato
view named christian platonism interprets plato prophet coming christian age monotheist polytheist world
school socrates considered pre-christian saint tradition emphasizes socrates' goodness other-worldly attributes such accepting death like martyr
words george grant straussians say christianity led overextension soul
yet there developed different type platonism pagan platonism type bloom became aware most certainly adopted teacher leo strauss 1899–1973 most important representative thought past century
adherents significantly different view plato’s republic
strauss developed point view studying ancient islamic jewish theorists such al-farabi 870–950 moses maimonides 1135–1204
each philosopher faithful religion sought integrate classical political philosophy respectively islam judaism
islam prophet-legislator muhammad similarly jewish law function theology
thus these philosophers write great skill incorporating ideas plato aristotle many contradicted contravened islamic jewish thought practice without being seen challenge theology
according strauss al-farabi moses maimonides really writing potential philosophers within pious faithful
strauss calls discovery esoteric writing first presents possibility persecution art writing 1952
christianity differed these faiths philosophy free establish foothold christendom without necessarily being seen heretical
think saint augustine 354–430 city god free will
strauss took insight applied eventually plato’s writings themselves
bloom's translation essay republic takes stance therefore radically different many important aspects previous translations interpretations republic
most notable bloom's discussion socratic irony
fact irony key bloom’s take republic see discussion books ii–vi republic
allan bloom says philosopher immune irony because see tragic comic comic tragic
bloom refers socrates philosopher par excellence interpretative essay stating socrates go naked others go clothed afraid ridicule
also contemplate sexual intercourse others stricken terror afraid moral indignation
other words treats comic seriously tragic lightly
thus irony republic refers just city speech bloom looks model future society nor template human soul rather city presented ironically example distance philosophy every potential philosopher
bloom follows strauss suggesting just city speech natural man-made
