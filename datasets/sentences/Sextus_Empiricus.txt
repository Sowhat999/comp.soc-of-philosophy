philosophy sextus empiricus raised concerns applied types knowledge
doubted validity induction long before best known critic david hume raised regress argument against forms reasoning those claim themselves judge truth bound possess criterion truth
criterion then either without judge's approval approved
without approval whence comes truthworthy? no matter dispute trusted without judging
approved approves turn either approved approved ad infinitum
because these other barriers acquiring true beliefs sextus empiricus advises should suspend judgment virtually beliefs say should neither affirm any belief true nor deny any belief false
view known pyrrhonian skepticism distinguished academic skepticism practiced carneades according sextus denies knowledge altogether
sextus deny possibility knowledge
criticizes academic skeptic's claim nothing knowable being affirmative belief
instead sextus advocates simply giving up belief other words suspending judgment whether anything knowable
suspending judgment attain state ataraxia roughly 'peace mind'
sextus think such general suspension judgment impractical since may live without any beliefs acting habit
sextus allowed might affirm claims our experience e
reports our feelings sensations
claim x feel perceive true say seems me now x
however pointed out does imply any objective knowledge external reality
though might know honey eat certain moment tastes sweet me merely subjective judgment such may tell me anything true honey itself
interpretations sextus's philosophy along above lines advocated scholars such myles burnyeat jonathan barnes benson mates
michael frede however defends different interpretation according sextus does allow beliefs long derived reason philosophy speculation skeptic may example accept common opinions skeptic's society
important difference skeptic dogmatist skeptic does hold beliefs result rigorous philosophical investigation
against ethicists sextus fact directly says skeptic does conduct life according philosophical theory far regards inactive regards non-philosophical regulation life capable desiring things avoiding others
xi 165
thus interpretation per sextus' own words skeptic may well entertain belief god does does exist virtue good
she will believe such claims true basis reasons since far skeptic aware no reason assenting such claims yet shown any credible reasons their denial
xix must also remembered dogma sextus means assent something non-evident [ἄδηλος adēlos] ph 16
non-evident means things lie beyond appearances thus beyond proof disproof such existence and/or nature causality time motion even proof itself
thus skeptic will example believe proposition dion room sense-data ordinary reasoning led emergence such belief
other hand she strongly assert dion really room then she may met opposing arguments equal psychological force against self-same proposition experience mental disquietude result
thus pyrrhonian does assent proposition dion room dogmatic way purport describe non-evident reality lies beyond appearance [φαινόμενον phainomenon] dion being room
skeptic simply goes along appearance just child persuaded
ph 229
reason then sextus says skeptic lives undogmatically accordance appearances also according fourfold regimine life includes guidance nature compulsion pathe feelings laws customs instruction arts crafts
skeptic follows course life while suspending judgment concerning ultimate truth non-evident matters debated philosophy sciences ph 17
thus pyrrhonian skeptic believes possibly many things yet does dogmatize those beliefs since she finds no ultimate justification them
thus pyrrhonian achieves ataraxia casting certain judgments appearances rather through her refined ability oppose appearances judgments such she brought firstly state mental suspense next state 'unperturbedness' 'quietude
iv ten modes pyrrhonism pyrrhonism mental attitude therapy theory
involves setting things opposition owing equipollence objects reasons suspends judgement
oppose either appearances appearances objects thought objects thought alternando
ten modes induce suspension judgement turn state mental suspense followed ataraxia
ever position unable refute theory pyrrhonists reply just before birth founder school you belong theory holds yet apparent sound theory although really existence likewise possible opposite theory you now propound already really existent though yet apparent us ought yet yield assent theory moment seems valid
these ten modes tropes originally listed aenesidemus
same impressions produced same objects owing differences animals
same impressions produced same objects owing differences among human beings
same impressions produced same objects owing differences among senses
owing circumstances conditions dispositions same objects appear different
same temperature established instrument feels very different after extended period cold winter weather after mild weather autumn
time appears slow young fast aging proceeds
honey tastes sweet most bitter someone jaundice
person influenza will feel cold shiver even though she hot fever
based positions distances locations owing each these same objects appear different
same tower appears rectangular close distance round far away
moon looks like perfect sphere human eye yet cratered view telescope
“we deduce since no object strikes us entirely itself along something else may perhaps possible say mixture compounded out external object thing perceived like able say external object like itself
based quantity constitution underlying objects meaning generally constitution manner composition
example goat horn appears black intact appears white ground up
snow appears white frozen translucent liquid
since things appear relative will suspend judgement things exist absolutely really existent
things exist differentially opposed those things distinct existence their own differ relative things not? differ then too relative differ then since everything differs relative something
things exist absolutely relative
based constancy rarity occurrence
sun amazing comet because see feel warmth sun daily comet rarely latter commands our attention
there tenth mode mainly concerned ethics being based rules conduct habits laws legendary beliefs dogmatic conceptions
superordinate these ten modes stand three other modes based subject judges modes 2 3 & 4
ii based object judged modes 7 & 10
iii based both subject judges object judged modes 5 6 & 9 superordinate these three modes mode relation
