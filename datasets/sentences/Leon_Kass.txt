president's philosopher stem cell controversy brewed late 1990 s 2001 president george w
bush decide whether allow federal funding research stem cells derived embryos
many scientists advocating removal limits embryonic stem cell research critics expressed concern characterized wanton destruction human life
august 2001 speech bush announced support funding research stem cell lines already created—where life death decision already made—but lines created further destruction embryos
because [e]mbryonic stem cell research leading edge series moral hazards bush create president's council bioethics led kass mandate monitor stem cell research recommend appropriate guidelines regulations consider medical ethical ramifications biomedical innovation
council appointed prepared begin meeting early 2002 kass received great deal media attention especially due reputation pessimism concern moral implications scientific progress respect health life issues
calling president's philosopher u
news world report noted tends dwell dark side modern medicine
kass tried raise public's consciousness emerging technology's risks values humanity holds dear
council inception charged bush consider these larger questions well beyond domain stem cell research
first specific task council according executive order creating undertake fundamental inquiry human moral significance developments biomedical behavioral science technology
composition council also subject controversy
kass accused stacking deck philosophers scientists public intellectuals likely oppose unfettered medical research area stem cells therapeutic cloning reproductive cloning
given fact researchers better worry lot council likely recommend president
critics also charged kass eliminated those disagreed such elizabeth blackburn william may[disambiguation needed] replacing them opponents cloning
kass replied these criticisms saying council intellectually diverse prior bioethics commissions precisely because included opponents abortion
previous commissions excluded representatives right life movement
also council members robert george francis fukuyama james q
wilson debated stark disagreement their opposing points view biological status human embryo came no agreed conclusions
since bush deliberately created council debate clarify issues without necessarily reaching consensus kass welcomed disagreement within council council easily most intellectually ethically diverse bioethics commissions date
worked mutual respect while papering over our differences
no attended any our meetings read transcripts believe anything serious careful work without regard ideology partisan politics religious beliefs
council renewed executive order every two years since 2001 subjects considered ranged beyond stem cell battles during established
kass sought throughout develop richer bioethics attentive larger human philosophical questions root bioethical dilemmas lamented council pigeonholed council came existence identified 'stem cell council' people sides embryo research debate seem care council's views subject anything else
our choice—and certainly mine—the council born smack middle 'embryoville' never able leave highly political field
despite public's narrow conception work during kass's chairmanship council produced five book-length reports white paper humanistic reader ten topics generally neglected bioethics literature
kass described council's work public bioethics rejecting previous approaches favored government self-appointed experts—scientific bioethical—and presenting issues terms accessible broader public political representatives
sought richer inquiry debates ends well means council's reports addressed larger human questions merely administrative regulatory ones
presented sides ethical issues order create substantive moral discourse
proper bioethics must lead public reflection ways new biotechnologies may affect those things matter most regarding how human lives lived kass
means beginning reflecting upon highest human goods understanding latest technological advances light
eschewing much language theoretical framework academic bioethics kass drew literary philosophical theological sources inform council's discussion
council's first meeting led discussion birth-mark short story nathaniel hawthorne
kass stepped down chairman council october 2005 remained member council until 2007
returned positions american enterprise institute university chicago
views bioethics biotechnology medical enhancement while welcoming biotechnology therapeutic promise—to cure disease relieve suffering restore health wholeness—kass worries uses enhancement boosting capability beyond given naturally even altering human nature
while biotechnology offers great promise health care applications many other ends good ones bad
biotechnology employed produce better children superior performance ageless bodies happy souls
kass argues biotechnology may eventually used substitute virtue hard work study love order fulfill our deepest human desires end lowering reach those desires those objects realized technologically
worries biotechnology stem calls technological disposition transforms meaning character human life believing aspects life rationally mastered through technique
stem cell research kass consistent critic embryo research including embryonic stem cell research because exploitation destruction nascent human life
although claims agnostic moral standing early human embryo worries treating human life whatever stage merely natural resource
there something deeply repugnant fundamentally transgressive such utilitarian treatment prospective human life writes
because recognized potential such cells medical research led president's council bioethics examine alternative avenues obtaining pluripotent stem cells pluripotent cells might obtainable already dead just unwanted doomed actually dead embryos whose individual cells might nonetheless still viable living embryos nondestructive biopsy bioengineered embryo-like artifacts reprogrammed body cells taken children adults induced return undifferentiated state pluripotency
should hopeful technological solution our moral dilemma might soon found divisive piece our recent political history will soon come end
2007 two separate studies research teams led james thomson shinya yamanaka created induced pluripotent stem cells adult cells meaning destruction embryos stem cells might no longer necessary
2009 reprogramming technique further improved skin cells returned pluripotency transfer few exogeneous genes without use foreign viruses vectors
robert p
george praised kass driving intellectual force against embryo-killing favor finding alternative methods obtaining pluripotent stem cells along dr
kass reprogramming methods pursued vigorously enable us realize full benefits stem cell science while respecting human dignity
human cloning kass supports universal ban cloning humans grounds cloning affront morality human dignity
1997 article new republic entitled wisdom repugnance kass suggests should respect revulsion most people feel cloning human beings just respect their supposed revulsion incest cannibalism
crucial cases writes repugnance emotional expression deep wisdom beyond reason's power fully articulate
kass writes modern ethical discourse emphasizes autonomy equity utility fails provide moral guidance modern world demands repugnance here elsewhere revolts against excesses human willfulness warning us transgress unspeakably profound
indeed age everything held permissible long freely done our given human nature no longer commands respect our bodies regarded mere instruments our autonomous rational wills repugnance may voice left speaks up defend central core our humanity
shallow souls forgotten how shudder
society tolerates cloning kass writes forgotten how shudder [and] rationalizes away abominable
society allows cloning whether knows tacitly yes converting procreation manufacture treating our children pure projects our will
yet contrary claims critics kass’s moral views rely solely feelings advances multiple arguments against cloning babies centering concern children family ties dignity human procreation
argues cloning constitutes unethical experiment upon resulting child-to-be creates confusions identity individuality turns begetting making giving parents control over child's genetic make-up exacerbates dangerous idea parental control over children's lives prospects
must never forget these human beings upon whom our eugenic merely playful fantasies enacted writes
concern natural although appreciates human beings modifying naturally given kass worries lack standards human life world human nature treated utterly malleable boundaries human life eroded
kass places special value natural human cycle birth procreation death views death necessary desirable end human human aspirations derived
views human mortality blessing disguise opposed deliberate efforts increase maximum human life expectancy pursuit biological immortality
kass early critic widespread use reproductive technologies like vitro fertilization partly because concerned their use obscures truths essence human life society embedded natural reproductive process
later endorsed marital use vitro after louise brown born 1978
kass sees human cloning natural progression decoupling sex procreation begun vitro fertilization cloning turns out perfect embodiment ruling opinions our new age
thanks sexual revolution able deny practice increasingly thought inherent procreative teleology sexuality itself
sex no intrinsic connection generating babies babies need no necessary connection sex
new dispensation clone ideal emblem ultimate 'single-parent child
other writings kass emphasizes connection reproduction marriage family life no child conceived aid assisted reproductive technologies should denied lineage biological ties two parents children born 'naturally'
no child should say 'an embryo my father
philosophical studies much career kass's scholarship moved away practical issues bioethics issues human nature human good nearly teaching chicago these topics
yet despite stated interest natural kass does hold any traditional teaching natural law does derive any moral rules nature
rather sees human nature offering most intimations pointings toward human flourishing human fulfillment pointings need both cultural encouragement cultural restraint humans become upright animal advertised special posture
