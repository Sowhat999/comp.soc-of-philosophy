argues property natural right derived labour
chapter v second treatise locke argues individual ownership goods property justified labour exerted produce those goods utilise property produce goods beneficial human society
locke stated belief second treatise nature own provides little value society implying labour expended creation goods gives them their value

unlike thomas hobbes locke believed human nature characterised reason tolerance
like hobbes locke believed human nature allowed people selfish
apparent introduction currency
natural state people equal independent everyone natural right defend life health liberty possessions
most scholars trace phrase life liberty pursuit happiness american declaration independence locke's theory rights though other origins suggested
like hobbes locke assumed sole right defend state nature enough people established civil society resolve conflicts civil way help government state society
however locke never refers hobbes name may instead responding other writers day
locke also advocated governmental separation powers believed revolution right obligation circumstances
these ideas come profound influence declaration independence constitution united states
limits accumulation see also lockean proviso according locke unused property waste offence against nature introduction durable goods men exchange their excessive perishable goods goods last longer thus offend natural law
view introduction money marks culmination process making possible unlimited accumulation property without causing waste through spoilage
also includes gold silver money because may hoarded up without injury anyone since spoil decay hands possessor
view introduction money eliminates limits accumulation
locke stresses inequality come tacit agreement use money social contract establishing civil society law land regulating property
locke aware problem posed unlimited accumulation does consider task
just implies government function moderate conflict unlimited accumulation property nearly equal distribution wealth does identify principles government should apply solve problem
however elements thought form consistent whole
example labour theory value two treatises government stands side side demand-and-supply theory developed letter titled considerations consequences lowering interest raising value money
moreover locke anchors property labour end upholds unlimited accumulation wealth
price theory locke's general theory value price supply demand theory set out letter member parliament 1691 titled considerations consequences lowering interest raising value money
refers supply quantity demand rent
price any commodity rises falls proportion number buyer sellers regulates price
[of goods] nothing else their quantity proportion their rent
quantity theory money forms special case general theory
idea based money answers things ecclesiastes rent money sufficient enough varies very little
locke concludes far money concerned demand exclusively regulated quantity regardless whether demand money unlimited constant
also investigates determinants demand supply
supply explains value goods based their scarcity ability exchanged consumed
explains demand goods based their ability yield flow income
locke develops early theory capitalisation such land value because constant production saleable commodities brings certain yearly income
considers demand money almost same demand goods land depends whether money wanted medium exchange
medium exchange states money capable exchange procure us necessaries conveniences life loanable funds comes same nature land yielding certain yearly income
monetary thoughts locke distinguishes two functions money counter measure value pledge lay claim goods
believes silver gold opposed paper money appropriate currency international transactions
silver gold says treated equal value humanity thus treated pledge anyone while value paper money valid under government issues
locke argues country should seek favourable balance trade lest fall behind other countries suffer loss trade
since world money stock grows constantly country must constantly seek enlarge own stock
locke develops theory foreign exchanges addition commodity movements there also movements country stock money movements capital determine exchange rates
considers latter less significant less volatile commodity movements
country's money stock large relative other countries says will cause country's exchange rise above par export balance
also prepares estimates cash requirements different economic groups landholders labourers brokers
each group posits cash requirements closely related length pay period
argues brokers middlemen whose activities enlarge monetary circuit whose profits eat earnings labourers landholders negative influence both personal public economy supposedly contribute
self locke defines self conscious thinking thing whatever substance made up whether spiritual material simple compounded matters sensible conscious pleasure pain capable happiness misery concerned itself far consciousness extends
does however ignore substance writing body too goes making man
essay locke explains gradual unfolding conscious mind
arguing against both augustinian view man originally sinful cartesian position holds man innately knows basic logical propositions locke posits empty mind tabula rasa shaped experience sensations reflections being two sources our ideas
locke's thoughts concerning education outline how educate mind expresses belief education maketh man fundamentally mind empty cabinet statement think may say men meet nine parts ten good evil useful their education
locke also little almost insensible impressions our tender infancies very important lasting consequences
argued associations ideas makes young important those made later because foundation self put differently first mark tabula rasa
essay both these concepts introduced locke warns against example letting foolish maid convince child goblins sprites associated night darkness shall ever afterwards bring those frightful ideas shall joined no bear other
theory came called associationism strongly influenced 18 th-century thought particularly educational theory nearly every educational writer warned parents allow their children develop negative associations
also led development psychology other new disciplines david hartley's attempt discover biological mechanism associationism observations man 1749
religious beliefs scholars seen locke's political convictions deriving religious beliefs
locke's religious trajectory began calvinist trinitarianism time reflections 1695 locke advocating just socinian views tolerance also socinian christology
however wainwright 1987 notes posthumously published paraphrase 1707 locke's interpretation verse ephesians 110 markedly different socinians like biddle may indicate near end life locke returned nearer arian position thereby accepting christ's pre-existence
fact historian john marshall suggests locke's view christ ended somewhere socianism arianism
locke times sure subject original sin accused socianism arianism deism
deny reality evil
man capable waging unjust wars committing crimes
criminals punished even death penalty
regard bible locke very conservative
retained doctrine verbal inspiration scriptures
miracles proofs divine nature biblical message
locke convinced entire content bible agreement human reason reasonableness christianity 1695
although locke advocate tolerance urged authorities tolerate atheism because thought denial god's existence undermine social order lead chaos
excluded atheistic varieties philosophy attempts deduce ethics natural law purely secular premises example man's autonomy dignity human flourishing
locke's opinion cosmological argument valid proved god's existence
political thought based particular set protestant christian assumptions
locke's concept man started belief creation
sent world [god's] order business [we] property whose workmanship [we] made last during anothers pleasure
like two other very influential natural-law philosophers hugo grotius samuel pufendorf locke equated natural law biblical revelation since their view both originated god therefore contradict each other
philosopher locke intensely interested christian doctrine reasonableness insisted most men hope understand detailed requirements law nature without assistance teachings example jesus
locke derived fundamental concepts political theory biblical texts particular genesis 2 creation decalogue exodus 20 golden rule matthew 712 teachings jesus e
doctrine charity matthew 1919 letters paul apostle
decalogue ten commandments puts person's life her honourable reputation
honour dignity property under god's protection
freedom another major theme old testament
instance god's actions liberating israelites egyptian slavery decalogue's prologue exodus 202 precondition following commandments
moreover locke derived basic human equality including equality sexes adam eve genesis 126–28 starting point theological doctrine imago dei
locke consequences principle equality humans created equally free therefore governments needed consent governed
locke derived fundamental aspects concept man ethics biblical texts life equality private property etc
examine philosopher consequences abovementioned way
following locke american declaration independence founded human rights biblical belief creation men created equal
endowed their creator certain unalienable rights
