striking conclusion their research regarded way money supply fluctuations contribute economic fluctuations
several regression studies david meiselman during 1960 s suggested primacy money supply over investment government spending determining consumption output
these challenged prevailing largely untested view their relative importance
friedman's empirical research theory supported conclusion short-run effect change money supply primarily output longer-run effect primarily price level
friedman main proponent monetarist school economics
maintained there close stable association inflation money supply mainly inflation avoided proper regulation monetary base's growth rate
famously used analogy dropping money out helicopter
order avoid dealing money injection mechanisms other factors overcomplicate models

due reformulation story theory new classical phillips curve embedded radically changed
modification however significant effect friedman’s own approach result theory friedmanian phillips curve also changed

however argued many services performed government performed better private sector
above public goods provided state believed should legal monopoly private competition prohibited example there no way justify our present public monopoly post office
