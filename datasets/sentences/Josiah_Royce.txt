university california berkeley moved oakland berkeley during matriculation 1875 later accepted instructorship teaching english composition literature rhetoric
after time germany studied hermann lotze johns hopkins university awarded 1878 first four doctorates philosophy
johns hopkins taught course history german thought “one chief interests” because able give consideration philosophy history
after four years university california berkeley went harvard 1882 sabbatical replacement william james once royce's friend philosophical antagonist
royce's position harvard made permanent 1884 remained there until death september 14 1916
historiography royce stands out starkly philosophical crowd because major american philosopher spent significant period life studying writing history specifically american west
“as four giants american philosophy time […] royce overshadowed himself historian both reputation output” pomeroy 2
during first three years harvard royce taught many different subjects such english composition forensics psychology philosophy other professors
although eventually settled writing philosophy early adulthood characterized wide-ranging interests during novel investigated paranormal phenomena skeptic published significant body literary criticism
historian philosopher distinguish himself
royce spread himself too thin however 1888 suffered nervous breakdown required take leave absence duties

publication 1885 religious aspect philosophy 1892 spirit modern philosophy both based harvard lectures secured place philosophical world
former these contained new proof existence god based upon reality error
errors judged erroneous comparison total truth royce argued must either hold ourselves infallible accept even our errors evidence world truth
having made clear idealism depends upon postulates proceeds hypothetically royce defends necessity objective reference our ideas universal whole within belong without these postulates “both practical life commonest results theory simplest impressions most valuable beliefs most us utterly impossible”

371 pushes ahead spite difficulty offer best account manage
stance called fallibilism philosophers generation royce's embrace may attributed influence charles sanders peirce william james
royce also defends view later called personalism—i
“the ambiguous relation conscious individuals universal thought
will decided sense their inclusion elements universal thought
will indeed become 'things dream' any other person themselves their whole reality just exactly them will found fragment higher reality
reality will no power nor will produce individuals dreaming them will complete existence them separate beings no rational completeness”
rap pp
380–381 unavoidable hypothesis royce believed moral religious aspect point existence absolute
absolutism temporalism “absolute royce defended quite different ideas georg wilhelm friedrich hegel f
royce’s absolute ground originator community personal temporal being preserves past entirety sustains full present act interpretation anticipates every possibility future infusing these possibilities value ideal community
principal difference royce’s absolute similar idea held other thinkers temporal personal character interpretive activity
divine activity royce increasingly came see terms notion suggested charles sanders peirce “agapism” “evolutionary love”
royce believed human beings experience absolute irrevocability each every deed
confront way our acts cannot undone meet absolute temporal necessity
philosophical idea absolute inevitable hypothesis coherent system thought royce argued practical purposes meaningful ethical life human beings need ongoing will interpret
temporal ground acts interpretation interpreter spirit another name absolute philosophical understanding such being required successful interpretation ethical life
conception god debate benchmark royce’s career thought occurred returned california speak philosophical union berkeley ostensibly defend concept god criticisms george holmes howison joseph le conte sidney mezes meeting new york times called “a battle giants”
there royce offered new modal version proof reality god based upon ignorance rather error based upon fragmentariness individual existence rather epistemological uncertainty
however howison attacked royce’s doctrine having left no ontological standing individual over against absolute rendering royce's idealism kind pernicious impersonalism according howison
royce never intended result responded howison’s criticism first long supplementary essay debate 1897 then developing philosophy individual person greater detail gifford lectures published under title world individual 1899 1901
simultaneously royce enduring resolute assault hypothetical absolutism james
royce later admitted engagement philosophy bradley may led robust engagement absolute warranted might added persistent reading spinoza might similar effects
world individual first series gifford lectures made case against three historical conceptions being called “realism” “mysticism” “critical rationalism” royce defended “fourth conception being”
realism according royce held independent mysticism critical rationalism advanced other criteria way immediacy case mysticism objective validity critical rationalism
hypotheses fundamental character being royce shows each these falls contradiction
contrast royce offers hypothesis “to uniquely related whole”
formulation preserves three crucial aspects being namely whole individual relation constitutes them
previously royce’s hypotheses ontology taken granted relations discovered analysis terms here moves recognition terms constituted their relations insofar terms taken refer entities must assume obliged think individuals uniquely constituted totality relations other individuals whole theirs alone
second series gifford lectures royce temporalizes these relations showing learn think ideas like succession space noting differences directionality within unified variable “time’spans” qualitative durational episodes “specious present”
royce explains “our temporal form experience thus peculiarly form will such”
world individual second series p
124 hence royce will inner dynamism reaches beyond itself possible future acts upon acknowledged past
space abstract descriptions appropriate falsification dynamism metaphysical error especially “realism” proceeds taking these abstractions literally
philosophy itself proceeds along descriptive lines therefore must offer ontology kind fiction
ideas considered dynamically temporally instead spatially light world practice qualities temporal forms activities
narrative presentation ideas such belongs world appreciation “more easily effective description
space furnishes indeed stage scenery universe world’s play occurs time”
wi2 pp
time conceived abstractly world description although never wholly spatialized provides us idea eternity while time lived experienced grounds description every other historically ethically aesthetically
since philosophy proceeds descriptively rather narratively “the real world our idealism viewed us men temporal order” “purposes fulfilled finite internal meanings reach their final expression attain unity external meanings”
hence royce limitation conceptual thought obliges us philosophize according logic rather integrating our psychological appreciated experience our philosophical doctrines
there ample evidence supposing parallelism our conceptual perceptual experiences using former guide latter according royce particularly regard way idealization our inner purposes enables us connect them purposes others larger whole no immediate experience
appreciate sense fulfillment find serving larger whole form our characters progressively upon ways those experiences fulfillment point us outwards beyond finite self constitute experience greater whole our experiences belong
cannot help supposing there experiencer within whose inner life whole exists inevitability assumption any experiential content assures us reality such experiencer
philosophy loyalty social metaphysics lays groundwork royce’s philosophy loyalty
book title published 1908 derived lectures given lowell institute yale harvard university illinois 1906–07
basic ideas explicit writings early history california
here royce set out most original important moral philosophies recent history philosophy
notion “loyalty” essentially universalized ecumenical interpretation christian agapic love
broadly speaking royce’s virtue ethic our loyalty increasingly less immediate ideals becomes formative moral influence our personal development
persons become increasingly able form loyalties practical ongoing devotion cause bigger themselves these loyalties become unifiable higher purposes groups persons over many generations humanity increasingly better able recognize highest ideal creation perfected “beloved community” each every person shares
beloved community ideal experienced our acts loyal service integrates royce’s moral philosophy kingdom ends construed immanent operative instead transcendental regulative
while philosophical status ideal remains hypothetical living fulfillment our finite purposes concretizes each every individual
each us no matter how morally undeveloped may fulfilled experiences point reality experience beyond given us personally
wider reality exemplified most commonly fall love
“spiritual union [of lovers] also personal conscious existence upon higher human level
analogous unity consciousness unity superhuman grade intimately bound up inclusive our separate personalities must exist loyalty well founded wherever real cause wins true devotion ourselves
grant such hypothesis then loyalty becomes no pathetic serving myth
good our causes possesses then also becomes concrete fact experience higher human level”
philosophy loyalty p
move illustrates royce calls “absolute pragmatism” claim ideals thoroughly practical—the inclusive being practical
concretization ideals cannot therefore empirically doubted except cost rendering our conscious life inexplicable
admit concretization ideals genuinely occurs royce argues then entitled compelled take seriously regard real larger intelligible structures within those ideals exist purposive character divine will
way persons sort out higher lower causes examining whether one’s service destroys loyalty others best them
ultimately personal character reaches acme recognition service lost causes through may learn our ultimate loyalty loyalty itself
problem christianity final phase royce’s thought involved application further illustration concepts defended since 1881
seen here fundamental shift royce’s thinking evidence far conclusive
royce’s hypothetical ontology temporalism personalism social metaphysics based fourth conception being remain along operation agapic loyalty unity finite purposes ideal beloved community
there no obvious shift method no overt move abandon idealism
royce himself declared “successive expressions” philosophy loyalty “form consistent body ethical well religious opinion teaching verifiable main outlines terms human experience capable furnishing foundation defensible form metaphysical idealism”
problem christianity vol
ix royce never old-style absolutist either method ontology there those among peers came recognize later thought
these believed changed view fundamental way
royce’s ethics religious philosophy certainly matured basic philosophical framework shift
having provided throughout career idealistic way grasping will contrast schopenhauer’s pessimistic treatment remained royce rescue pauline christianity universalized modernized form critique nietzsche others tended understand will terms power claimed historic doctrine no longer believable modern mind
striking work temporal account holy spirit holy catholic church communion saints universal community
community process mutually interpretive activity requires shared memory hope
seeking show reality invisible community perhaps royce seeking communion departed son christopher close friend william james both whom died 1910
royce kept these other personal tragedies far text published work grieving certainly affected deepened insight perhaps exaggerated quality hope
