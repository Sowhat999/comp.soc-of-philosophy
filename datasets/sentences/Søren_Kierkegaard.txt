‘christendom’ christian movement does reflect oneself christianity reflects oneself out something else becomes simply christian

soren kierkegaard point view my work author lowrie 53 144 153-155 kierkegaard's manuscript sickness unto death second edition either/or published early 1849
later year published sickness unto death under pseudonym anti-climacus
he's against johannes climacus kept writing books trying understand christianity
here says let others admire praise person pretends comprehend christianity
regard plain ethical task perhaps requiring little self-denial these speculative times ‘the others’ busy comprehending-to admit neither able nor supposed comprehend
sickness unto death familiar phrase kierkegaard's earlier writings
sickness despair kierkegaard despair sin
despair impossibility possibility
kierkegaard writes person addicted sin other over considerable period now successfully resisted temptation-when person relapse succumbs again temptation then depression ensues no means sorrow over sin
something quite different might also matter resentment divine governance latter let fall temptation should hard seeing until now long successfully resisted temptation
such person protests perhaps even stronger terms how relapse tortures torments how brings despair swears 'i will never forgive myself
never forgives himself-but suppose god forgive then might well goodness forgive himself

later 20 th century reception 1955 morton white word exists kierkegaard's idea god's is-ness
word “exists” most pivotal controversial philosophy
philosophers think having meaning sense say book exists god does does exist there exist odd numbers 20 characteristic like redness exists well things red american government exists well physical building government housed minds exist well bodies
word “exists” construed unambiguous way many famous disputes history philosophy theology appear quite straightforward
theists affirm god exists while atheists deny very same statement materialists say matter exists while idealists think illusory nominalists called deny existence characteristics like redness while platonic realists affirm kinds behaviorists deny there minds inside bodies
there however tendency among philosophers insist word “exists” ambiguous therefore these disputes disputes merely results mutual misunderstanding failure see certain things exist sense while others exist another
outstanding efforts kind twentieth century occurs early writings realists maintained concrete things space time exist while abstract characteristics things relations them should subsist
sometimes illustrated pointing out while chicago st
louis both exist definite places relation populous holds them exists neither chicago nor st
louis nor area them nevertheless something speak something usually assigned timeless spaceless realm like plato spoke
view however human minds personalities also exist spite being non-material
short great divide abstract subsistents concrete existents both human personalities physical objects existents share spacelessness timelessness platonic ideas
far see kierkegaard too distinguishes different senses “exists” except appears need least three distinct senses should supply three distinct words
first needs statements god says god
secondly contrast persons personalities exist
appear then needs third term physical objects view very different god persons since existentialists don’t seem very interested physical objects “mere” things appear get along two
great problem kierkegaard relate god’s is-ness may use term moment human existence tries solve appealing incarnation
christ’s person existent outgrowth god
admittedly mysterious process abstract god enters concrete existent
must accept faith faith alone clearly cannot like process whereby existent related another involves passage realm another accessible human mind christians lacked faith failed live attacked kierkegaard theological root violent criticism established church denmark

two influential ideas subjectivity[a] notion popularly referred leap faith
however danish equivalent english phrase leap faith does appear original danish nor english phrase found current english translations kierkegaard's works
kierkegaard does mention concepts faith leap together many times works
kierkegaard's manuscript philosophical fragments
leap faith conception how individual believe god how person act love
faith decision based evidence say certain beliefs god true certain person worthy love
no such evidence ever enough completely justify kind total commitment involved true religious faith romantic love
faith involves making commitment anyway
kierkegaard thought faith same time doubt
example truly faith god also doubt one's beliefs god doubt rational part person's thought involved weighing evidence without faith no real substance
someone does realize christian doctrine inherently doubtful there no objective certainty truth does faith merely credulous
example takes no faith believe pencil table exists looking touching
same way believe faith god know no perceptual any other access god yet still faith god
kierkegaard writes doubt conquered faith just faith brought doubt world
kierkegaard also stresses importance self self's relation world being grounded self-reflection introspection
argued concluding unscientific postscript philosophical fragments subjectivity truth truth subjectivity
distinction objectively true individual's subjective relation such indifference commitment truth
people sense believe same things may relate those beliefs quite differently
two individuals may both believe many those around them poor deserve help knowledge may lead them decide actually help poor
how kierkegaard put priceless invention statistics glorious fruit culture characteristic counterpart de te narratur fabula [the tale you] antiquity
schleiermacher enthusiastically declares knowledge does perturb religiousness religious person does sit safeguarded lightning rod scoff god yet help statistical tables laughs life
other words kierkegaard says difficult task teacher lectures earnest things meteor's distance everyday life -- learner should put use? kierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity regard religious matters
already noted argues doubt element faith impossible gain any objective certainty religious doctrines such existence god life christ
most hope conclusion probable christian doctrines true person believe such doctrines degree seemed likely true she genuinely religious
faith consists subjective relation absolute commitment these doctrines
philosophical criticism kierkegaard's famous philosophical 20 th century critics include theodor adorno emmanuel levinas
non-religious philosophers such jean-paul sartre martin heidegger supported many aspects kierkegaard's philosophical views rejected religious views
critic adorno's book kierkegaard construction aesthetic most irresponsible book ever written kierkegaard because adorno takes kierkegaard's pseudonyms literally constructs philosophy makes seem incoherent unintelligible
another reviewer says adorno [far away] credible translations interpretations collected works kierkegaard today
levinas' main attack kierkegaard focused ethical religious stages especially fear trembling
levinas criticises leap faith saying suspension ethical leap religious type violence leap faith course presented pseudonym thus representing kierkegaard's own view intending prompt exact kind discussion engaged critics
states kierkegaardian violence begins existence forced abandon ethical stage order embark religious stage domain belief
belief no longer sought external justification
even internally combined communication isolation hence violence passion
origin relegation ethical phenomena secondary status contempt ethical foundation being led through nietzsche amoralism recent philosophies
levinas pointed judeo-christian belief god first commanded abraham sacrifice isaac angel commanded abraham stop
abraham truly religious realm listened angel's command should continued kill isaac
levinas transcending ethics seems like loophole excuse would-be murderers their crime thus unacceptable
interesting consequence levinas' critique seemed reveal levinas viewed god projection inner ethical desire rather absolute moral agent
however kierkegaard's central points fear trembling religious sphere entails ethical sphere abraham faith god way another ethically right even commands someone kill
therefore deep down abraham faith god absolute moral authority never allow end something ethically heinous murdering own child passed test blind obedience versus moral choice
sartre objected existence god existence precedes essence follows meaning term sentient sentient being cannot complete perfect
being nothingness sartre's phrasing god pour-soi being-for-itself consciousness also en-soi being-in-itself thing contradiction terms
critics sartre rebutted objection stating rests false dichotomy misunderstanding traditional christian view god
sartre agreed kierkegaard's analysis abraham undergoing anxiety sartre calls anguish claimed god abraham
lecture existentialism humanism sartre wondered whether abraham ought doubted whether god actually spoke
kierkegaard's view abraham's certainty origin 'inner voice' cannot demonstrated shown another problem comes soon abraham wants understood
kierkegaard every external proof justification merely outside external subject
kierkegaard's proof immortality soul example rooted extent wishes live forever
faith something kierkegaard often wrestled throughout writing career under both real name behind pseudonyms explored many different aspects faith
these various aspects include faith spiritual goal historical orientation faith particularly toward jesus christ faith being gift god faith dependency historical object faith passion faith resolution personal despair
