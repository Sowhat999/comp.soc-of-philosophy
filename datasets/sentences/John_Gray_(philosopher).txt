gray's political thought famous mobility across political spectrum over years
student gray left continued vote labour mid-1970 s 1976 shifted towards right-liberal new right position convinced world changing irrevocably through technological inventions realigned financial markets new economic power blocs left failed comprehend magnitude nature change
1990 s gray became advocate environmentalism new labour
gray considers conventional left-wing/right-wing political spectrum conservatism social democracy no longer viable
recently criticised neoliberalism global free market central currents western thinking such humanism while moving towards aspects green thought drawing gaia theory james lovelock
perhaps critique humanism gray best known
central doctrine humanism gray’s view inherently utopian belief meliorism humans limited their biological natures advances ethics politics cumulative alter improve human condition same way advances science technology altered improved living standards
gray contends opposition view history progressive cyclical
human nature argues inherent obstacle cumulative ethical political progress
seeming improvements there any very easily reversed example cited use torture united states against terrorist suspects
what's interesting gray interview 032 c magazine torture came back embraced liberals defended liberals
now there lot people both liberal conservative say 'well it's very complicated issue
wasn't complicated until recently
didn't say five ten years ago
furthermore argues belief progress commonly imagined secular liberal fact derived erroneous christian notion humans morally autonomous beings categorically different other animals
belief corresponding idea history makes sense progressing towards something gray’s view merely christian prejudice
straw dogs argues idea humans self-determining agents does pass acid test experience
those darwinist thinkers believe humans take charge their own destiny prevent environmental degradation view naturalists apostles humanism
identifies enlightenment point christian doctrine salvation taken over secular idealism became political religion universal emancipation aim
communism fascism global democratic capitalism characterised gray enlightenment 'projects' led needless suffering gray's view result their ideological allegiance religion
agonistic liberalism term agonistic liberalism appears gray's book isaiah berlin 1995
gray uses phrase describe believes berlin's theory politics namely support both value pluralism liberalism
generally agonistic liberalism used describe any kind liberalism claims own value commitments form complete vision politics society instead needs look berlin calls uneasy equilibrium competing values
under gray's understanding many contemporary liberal theorists fall category instance john rawls karl popper
agonistic liberalism alternative berlin's theory value pluralism liberalism
while berlin claimed equal validity conflicting liberal views agonistic liberalism holds over time solutions may found determines values correct
agonistic liberalism theory conflict rather discussion basis social change
