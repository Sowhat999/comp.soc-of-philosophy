other bolsheviks particular bukharin left communists viewed things differently believing peace central powers betrayal international socialism russia should instead wage war revolutionary defense believed provoke uprising german proletariat against their nation's government
lenin proposed three-month armistice decree peace then approved second congress soviets presented german austro-hungarian governments
germans responded positively viewing opportunity focus their attentions western front stave off looming defeat
november armistice talks began brest-litovsk headquarters german high command eastern front russian delegation being led trotsky adolph joffe
meanwhile ceasefire designed last until january agreed
during negotiations germans insisted keeping their wartime conquests included poland lithuania courland whereas russians countered violation these nations' rights self-determination
there hopes among bolsheviks armistice negotiations dragged out indefinitely until such time proletarian revolution break out throughout europe
7 january 1918 trotsky returned brest litovsk st
petersburg informing government central powers presented them ultimatum either accept germany's territorial demands war resume
signing treaty january again february lenin urged bolsheviks accept germany's proposals
argued territorial losses acceptable ensured survival bolshevik-led government however majority bolsheviks rejected position hoping prolong armistice call germany's bluff
18 february german army relaunched offensive advancing further russian-controlled territory within day conquering dvinsk
point lenin finally convinced small majority bolshevik central committee accept central powers' demands
23 february central powers issued new ultimatum russian government recognise german control poland baltic states also ukraine else face full-scale invasion russia itself
3 march treaty brest litovsk signed
treaty resulted massive territorial losses russia 26% former empire's population 37% agricultural harvest area 28% industry 26% railway tracks two-thirds coal iron reserves being transferred german control
accordingly treaty deeply unpopular across russia's political spectrum several bolsheviks left socialist revolutionaries resigned sovnarkom protest
after treaty signed sovnarkom focused attentions attempting foment proletarian revolution germany issuing array anti-war anti-government publications country german government retaliated expelling russia's diplomats
however month wilhelm ii german emperor resigned country's new administration signed armistice november 1918
result sovnarkom proclaimed treaty brest-litovsk devoid meaning
anti-kulak campaigns cheka red terror see also decossackization red terror [the bourgeoisie] practised terror against workers soldiers peasants interests small group landowners bankers whereas soviet regime applies decisive measures against landowners plunderers their accomplices interests workers soldiers peasants
lenin red terror
many cities western russia facing famine result chronic food shortages
lenin claimed blame problem lay kulaks wealthier peasants allegedly hoarding their produce
may 1918 issued requisitioning order established armed detachments confiscate grain kulaks distribution cities june called upon formation committees poor peasants aid requisitioning effort
policy resulted vast social disorder violence armed detachments often clashing peasant groups providing much fuel developing civil war
prominent example lenin's views matter provided august 1918 telegram sent bolsheviks penza called upon them suppress peasant insurrection publicly hanging least 100 known kulaks rich men [and] bloodsuckers
requisitioning efforts disincentived peasants producing grain personally consume thus production slumped
booming black market supplemented official state-sanctioned economy lenin calling speculators black marketeers looters shot
both socialist revolutionaries left socialist-revolutionaries condemned these armed appropriations grain fifth all-russian congress soviets july 1918 coming realize committees poor peasants also persecuting peasants kulaks accordingly contributing anti-government feeling among peasantry december 1918 lenin abolished them
lenin repeatedly emphasised need terror violence used order old order overthrown revolution succeed
speaking all-russian central executive committee soviets november 1917 declared state institution built up sake exercising violence
previously violence exercised handful moneybags over entire people now want
organise violence interests people
suggestions made government should abolish capital punishment strongly opposed idea declaring never! how you safeguard revolution without executions? fearing anti-bolshevik forces overthrow administration december 1917 lenin ordered establishment emergency commission combating counter-revolution sabotage cheka political police force under leadership felix dzerzhinsky
corpses those killed red terror outside headquarters kharkov cheka september 1918 sovnarkom passed decree red terror
red terror seen having designed eliminate bourgeoisie class although lenin want exterminate bourgeoisie merely those sought reinstate their rule
majority victims well-to-do citizens former members tsarist administration
however also used exterminate many non-bourgeois anti-bolsheviks perceived social undesirables such prostitutes
cheka claimed right both sentence execute anyone whom deemed enemy government without recourse revolutionary tribunals
accordingly throughout soviet russia cheka carried out killings often large numbers petrograd cheka instance executing 512 people over course few days
there no surviving records provide accurate figure how many perished due red terror although later estimates historians ranged 10000 15000 hand 50000 140000 other
lenin never witnessed violence participated first hand publicly distanced himself
although regularly doing coded telegrams confidential notes published articles speeches typically call executions
many bolsheviks expressed disapproval cheka's mass executions feared organisation's apparent unaccountability actions
party brought attempts restrain activities early 1919 stripping powers tribunal execution however applied those few areas under official martial law cheka therefore continued their activities before large swathes country
1920 cheka become most powerful institution soviet russia exerting influence over other state apparatus
establishment concentration camps entrusted cheka dzerzhinsky orchestrating their construction spring 1919 onward although subsequently administered new government agency gulag
end 1920 84 camps established across soviet russia holding circa 50000 prisoners october 1923 grown 315 camps approximately 70000 inmates
those interned camps used slave labor
july 1922 intellectuals deemed opposition bolshevik government exiled inhospitable regions deported russia altogether lenin personally scrutinized lists those dealt manner
may 1922 lenin issued decree calling execution anti-bolshevik priests resulting 14000 20000 deaths
although russian orthodox church worst affected government's anti-religious policies also impacted roman catholic protestant churches jewish synagogues islamic mosques
civil war polish-soviet war lenin trotsky klim voroshilov red army soldiers petrograd 1921 although lenin expected russia's aristocracy bourgeoisie oppose government believed sheer numerical superiority lower classes coupled bolsheviks' ability effectively organise them guaranteed swift victory any conflict
failed anticipate intensity violent opposition bolshevik rule russia
ensuing russian civil war pitted pro-bolshevik reds against anti-bolshevik whites also encompassed ethnic conflicts russia's borderlands conflict both red white armies local peasant groups green armies throughout former empire
accordingly various historians seen civil war representing two distinct conflicts revolutionaries counter-revolutionaries other different revolutionary factions
white armies established former officers tsarist military included anton denikin's volunteer army south russia alexander kolchak's forces siberia nikolai yudenich troops newly independent baltic states
whites bolstered 35000 members czech legion prisoners war conflict central powers turned against sovnarkom allied themselves committee members constituent assembly komuch anti-bolshevik government established samara
however white cause hindered fact fragmented geographically scattered well fact ethnic russian supremacism expressed whites alienated region's national minorities
responding anti-bolshevik threats lenin tasked trotsky establishing workers' peasants' red army
lenin's support september 1918 trotsky organised revolutionary military council remaining chairman until 1925
recognising often valuable military experience lenin agreed officers previously loyal tsar serve red army although trotsky established military councils monitor activities such individuals
during conflict bolsheviks primarily held area great russia while white opposition situated largely peripheries former empire
significantly bolsheviks held control russia's two largest cities moscow petrograd
1919 white armies retreat
white russian anti-bolshevik propaganda poster anti-bolshevik armies carried out white terror campaign violence against perceived bolshevik supporters although typically spontaneous state-sanctioned red terror
both white red armies responsible attacks against jewish communities prompting lenin issue condemnation anti-semitism blamed such hatred jews capitalist propaganda
western governments backed white forces perceiving treaty best litovsk betrayal allied war effort fearing bolsheviks' calls world revolution
western support soon took active role conflict july 1918 4000 troops provided united kingdom france united states canada italy serbia landed murmansk taking control kandalaksha august their troop numbers grown 10000
november 1918 british us japanese forces landed vladivostok latter soon having 70000 troops based siberia
japan saw opportunity territorial expansion desiring bring russia's far eastern maritime province under own imperial control
while japanese troops remained play part civil war western troops soon ordered home although western governments continued provide white armies officers technicians armaments
bolsheviks killed czechoslovak legionaries th regiment nikolsk ussuriysky 1918 july 1918 sverdlov informed sovnarkom ural regional soviet overseen execution former tsar immediate family yekaterinburg order prevent them being rescued advancing white troops
although lacking proof biographers historians like richard pipes dmitri volkogonov expressed view killing probably sanctioned lenin although historian james ryan cautioned there no reason believe
lenin however killing axiomatic highlighted precedent set execution louis xvi french revolution
after brest litovsk treaty left socialist revolutionaries increasingly come view bolsheviks traitors revolutionary cause
july 1918 left socialist revolutionary yakov grigorevich blumkin assassinated german ambassador russia wilhelm von mirbach unsuccessfully hoping ensuing diplomatic incident lead relaunched revolutionary war against germany
left socialist revolutionaries then launched coup moscow shelling kremlin seizing city's central post office however their uprising soon put down trotsky's forces
party's leaders many their members arrested imprisoned although bolsheviks showed greater leniency toward them done many other opponents
1920 polish-soviet war broke out after poland attempted annex parts belarus western ukraine may 1920 conquered kiev
after forcing polish army back lenin urged red army push poland itself believing polish proletariat rise up support russian troops thus spark european revolution
although trotsky other bolsheviks sceptical eventually agreed invasion however polish proletariat uprising failed materialise red army defeated battle warsaw
polish armies began push red army back russia forcing sovnarkom sue peace war culminated peace riga treaty russia ceded territory poland paid them reparations
comintern world revolution international world revolution near although revolutions never made order
imperialism cannot delay world revolution
imperialists will set fire entire world will start conflagration themselves will perish dare quell revolution
