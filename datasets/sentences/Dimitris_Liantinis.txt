establish position further devotes part work effort define exactly real value ancient greece well true world-view proposed
argues against notion ancient greece although ahead time most antiquity perhaps middle ages eventually superseded advancements renaissance europe
contrast believed greeks possessed complete culture kind super-set western cultures past present

topic often touched upon highly controversial issue alleged superiority greek jewish culture former being expressed through ancient philosophers folk mythology latter through great judaic religions judaism islam most importantly christianity
death also central work claimed ancient greeks
denied notion greece culture playful joyfulness argued greeks instead presented us world infinite melancholy idea consistent nietzsche's whom greatly admired
their philosophy study death their conclusions absolute hard accept since saw death final end no afterlife moral rewards life lived earth
liadinis adhered notion once again contrasted less heroic view held judaic religions
shed new light alleged suicide potentially infusing great moral courage ponders distance separates man honours natural knowledge once dead will vanish [
taught believe once dead will migrate heavenly america [τα ελληνικά 1992 p
classicism romanticism liantinis believed romanticism classicism valid world-views constitute both artistic style way life
believed these two antithetical nature former expression pure emotions while latter logic

goethe tried marry two failed experiment recorded second part faust appropriately called quest helen
there faust representing romantic hero lies bed helen troy produce still-born child
although story symbolises impossibility task deemed important many others like greece's national poet dionysios solomos took upon themselves complete
views education education central saw long struggle humanity rise above animal level something elaborate turn explain universe created view consistent anthropic principle made reference
education carrier monumental effort contains living memories people forms language poetry
these views expressed mainly homo educandus τα ελληνικά roughly translated 'the greek language' blamed part moral decline contemporaries shallowness rigidity modern day teachers transmit knowledge focusing form rather content
instead argued qualitative understanding literature poetry example need distinguish different value levels various greek intellectuals rather presenting them single entity great men greek letters
also spoke great difficulty understanding teaching poetry within rigid framework formal explanations valued over deep understanding meaning
advocated total separation church state especially matters education since considers christianity antithetical greek thought must choose other
following stance warned against increasing influence then archbishop christodoulos athens involvement greek politics
greek vs jewish culture vast highly controversial issue
liantinis thought christianity main vessel jewish culture west understand position better might want look medieval greek history byzantine empire church aligned emperors destroyed remained ancient greek alongside other pagan religions often through brutal means
liantinis' argument however historical
claims greeks morally superior courage create morality reflected finite nature existence rather imposing divine law imaginary god guarantees eternal life heavens
sorrowful longing death greeks gave birth art

harshly realistic view proved hard maintain gemma writes jews cultivated land faith
greeks cultivated land knowledge [
jews executioners greeks judges
why jews won
alleged defeat greek culture featured frequently work illustrated thought experiment found same book contemporary europeans asked empedocles anaximander leucippus other somewhat lesser known yet important philosophers
presumes few any will answer conviction yet same sample immediately recognise biblical figures moses abraham noah
extends these thoughts seminal thinkers like sigmund freud albert einstein karl marx giant jews science called them [gemma 1997] while contemporary greeks totally unable offer anyone equivalent importance
views death according liadinis notion death occupied ancients such degree see their whole culture arising radical views held subject
saw death unchanging cosmic law much like today's notion entropy associate whatever afterlife conceived moral system reward punishment like ones found great judaic religions
although individual myths like sisyphus condemned eternal punishment realms hades exist largely exceptions rule never developed proper system beliefs life after death
lectures liantinis says homer describes scene hero before engaging battle says opponent race men related leaves οἵη περ φύλλων γενεὴ τοίη δὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν momentarily stand fresh tree branch then quickly surrender wind rain
lyric poet pindar also questions works [men] dreams shadows
σκιᾶς ὄναρ ἄνθρωπος
even shadows proper liantinis points out
form immortality liantinis greeks according believed called intra-world immortality ενδοκοσμική αθανασία comes memories man leaves behind through deeds life example
indeed accordance immense value ancient greeks placed posthumous reputation υστεροφημία
same subject also emphasised greek hero's individualism opposite eastern dissolution self inside great universe even point choosing own death
