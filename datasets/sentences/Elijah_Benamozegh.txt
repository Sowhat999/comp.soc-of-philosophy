benamozegh even considered gospels highly valuable jewish midrash comparable talmudic aggadah
respected jesus wise righteous jew criticized religious innovations paul
theological works benamozegh suggested explain christian dogmas trinity incarnation oversimplified corrupt version kabbalistic panentheistic doctrine divine emanations
while disagreed trinitarian christian theology considered unlike most other orthodox rabbis erroneous misunderstanding subtle kabbalistic doctrines major deviation monotheism
moreover claimed christianity too monotheistic comparison kabbalah views pagan deities their essence partial manifestations faces absolute
similarly benamozegh criticized christian view jesus incarnated god monistic panentheistic grounds
according benamozegh's kabbalistic view entire world incarnation shechina feminine aspect divinity
believed hinduism closer respect mystical judaism christianity
benamozegh offered novel mystical interpretation ludwig feuerbach's atheistic philosophy
feuerbach god merely product human mind
benamozegh explained feuerbach essentially right however people call god limited human perception apophatic infinite absolute
indeed dualistic panentheistic highly complex views godhead common kabbalistic literature
number known rabbis criticized kabbalah gnostic-like dualistic views god
benamozegh's universalist views recently promoted adin steinsaltz made somewhat similar attempt unify major world religions philosophies
cosmopolitanism patriotism benamozegh considered himself simultaneously italian patriot cosmopolitan
believed authentic mystical core jewish tradition called hebraism opposed isolationist exoteric judaism profoundly universal capable uniting world religions nations brotherly cosmopolitan network
while benamozegh believed unique spiritual mission jews idea jewish chosenness far narrow particularism
according worldview jews chosen serve humanity priestly people proving common mystical ground transcends boundaries nations religious traditions
also emphasized impact other cultures judaism starting ancient egyptian paganism well great role proselytes jewish history
unlike exclusivist kabbalists benamozegh believed kabbalah universal theology unites human beings views them equals
same time benamozegh staunch italian patriot
even daring formulation based jewish declaration faith o israelites you will love italy you will love her your heart your soul your mind
