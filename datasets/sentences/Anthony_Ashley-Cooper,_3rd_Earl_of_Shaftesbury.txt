assessment shaftesbury's amiability character seems principal characteristics
like locke peculiar pleasure bringing forward young men
among these may especially mentioned michael ainsworth native wimborne st giles young man recipient letters addressed student university maintained shaftesbury university college oxford
interest shaftesbury took studies desire should specially fitted profession selected clergyman church england marked features letters
other protegés crell young pole two young furlys harry wilkinson boy sent furly's office rotterdam whom several letters still extant record office addressed
popular mind shaftesbury generally regarded writer hostile religion
however short orthodoxy might fall tried standards any particular church temperament pre-eminently religious
fact shown letters
belief god all-wise all-just all-merciful governing world providentially best pervades works correspondence life
nor any wish undermine established beliefs except conceived conflicted truer religion purer morality
public ordinances church scrupulously conformed
unfortunately there many things both teaching practice ecclesiastics day calculated repel men sober judgment high principle
these evil tendencies popular presentation christianity undoubtedly begot shaftesbury's mind certain amount repugnance contempt doctrines christianity itself cultivating almost set purpose sense ridiculous too apt assume towards such doctrines their teachers tone raillery
whatever might shaftesbury's speculative opinions mode expressing them witnesses bear testimony elevation purity life aims
earnest student ardent lover liberty enthusiast cause virtue man unblemished life untiring beneficence shaftesbury probably no superior generation
character pursuits remarkable considering rank life born circumstances under brought up
many respects reminds us stoic philosopher roman emperor marcus aurelius whose works studied avidity whose influence stamped upon own productions

shaftesbury papers record office
writing style shaftesbury took great pains elaboration style succeeded far make meaning transparent
thought clear
other hand equally succeed attaining elegance object seems equally aimed
there curious affectation style—a falsetto note—which notwithstanding efforts please often irritating reader
main characteristic perhaps best hit off charles lamb calls genteel
poses too much fine gentleman anxious taken pedant vulgar scholastic kind falls hardly attractive pedantry aesthete virtuoso
easily read understood
fowler writing early 20 th century th edition encyclopædia britannica states probably wide popularity works enjoyed 18 th century hence agreeable feeling notwithstanding their false taste their tiresome digressions impress modern reader
philosophy engraving anthony ashley cooper first volume characteristicks 1732 shaftesbury's philosophical importance due mainly ethical speculations motive primarily refutation hobbes' egoistic doctrine
method empirical psychology examined man first unit himself secondly wider relations larger units society universe mankind
great principle harmony balance based general ground good taste feeling opposed method reason first place man individual complex appetites passions affections less perfectly controlled central reason
moral man these factors duly balanced
whoever says least versed moral kind architecture will find inward fabric adjusted
barely extending single passion too far continuance
too long able bring irrecoverable ruin misery
social being man part greater harmony order may contribute happiness whole must order extra-regarding activities shall clash environs
regulated internal social relations ideal regarded rule moral
egoist altruist both imperfect
ripe perfection humanity two impulses will perfectly adjusted
thus criterion harmony shaftesbury refutes hobbes deduces virtue benevolence indispensable morality
also drawn close parallel moral aesthetic criteria
just there faculty apprehends beauty sphere art there sphere ethics faculty determines value actions
faculty described first time english thought moral sense see hutcheson conscience cf
essence primarily emotional non-reflective process development becomes rationalized education use
emotional rational elements moral sense shaftesbury fully analyse see home
principle follows distinction right wrong part constitution human nature morality stands apart theology moral qualities actions determined apart arbitrary will god ultimate test action tendency promote general harmony welfare appetite reason concur determination action moralist concerned solve problems free will determinism
these results see shaftesbury opposed hobbes locke close agreement hutcheson ultimately deeply religious thinker inasmuch discards moral sanction public opinion terrors future punishment authority civil authority main incentives goodness substitutes voice conscience love god
these two alone move men aim perfect harmony own sake man universe
shaftesbury's philosophical activity confined ethics religion aesthetics earliest writers bring prominence concept sublime aesthetic quality
metaphysics properly called even psychology except far afforded basis ethics evidently no taste
logic probably despised merely instrument pedantic judgment day especially universities there too much ground
main object moralists propound system natural theology vindicate far natural religion concerned ways god man
articles shaftesbury's religious creed few simple these entertained conviction amounting enthusiasm
may briefly summed up belief god whose most characteristic attribute universal benevolence moral government universe future state man making up imperfections repairing inequalities present life
shaftesbury emphatically optimist there passage moralists pt
4 lead us suppose regarded matter indifferent principle coexistent coeternal god limiting operations cause evil imperfection notwithstanding benevolence creator still found work
view optimism correct shaftesbury mill says leibniz must regarded maintaining best imaginable possible worlds
brief notice shaftesbury's scheme natural religion conspicuously imperfect unless added popularized pope's essay man several lines especially first epistle simply statements moralists done verse
whether however these taken immediately pope shaftesbury whether came through papers bolingbroke prepared use no means determining
other hand pope certainly read shaftesbury's work mentions character theocles latter's moralists dunciad iv
487–490 bright image our fancy draw/which theocles raptur'd vision saw/while thro' poetic scenes genius roves/or wanders wild academic groves
notes these lines pope directs reader various passages shaftesbury's work
reception influence shaftesbury's writings considerable both home abroad
ethical system reproduced though precise philosophical form hutcheson descended certain variations hume adam smith
nor without effect even speculations butler
so-called deists shaftesbury probably most important certainly most plausible most respectable
no sooner characteristics appeared welcomed terms warm commendation le clerc leibniz
1745 denis diderot adapted reproduced inquiry concerning virtue afterwards known essai sur le mérite et vertu
1769 french translation whole shaftesbury's works including letters published geneva
translations separate treatises german began made 1738 1776–1779 there appeared complete german translation characteristics
hermann hettner says leibniz voltaire diderot lessing mendelssohn wieland herder drew most stimulating nutriment shaftesbury
charms adds ever fresh
new-born hellenism divine coitus beauty presented itself before inspired soul
herder especially eulogistic
adrastea pronounces moralists composition form well-nigh worthy grecian antiquity contents almost superior
interest felt german literary men shaftesbury revived publication two excellent monographs dealing mainly theological side gideon spicker freiburg baden 1872 other dealing mainly philosophical side georg von gizycki leipzig 1876
