huxley little formal schooling virtually self-taught
became perhaps finest comparative anatomist latter 19 th century
worked invertebrates clarifying relationships groups previously little understood
later worked vertebrates especially relationship apes humans

like other british scientists nineteenth century such alfred russel wallace huxley brought up literate middle-class family fallen hard times
father mathematics teacher ealing school until closed putting family financial difficulties
result thomas left school age 10 after two years formal schooling
despite unenviable start huxley determined educate himself
became great autodidacts nineteenth century
first read thomas carlyle james hutton's geology hamilton's logic
teens taught himself german eventually becoming fluent used charles darwin translator scientific material german
learned latin enough greek read aristotle original
huxley aged 21 later young adult made himself expert first invertebrates later vertebrates self-taught
skilled drawing many illustrations publications marine invertebrates
later debates writing science religion grasp theology better most clerical opponents
huxley boy left school ten became most knowledgeable men britain
apprenticed short periods several medical practitioners 13 brother-in-law john cooke coventry passed thomas chandler notable experiments using mesmerism medical purposes
chandler's practice london's rotherhithe amidst squalor endured dickensian poor
here thomas seen poverty crime rampant disease worst
next another brother-in-law took john salt eldest sister's husband
now 16 huxley entered sydenham college behind university college hospital cut-price anatomy school whose founder marshall hall discovered reflex arc
time huxley continued programme reading made up lack formal schooling
year later buoyed excellent results silver medal prize apothecaries' yearly competition huxley admitted study charing cross hospital obtained small scholarship
charing cross taught thomas wharton jones professor ophthalmic medicine surgery university college london
jones robert knox's assistant knox bought cadavers burke hare
young wharton jones acted go-between exonerated crime thought best leave scotland
fine teacher up-to-date physiology also ophthalmic surgeon
1845 under wharton jones' guidance huxley published first scientific paper demonstrating existence hitherto unrecognised layer inner sheath hairs layer known since huxley's layer
no doubt remembering course knowing merit later life huxley organised pension old tutor

vertebrate palaeontology first half huxley's career palaeontologist marked rather strange predilection 'persistent types' seemed argue evolutionary advancement sense major new groups animals plants rare absent phanerozoic
same vein tended push origin major groups such birds mammals back palaeozoic era claim no order plants ever gone extinct
much paper consumed historians science ruminating strange somewhat unclear idea
huxley wrong pitch loss orders phanerozoic low 7% estimate number new orders evolved
persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next darwin's fluid ideas despite intelligence took huxley surprisingly long time appreciate implications evolution
however gradually huxley moved away conservative style thinking understanding palaeontology discipline itself developed

huxley also rejected lamarck's theory transmutation basis there insufficient evidence support
scepticism brought together lecture royal institution made darwin anxious enough set effort change young huxley's mind
kind thing darwin closest scientific friends must particular intuition huxley accounts most impressive person even young man
huxley therefore small group knew darwin's ideas before published group included joseph dalton hooker charles lyell
first publication darwin ideas came wallace sent darwin famous paper natural selection presented lyell hooker linnean society 1858 alongside excerpts darwin's notebook darwin letter asa gray
huxley's famous response idea natural selection how extremely stupid thought that! however correctness natural selection main mechanism evolution lie permanently huxley's mental pending tray
never conclusively made up mind though admit hypothesis good working basis
logically speaking prior question whether evolution taken place
question much charles darwin's origin species devoted
publication 1859 completely convinced huxley evolution no doubt admiration darwin's way amassing using evidence formed basis support darwin debates followed book's publication
huxley's support started anonymous favourable review origin times december 1859 continued articles several periodicals lecture royal institution february 1860
same time richard owen whilst writing extremely hostile anonymous review origin edinburgh review also primed samuel wilberforce quarterly review running 17000 words

day wilberforce repeated arguments quarterly review article written yet published then ventured onto slippery ground
famous jibe huxley whether huxley descended ape mother's side father's side probably unplanned certainly unwise
huxley's reply effect rather descended ape man misused great talents suppress debate—the exact wording certain—was widely recounted pamphlets spoof play
letters alfred newton include brother giving eye-witness account debate written less month afterwards
other eyewitnesses two exceptions hooker especially thought made best points give similar accounts varying dates after event
general view still huxley got much better exchange though wilberforce himself thought done quite well
absence verbatim report differing perceptions difficult judge fairly huxley detailed account darwin letter does survive however letter friend frederick daniel dyster does survive account just three months after event
effect debate increase hugely huxley's visibility amongst educated people through accounts newspapers periodicals
another consequence alert importance public debate lesson never forgot
third effect serve notice darwinian ideas easily dismissed contrary vigorously defended against orthodox authority
fourth effect promote professionalism science implied need scientific education
fifth consequence indirect wilberforce feared defence evolution undermine literal belief old testament especially book genesis

huxley's reservations natural selection type until selection breeding seen give rise varieties infertile each other natural selection cannot proved
huxley's position selection agnostic yet gave no credence any other theory

huxley chose teaching extent research take straightforward course concentrating personal strengths
schools bible huxley also major influence direction taken british schools november 1870 voted onto london school board
primary schooling advocated wide range disciplines similar taught today reading writing arithmetic art science music etc
secondary education recommended two years basic liberal studies followed two years upper-division work focusing specific area study
practical example latter famous 1868 lecture piece chalk first published essay macmillan's magazine london later year
piece reconstructs geological history britain simple piece chalk demonstrates science organized common sense
huxley supported reading bible schools
may seem out step agnostic convictions believed bible's significant moral teachings superb use language relevant english life
advocate burning your ship get rid cockroaches
however huxley proposed create edited version bible shorn shortcomings errors
statements men science absolutely entirely demur
these tender children [should] taught you yourselves believe
board voted against idea also voted against idea public money should used support students attending church schools
vigorous debate took place such points debates minuted detail
huxley will never party enabling state sweep children country denominational schools
act parliament founded board schools permitted reading bible permit any denominational doctrine taught
may right see huxley's life work contributing secularisation british society gradually occurred over following century
ernst mayr hardly doubted [biology] helped undermine traditional beliefs value systems — huxley anyone else responsible trend britain
modern christian apologists consider huxley father antitheism though himself maintained agnostic atheist
however lifelong determined opponent almost organised religion throughout life especially roman church

adult education huxley's interest education went still further school university classrooms made great effort reach interested adults kinds after himself largely self-educated
there lecture courses working men many published afterwards there use made journalism partly earn money mostly reach out literate public
