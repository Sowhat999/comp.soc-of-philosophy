effect much deeper however causing vibration soul inner resonance—a spiritual effect colour touches soul itself
inner necessity kandinsky principle art foundation forms harmony colours
defines principle efficient contact form human soul
every form delimitation surface another possesses inner content effect produces looks attentively
inner necessity right artist unlimited freedom freedom becomes licence founded such necessity
art born inner necessity artist enigmatic mystical way through acquires autonomous life becomes independent subject animated spiritual breath
obvious properties see look isolated colour let act alone side warmth coldness colour tone other side clarity obscurity tone
warmth tendency towards yellow coldness tendency towards blue yellow blue form first great dynamic contrast
yellow eccentric movement blue concentric movement yellow surface seems move closer us while blue surface seems move away
yellow typically terrestrial colour whose violence painful aggressive
blue celestial colour evoking deep calm
combination blue yellow yields total immobility calm green
clarity tendency towards white obscurity tendency towards black
white black form second great contrast static
white deep absolute silence full possibility
black nothingness without possibility eternal silence without hope corresponds death
any other colour resonates strongly neighbors
mixing white black leads gray possesses no active force whose tonality near green
gray corresponds immobility without hope tends despair becomes dark regaining little hope lightens
red warm colour lively agitated forceful movement itself
mixed black becomes brown hard colour
mixed yellow gains warmth becomes orange imparts irradiating movement surroundings
red mixed blue moves away man become purple cool red
