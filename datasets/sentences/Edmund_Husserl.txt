6 april husserl suspended university freiburg badische ministry culture following week disallowed any university activities
yet colleague heidegger elected rector university 21–22 april joined nazi party
contrast july husserl resigned deutsche academie
despite retirement husserl gave several notable lectures
first paris 1929 led méditations cartésiennes paris 1931
husserl here reviews epoché transcendental reduction presented earlier pivotal ideen 1913 terms further reduction experience calls 'sphere ownness
within sphere husserl enacts order show impossibility solipsism transcendental ego finds itself already paired lived body another ego another monad
'a priori' interconnection bodies given perception founds interconnection consciousnesses known transcendental intersubjectivity husserl go describe length volumes unpublished writings
there debate over whether husserl's description ownness movement intersubjectivity sufficient reject charge solipsism descartes example subject
argument against husserl's description works way instead infinity deity being ego's gateway other descartes husserl's ego cartesian meditations itself becomes transcendent
remains however alone unconnected
ego's grasp analogy other e
conjectural reciprocity allows possibility 'objective' intersubjectivity hence community
later husserl lectured prague 1935 vienna 1936 resulted very differently styled work while innovative no less problematic die krisis belgrade 1936
husserl describes here cultural crisis gripping europe then approaches philosophy history discussing galileo descartes several british philosophers kant
apolitical husserl before specifically avoided such historical discussions pointedly preferring go directly investigation consciousness
merleau-ponty others question whether husserl here does undercut own position husserl attacked principle historicism while specifically designing phenomenology rigorous enough transcend limits history
contrary husserl may indicating here historical traditions merely features given pure ego's intuition like any other
longer section follows life world [lebenswelt] observed objective logic science world seen our subjective experience
yet problem arises similar dealing 'history' above chicken-and-egg problem
does life world contextualize thus compromise gaze pure ego does phenomenological method nonetheless raise ego up transcendent? these last writings presented fruits professional life
since university retirement husserl worked tremendous pace producing several major works
after suffering fall autumn 1937 philosopher became ill pleurisy
edmund husserl died freiburg 27 april 1938 having just turned 79
wife malvine survived
eugen fink research assistant delivered eulogy
gerhard ritter freiburg faculty member attend funeral anti-nazi protest
heidegger nazi era husserl incorrectly rumoured denied use library freiburg result anti-jewish legislation april 1933
however among other disabilities husserl unable publish works nazi germany cf
above footnote die krisis 1936
also rumoured former pupil nazi party member martin heidegger informed husserl discharged actually former rector
apparently husserl heidegger moved apart during 1920 s became clearer after 1928 husserl retired heidegger succeeded university chair
summer 1929 husserl studied carefully selected writings heidegger coming conclusion several their key positions differed e
heidegger substituted dasein [being-there] pure ego thus transforming phenomenology anthropology type psychologism strongly disfavored husserl
such observations heidegger along critique max scheler put lecture husserl gave various kant societies frankfurt berlin halle during 1931 entitled phänomenologie und anthropologie
war-time 1941 edition heidegger's primary work being time first published 1927 original dedication husserl removed
due negation relationship two philosophers however rather result suggested censorship heidegger's publisher feared book might otherwise banned nazi regime
dedication still found footnote page 38 thanking husserl guidance generosity
husserl course died several years earlier
post-war editions sein und zeit dedication husserl restored
complex troubled sundered philosophical relationship husserl heidegger widely discussed
4 may 1933 professor edmund husserl addressed recent regime change germany consequences future alone will judge true germany 1933 true germans—those subscribe less materialistic-mythical racial prejudices day those germans pure heart mind heirs great germans past whose tradition revere perpetuate
after death husserl's manuscripts amounting approximately 40000 pages gabelsberger stenography complete research library 1939 smuggled belgium franciscan priest herman van breda
there deposited leuven form husserl-archives higher institute philosophy
much material research manuscripts since published husserliana critical edition series
development thought several early themes first works husserl tries combine mathematics psychology philosophy main goal provide sound foundation mathematics
analyzes psychological process needed obtain concept number then tries build up systematical theory analysis
achieve uses several methods concepts taken teachers
weierstrass derives idea generate concept number counting certain collection objects
brentano stumpf takes over distinction proper improper presenting
example husserl explains following way you standing front house you proper direct presentation house you looking ask directions then these directions e
house corner street indirect improper presentation
other words you proper presentation object actually present improper symbolic also calls you indicate object through signs symbols etc
husserl's logical investigations 1900–1901 considered starting point formal theory wholes their parts known mereology
another important element husserl took over brentano intentionality notion main characteristic consciousness intentional
while often simplistically summarised aboutness relationship mental acts external world brentano defined main characteristic mental phenomena distinguished physical phenomena
every mental phenomenon every psychological act content directed object intentional object
every belief desire etc
object believed wanted
brentano used expression intentional inexistence indicate status objects thought mind
property being intentional having intentional object key feature distinguish mental phenomena physical phenomena because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether
[citation needed] elaboration phenomenology years after 1900–1901 publication main work logische untersuchungen logical investigations husserl made key conceptual elaborations led assert order study structure consciousness distinguish act consciousness phenomena directed objects intended
knowledge essences possible bracketing assumptions existence external world
procedure called epoché
these new concepts prompted publication ideen ideas 1913 first incorporated plan second edition logische untersuchungen
ideen onward husserl concentrated ideal essential structures consciousness
metaphysical problem establishing reality perceive distinct perceiving subject little interest husserl spite being transcendental idealist
husserl proposed world objects ways direct ourselves toward perceive those objects normally conceived called natural standpoint characterized belief objects exist distinct perceiving subject exhibit properties see emanating them
husserl proposed radical new phenomenological way looking objects examining how our many ways being intentionally directed toward them actually constitute them distinguished materially creating objects objects merely being figments imagination phenomenological standpoint object ceases something simply external ceases seen providing indicators becomes grouping perceptual functional aspects imply another under idea particular object type
notion objects real expelled phenomenology bracketed way regard objects—instead feature inheres object's essence founded relation object perceiver
order better understand world appearances objects phenomenology attempts identify invariant features how objects perceived pushes attributions reality their role attribution things perceive assumption underlying how perceive objects
major dividing line husserl's thought turn transcendental idealism
later period husserl began wrestle complicated issues intersubjectivity specifically how communication object assumed refer same ideal entity cartesian meditations meditation v
husserl tries new methods bringing readers understand importance phenomenology scientific inquiry specifically psychology means bracket natural attitude
crisis european sciences husserl's unfinished work deals most directly these issues
husserl first time attempts historical overview development western philosophy science emphasizing challenges presented their increasingly one-sidedly empirical naturalistic orientation
husserl declares mental spiritual reality possess their own reality independent any physical basis science mind 'geisteswissenschaft' must established scientific foundation natural sciences managed my conviction intentional phenomenology first time made spirit spirit field systematic scientific experience thus effecting total transformation task knowledge
thought further information phenomenology philosophy husserl's thought revolutionary several ways most notably distinction 'natural' 'phenomenological' modes understanding
former sense-perception correspondence material realm constitutes known reality understanding premised accuracy perception objective knowability called 'real world'
phenomenological understanding strives rigorously 'presuppositionless' means husserl calls 'phenomenological reduction'
reduction conditioned rather transcendental husserl's terms pure consciousness absolute being
husserl's work consciousness any given thing calls discerning meaning 'intentional object'
such object does simply strike senses interpreted misinterpreted mental reason already selected grasped grasping being etymological connotation percipere root 'perceive
meaning object logical investigations 1900/1901 experience judgment published 1939 husserl expressed clearly difference meaning object
identified several different kinds names
example there names role properties uniquely identify object
each these names expresses meaning designates same object
examples victor jena loser waterloo equilateral triangle equiangular triangle both cases both names express different meanings designate same object
there names no meaning role designating object aristotle socrates
finally there names designate variety objects
these called universal names their meaning concept refers series objects extension concept
way know sensible objects called sensible intuition
husserl also identifies series formal words necessary form sentences no sensible correlates
examples formal words over under two group
every sentence must contain formal words designate husserl calls formal categories
there two kinds categories meaning categories formal-ontological categories
meaning categories relate judgments include forms conjunction disjunction forms plural among others
formal-ontological categories relate objects include notions such set cardinal number ordinal number part whole relation
way know these categories through faculty understanding called categorial intuition
through sensible intuition our consciousness constitutes husserl calls situation affairs sachlage
passive constitution objects themselves presented us
situation affairs through categorial intuition able constitute state affairs sachverhalt
situation affairs through objective acts consciousness acts constituting categorially serve basis constituting multiple states affairs
example suppose two sensible objects certain situation affairs
use basis say a<b b>a two judgments designate same state affairs
husserl sentence proposition judgment meaning refers state affairs situation affairs reference base
philosophy logic mathematics husserl believed truth-in-itself ontological correlate being-in-itself just meaning categories formal-ontological categories correlates
logic formal theory judgment studies formal priori relations among judgments using meaning categories
mathematics other hand formal ontology studies possible forms being objects
hence both logic mathematics different formal categories objects study sensible objects themselves
problem psychological approach mathematics logic fails account fact approach formal categories simply abstractions sensibility alone
reason why deal sensible objects mathematics because another faculty understanding called categorial abstraction
through faculty able get rid sensible components judgments just focus formal categories themselves
thanks eidetic intuition essential intuition able grasp possibility impossibility necessity contingency among concepts among formal categories
categorial intuition along categorial abstraction eidetic intuition basis logical mathematical knowledge
husserl criticized logicians day focusing relation subjective processes give us objective knowledge pure logic
subjective activities consciousness need ideal correlate objective logic constituted noematically constituted consciousness needs noetic correlate subjective activities consciousness
husserl stated logic three strata each further away consciousness psychology those precede
first stratum husserl called morphology meanings concerning priori ways relate judgments make them meaningful
stratum elaborate pure grammar logical syntax call rules laws prevent non-sense similar logic calls today formation rules
mathematics logic's ontological correlate also similar stratum morphology formal-ontological categories
second stratum called husserl logic consequence logic non-contradiction explores possible forms true judgments
includes here syllogistic classic logic propositional logic predicates
semantic stratum rules stratum laws avoid counter-sense laws prevent contradiction
very similar today's logic transformation rules
mathematics also similar stratum based among others pure theory pluralities pure theory numbers
provide science conditions possibility any theory whatsoever
husserl also talked called logic truth consists formal laws possible truth modalities precedes third logical third stratum
third stratum metalogical called theory possible forms theories
explores possible theories priori fashion rather possibility theory general
establish theories possible relations pure forms theories investigate these logical relations deductions such general connection
logician free see extension deductive theoretical sphere pure logic
ontological correlate third stratum theory manifolds
formal ontology free investigation mathematician assign several meanings several symbols their possible valid deductions general indeterminate manner
properly speaking most universal mathematics
through posit certain indeterminate objects formal-ontological categories well any combination mathematical axioms mathematicians explore apodeictic connections them long consistency preserved
according husserl view logic mathematics accounted objectivity series mathematical developments time such n-dimensional manifolds both euclidean non-euclidean hermann grassmann's theory extensions william rowan hamilton's hamiltonians sophus lie's theory transformation groups cantor's set theory
jacob klein student husserl pursued line inquiry seeking desedimentize mathematics mathematical sciences
husserl psychologism philosophy arithmetic frege after obtaining ph mathematics husserl began analyzing foundations mathematics psychological point view
habilitation thesis concept number 1886 philosophy arithmetic 1891 husserl sought employing brentano's descriptive psychology define natural numbers way advanced methods techniques karl weierstrass richard dedekind georg cantor gottlob frege other contemporary mathematicians
later first volume logical investigations prolegomena pure logic husserl while attacking psychologistic point view logic mathematics also appears reject much early work although forms psychologism analysed refuted prolegomena apply directly philosophy arithmetic
scholars question whether frege's negative review philosophy arithmetic helped turn husserl towards platonism already discovered work bernhard bolzano independently around 1890/91 explicitly mentioned bernard bolzano gottfried leibniz hermann lotze inspirations newer position
husserl's review ernst schröder published before frege's landmark 1892 article clearly distinguishes sense reference thus husserl's notions noema object also arose independently
likewise criticism frege philosophy arithmetic husserl remarks distinction content extension concept
moreover distinction subjective mental act namely content concept external object developed independently brentano school may surfaced early brentano's 1870 s lectures logic
scholars such j
mohanty claire ortiz hill guillermo e
rosado haddock among others argued husserl's so-called change psychologism platonism came independently frege's review
example review falsely accuses husserl subjectivizing everything no objectivity possible falsely attributes notion abstraction whereby objects disappear until left numbers mere ghosts
contrary frege states husserl's philosophy arithmetic already find two different kinds representations subjective objective
moreover objectivity clearly defined work
frege's attack seems directed certain foundational doctrines then current weierstrass's berlin school husserl cantor cannot orthodox representatives
furthermore various sources indicate husserl changed mind psychologism early 1890 year before published philosophy arithmetic
husserl stated time published book already changed mind—that doubts psychologism very outset
attributed change mind reading leibniz bolzano lotze david hume
husserl makes no mention frege decisive factor change
logical investigations husserl mentions frege twice once footnote point out retracted three pages criticism frege's foundations arithmetic again question frege's use word bedeutung designate reference rather meaning sense
letter dated 24 may 1891 frege thanked husserl sending copy philosophy arithmetic husserl's review ernst schröder's vorlesungen über die algebra logik
same letter frege used review schröder's book analyze husserl's notion sense reference concept words
hence frege recognized early 1891 husserl distinguished sense reference
consequently frege husserl independently elaborated theory sense reference before 1891
commentators argue husserl's notion noema nothing frege's notion sense because noemata necessarily fused noeses conscious activities consciousness
noemata three different levels substratum never presented consciousness support properties object noematic senses different ways objects presented us modalities being possible doubtful existent non-existent absurd
consequently intentional activities even non-existent objects constituted form part whole noema
frege however conceive objects forming parts senses proper name denotes non-existent object does reference hence concepts no objects no truth value arguments
moreover husserl maintain predicates sentences designate concepts
according frege reference sentence truth value husserl state affairs
frege's notion sense unrelated husserl's noema while latter's notions meaning object differ those frege
detail husserl's conception logic mathematics differs frege held arithmetic derived logic
husserl case mathematics exception geometry ontological correlate logic while both fields related neither strictly reducible other
husserl's criticism psychologism reacting against authors such j
mill christoph von sigwart own former teacher brentano husserl criticised their psychologism mathematics logic
their conception these abstract priori sciences having essentially empirical foundation prescriptive descriptive nature
according psychologism logic autonomous discipline branch psychology either proposing prescriptive practical art correct judgement brentano orthodox students description factual processes human thought
husserl pointed out failure anti-psychologists defeat psychologism result being unable distinguish foundational theoretical side logic applied practical side
pure logic does deal thoughts judgings mental episodes priori laws conditions any theory any judgments whatsoever conceived propositions themselves
here ‘judgement’ same meaning ‘proposition’ understood grammatical ideal unity meaning
case distinctions acts forms judgement provide foundations laws pure logic
categorial hypothetical disjunctive existential judgements however else may call them pure logic names classes judgements ideal forms propositions
since truth-in-itself being-in-itself ontological correlate since psychologists reduce truth hence logic empirical psychology inevitable consequence scepticism
psychologists also successful showing how induction psychological processes justify absolute certainty logical principles such principles identity non-contradiction
therefore futile base certain logical laws principles uncertain processes mind
confusion made psychologism related disciplines such biologism anthropologism due three specific prejudices
first prejudice supposition logic somehow normative nature
husserl argues logic theoretical
logic itself proposes priori laws themselves basis normative side logic
since mathematics related logic cites example mathematics formula like + ba = a² b² does tell us how think mathematically
just expresses truth
proposition says product sum difference should give us difference squares does express normative proposition normative statement based theoretical statement + ba = a² b²
psychologists acts judging reasoning deriving psychological processes
therefore role psychology provide foundation these processes
husserl states effort made psychologists metábasis eis állo génos gr
μετάβασις εἰς ἄλλο γένος transgression another field
[citation needed] metábasis because psychology cannot possibly provide any foundations priori laws themselves basis ways should think correctly
psychologists problem confusing intentional activities object these activities
important distinguish act judging judgment itself act counting number itself
counting five objects undeniably psychological process number 5
judgments true true
psychologists argue judgments true because become evidently true us
evidence psychological process guarantees truth indeed psychological process
husserl responds saying truth itself well logical laws remain valid regardless psychological evidence true
no psychological process explain priori objectivity these logical truths
criticism psychologism distinction psychological acts their intentional objects difference normative side logic theoretical side derives platonist conception logic
means should regard logical mathematical laws being independent human mind also autonomy meanings
essentially difference real everything subject time ideal irreal everything atemporal such logical truths mathematical entities mathematical truths meanings general

martin heidegger best known husserl's students whom husserl chose successor freiburg
heidegger's magnum opus being time dedicated husserl
shared their thoughts worked alongside each other over decade university freiburg heidegger being husserl's assistant during 1920–1923
heidegger's early work followed teacher time began develop new insights distinctively variant
husserl became increasingly critical heidegger's work especially 1929 included pointed criticism heidegger lectures gave during 1931
heidegger while acknowledging debt husserl followed political position offensive harmful husserl after nazis came power 1933 husserl being jewish origin heidegger infamously being then nazi proponent
academic discussion husserl heidegger extensive
göttingen 1913 adolf reinach 1884–1917 now husserl's right hand

scheler's work formalism ethics nonformal ethics value appeared new journal 1913 1916 drew acclaim
personal relationship two men however became strained due scheler's legal troubles scheler returned munich
although scheler later criticised husserl's idealistic logical approach proposed instead phenomenology love states remained deeply indebted husserl throughout work
nicolai hartmann once thought center phenomenology perhaps no longer
1921 prestige hartmann neo-kantian professor philosophy marburg added movement publicly declared solidarity actual work die phänomenologie

jean-paul sartre also largely influenced husserl although later came disagree key points analyses
sartre rejected husserl's transcendental interpretations begun ideen 1913 instead followed heidegger's ontology

merleau-ponty's description 'motor intentionality' sexuality example retain important structure noetic/noematic correlation ideas yet furher concretize means husserl consciousness particularizes itself modes intuition
merleau-ponty's most clearly husserlian work perhaps philosopher shadow
depending interpretation husserl's accounts eidetic intuition given husserl's phenomenological psychology experience judgment may merleau-ponty accept eidetic reduction nor pure essence result
