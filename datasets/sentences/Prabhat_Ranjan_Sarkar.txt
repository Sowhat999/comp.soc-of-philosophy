—thomas lombardo sarkar's philosophy

considered himself incorrigible optimist thinking
cosmology sarkar describes universe result macropsychic conation entire universe exists within cosmic mind itself first expression consciousness coming under bondage own nature
evolution unit beings individual life extroversial projection cosmic mind starts return journey unique colourful fashion
no two entities universe same yet same goal merge once their source infinite cosmic consciousness
such cosmological flow limitless consciousness limited consciousness back limitless consciousness attained meditation
realms mind according sarkar's philosophy individual mind composed five layers called kosas kamamaya kosa layer desire crude mind layer controls body
operates instinct passion
layer sometimes conscious sometimes subconscious
manomaya kosa layer thinking subtle mind layer thought memory
kosa gives experience pleasure pain developed naturally through physical clash ananda marga sadhana pranayama cosmic ideation
atimanasa kosa supramental mind intuitive layer
kosa gives capacity intuitive dreams clairvoyance telepathy creative insight
developed naturally through psychic clash ananda marga sadhana methods pratyahara withdrawal such shuddhis guru puja
vijinanamaya kosa layer special knowledge subliminal mind layer conscience discrimination viveka vaeragya non-attachment
kosa developed naturally through psychic clash development accelerated process dharana
hiranyamaya kosa golden level subtle causal mind subtlest layer
here awareness mind very close direct experience supreme consciousness
here there separation thin veil ignorance
kosa developed naturally through attraction great dhyana accelerates process sadhakas spirituals aspirants
biopsychology sarkar's biopsycology explains how traditional tantric science chakras wheels their subtle energies related body through nerve plexi physiologic counterparts influencing associated endocrine glands neuroendocrine system psychic part body
philosophy ananda marga consider human body composed same five fundamental factors rest universe explained p
sarkar's theory brahmachakra
every factor distributed throughout body controlled controlling nucleus chakra substations mind each controlling their own assigned area
just mind functions directly through brain chakras function through their own physical counterparts endocrine glands
biopsychology ananda marga expands further explanations concept seven basic chakras general mainly considers muladhara chakra tip spine controls solid factor
svadhisthana chakra level genitals controls liquid factor associated reproductive glands
manipura chakra level navel controls luminous factor associated pancreas
anahata chakra center chest controls aerial factor associated thymus
vishuddha chakra throat controls ethereal factor associated thyroid gland
ajina chakra eyebrows associated pituitary gland
sahasrara chakra crown head associated pineal gland
mind's propensities vrttis associated each chakra affect glands hormones secreted those glands hence emotions physical behaviour functioning various body systems
glands hormones secrete may also affect mind chain feedbacks

sarkar's microvita theory microvita seems first expressions life
however concept still infancy conceives various types microvita both positive negative varying degrees evolutionary existence
sadhana central point sarkar's philosophy concept sadhana
describes sadhana practice transformation fearful love fearless love
sadhana concretised particular practice meditation complete merger unification
sarkar recommends disciples daily practice individual meditation weekly practice collective meditation

social political philosophy law social cycle main article law social cycle concept varna describes four main socio-psychological types whereby human psychological physical endowment social motivations expressed vipra intellectual kshatriya warrior vaishya acquisitor shudra labourer
varna sarkar's perspective however just psychological trait rather archetype approximately michel foucault's notion epistemes broader frameworks knowledge defining true real
sarkar's law social cycle applies these traits theory historical evolution ages rise fall terms ruling elites representing above-mentioned traits
law possibly connects earlier cyclical historical ideas sri aurobindo focus psychology human development well ibn khaldun among other macrohistorians ideas cycles
however along cyclical dimension — rise fall ages — sarkar's theory exhibits correspondent linear dimension economic technological progress considered critical terms meeting changing material conditions life

sarkar considered necessary social arrangements support inner development human beings rejected both capitalism communism appropriate social structures humanity move forward golden age balanced way life sustaining all-round progress
serious problem capitalism according sarkar concentration wealth few hands stoppages rolling money considered root causes recessions even depressions
spiritual way life however no way divorced creating structures help meet basic though ever changing needs — food housing clothing health education
sarkar claims developed both ánanda márga progressive utilization theory practical means encourage harmony co-operation help society escape proposed cycle
sarkar argues once social cycle understood sadvipras evolved then periods exploitation largely reduced eliminated
leadership representative aspects varnas — leader engaged service courageous uses intellect benefits others innovative/entrepreneurial skills — cycle become upward spiral

sarkar underlying spirit humanism extended everything animate inanimate universe designated neohumanism
neohumanism will elevate humanism universalism cult love created beings universe
neohumanism prefer existential value over utility value living beings
sarkar's neohumanism places great emphasis rationality encourages calls protospiritual mentality process continually recognising each object come contact externally internally manifestation supreme consciousness brahma
