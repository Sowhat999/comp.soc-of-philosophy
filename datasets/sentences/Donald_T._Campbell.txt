blind variation selective retention blind variation selective retention bvsr phrase introduced donald t
campbell describe most fundamental principle underlying cultural evolution
cybernetics seen principle describing change evolutionary systems general just biological organisms
example also applied scientific discovery memetic evolution genetic programming
such forms foundation later called universal darwinism
evolutionary epistemology applying bvsr principle evolution knowledge campbell founded domain evolutionary epistemology
seen generalization karl popper's philosophy science conceives development new theories process proposing conjectures blind variation followed refutation selective elimination those conjectures empirically falsified
campbell added same logic blind variation selective elimination/retention underlies knowledge processes scientific ones
thus bvsr mechanism explains creativity also evolution instinctive knowledge our cognitive abilities general

ethnocentrism disciplines fish-scale model omniscience campbell wide wide collaborator distrustful academic knowledge any field whose knowledge resided small clusters separated other fields
parody situation article fish-scale model omniscience called scholars stray their immediate discipline work create bridges fish scales! their disclipine neighboring ones
rather praying “may competent well-read x-ologist may keep up literature my field” scholar will pray “make me novel fish-scale
let my pattern inevitably incomplete competence cover areas neglected others
each scholar then try pattern journal subscriptions unique her department university profession
noting scholar colleague reading same set journals scholar feel guilty vow drop these favor other
recognizing interdisciplinary links collaborative web knowledge weakest scholar give up ingroup journal favor outgroup
scholar feel guilty she cut attendance ingroup conventions attend relevant outgroup ones forth
