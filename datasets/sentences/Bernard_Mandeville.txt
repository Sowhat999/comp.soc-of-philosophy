fable bees details topic see fable bees
fable bees 1924 1705 published poem under title grumbling hive knaves turn'd honest two hundred doggerel couplets
1714 republished integral part fable bees private vices public benefits consisting prose commentary called remarks essay enquiry origin moral virtue
1723 later edition appeared including essay charity charity schools search nature society
vigorously combatted among others bishop berkeley william law author serious call 1729 made subject prosecution immoral tendency
essay criticised charity schools designed educate poor doing instil virtue them
mandeville disagreed idea education adds virtue because believe evil desires existed poor rather saw educated wealthy much crafty
mandeville also believed educating poor increased their desires material things defeating purpose school making difficult provide them
book primarily written political satire state england 1705 tories accusing john churchill st duke marlborough ministry advocating war spanish succession personal reasons
grumbling hive mandeville describes bee community thriving until bees suddenly made honest virtuous
without their desire personal gain their economy collapses remaining bees go live simple lives hollow tree thus implying without private vices there exists no public benefit
edition 1723 presented nuisance grand jury middlesex denounced london journal theophilus philo-britannus attacked many writers notably archibald campbell 1691–1756 st andrews aretelogia published own alexander innes 1728 afterwards campbell under own name 1733 enquiry original moral virtue
fable reprinted 1729 ninth edition appeared 1755 often reprinted recent times
berkeley attacked second dialogue alciphron 1732 john brown criticised essay upon shaftesbury's characteristics 1751
ideas mandeville's philosophy gave great offence time stigmatised false cynical degrading
main thesis actions men cannot divided lower higher
higher life man mere fiction introduced philosophers rulers simplify government relations society
fact virtue defined every performance man contrary impulse nature should endeavour benefit others conquest own passions out rational ambition being good actually detrimental state commercial intellectual progress
because vices
self-regarding actions men alone means inventions circulation capital economics connection luxurious living stimulate society action progress
private vice public benefit mandeville concluded vice variance christian virtues time necessary condition economic prosperity
viewpoint severe juxtaposed adam smith's
both smith mandeville believed individuals' collective actions bring public benefit
however sets philosophy apart smith's catalyst public benefit
smith believed virtuous self-interest results invisible co-operation
most part smith saw no need guide garner public benefit
other hand mandeville believed vicious greed led invisible co-operation properly channelled
mandeville's qualification proper channelling further parts philosophy smith's laissez-faire attitude
essentially mandeville called politicians ensure passions man result public benefit
stated belief fable bees private vices dextrous management skilful politician may turned publick benefits
fable shows society possessed virtues blest content honesty falling apathy utterly paralysed
absence self-love cf
hobbes death progress
so-called higher virtues mere hypocrisy arise selfish desire superior brutes
moral virtues political offspring flattery begot upon pride
similarly arrives great paradox private vices public benefits
among other things mandeville argues basest vilest behaviours produce positive economic effects
libertine example vicious character yet spending will employ tailors servants perfumers cooks prostitutes
these persons turn will employ bakers carpenters like
therefore rapaciousness violence base passions libertine benefit society general
[citation needed] similar satirical arguments made restoration augustan satirists
[citation needed] division labour mandeville early describer division labour adam smith makes use examples
mandeville says will wholly apply himself making bows arrows whilst another provides food third builds huts fourth makes garments fifth utensils become useful another callings employments themselves will same number years receive much greater improvements promiscuously follow’d every five
watch-making come higher degree perfection arrived yet whole remain’d employment person am persuaded even plenty clocks watches well exactness beauty may made chiefly owing division made art many branches

endeavours show social laws crystallised results selfish aggrandizement protective alliances among weak
denying any form moral sense conscience regards social virtues evolved instinct self-preservation give-and-take arrangements partners defensive offensive alliance feelings pride vanity artificially fed politicians antidote dissension chaos
mandeville's ironic paradoxes interesting mainly criticism amiable idealism shaftesbury comparison serious egoistic systems hobbes helvétius
