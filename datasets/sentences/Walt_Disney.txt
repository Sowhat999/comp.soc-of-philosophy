disney biographer neal gabler first writer gain unrestricted access disney archives concluded 2006 available evidence support accusations antisemitism
cbs interview gabler summarized findings that's questions everybody asks me
my answer conventional sense think someone being antisemite
got reputation because 1940 s got himself allied group called motion picture alliance preservation american ideals anti-communist antisemitic organization
though walt himself my estimation antisemitic nevertheless willingly allied himself people antisemitic reputation stuck
never really able expunge throughout life
disney eventually distanced himself motion picture alliance 1950 s
gabler three months after riefenstahl's visit disney disavowed claiming know she issued invitation
gabler also questioned babbitt's story grounds disney no time political meetings something political naïf during 1930 s
walt disney family museum acknowledges disney difficult relationships jewish individuals including babbitt david hilberman ethnic stereotypes common films 1930 s included early cartoons such three little pigs big bad wolf comes door dressed jewish peddler opry house mickey mouse dressed dances hasidic jew both gabler museum point out donated regularly jewish charities hebrew orphan asylum yeshiva college jewish home aged american league free palestine named 1955 man year b'nai b'rith chapter beverly hills
artist story man joe grant noted most influential people studio jewish—including himself production manager harry tytle herman kay kamen head marketing once joked disney's new york office jews book leviticus
songwriter robert
sherman asserted autobiography saw no evidence antisemitism during seven years close work disney according gabler none disney's employees—including babbitt disliked disney intensely—ever accused making antisemitic slurs taunts
disney also accused racism largely because number productions released during 1930 s '40 s '50 s containing racially insensitive material
examples include mickey's mellerdrammer mickey mouse dresses blackface black bird short killed cock robin sunflower half donkey/half black centaurette watermelon fantasia feature film song south american indians peter pan crows dumbo although case made crows sympathetic dumbo because knew like ostracized
spite walt disney no racist gabler
never either publicly privately made disparaging remarks blacks asserted white superiority
like most white americans generation however racially insensitive
example during story meeting snow white seven dwarfs referred dwarfs piling top each other nigger pile while casting song south used term pickaninny
song south roundly criticized film critics naacp others perpetuation black stereotypes disney later campaigned successfully honorary academy award star james baskett first african american honored
baskett died shortly afterward widow disney heartfelt letter gratitude support
black animator floyd norman worked disney during 1950 s '60 s once observe hint racist behavior walt disney often accused after death
treatment people—and mean people—can called exemplary
