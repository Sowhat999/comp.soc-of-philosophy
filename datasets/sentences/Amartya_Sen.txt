economics first class minor mathematics graduating student university calcutta
1953 moved trinity college cambridge earned second
economics 1955 first class topping list well

while sen officially ph
student cambridge though finished research 1955-6 offered position professor head economics department newly created jadavpur university calcutta became youngest chairman head department economics
served position starting new economics department during 1956 1958
meanwhile sen elected prize fellowship trinity college gave four years freedom anything liked made radical decision study philosophy
sen explained broadening my studies philosophy important me just because my main areas interest economics relate quite closely philosophical disciplines example social choice theory makes intense use mathematical logic also draws moral philosophy does study inequality deprivation also because found philosophical studies very rewarding their own
interest philosophy however dates back college days presidency read books philosophy debated philosophical themes
cambridge there major debates supporters keynesian economics hand neo-classical economists skeptical keynes other
however because lack enthusiasm social choice theory both trinity cambridge sen choose different subject ph
thesis choice techniques 1959 though work completed much earlier except valuable advice adjunct supervisor india professor
dasgupta given sen while teaching revising work jadavpur under supervision brilliant vigorously intolerant post-keynesian joan robinson
quentin skinner notes sen member secret society cambridge apostles during time cambridge
research sen's work 'choice technique' complemented maurice dobb
developing country dobb-sen strategy relied maximising investible surpluses maintaining constant real wages using entire increase labour productivity due technological change raise rate accumulation
other words workers expected demand no improvement their standard living despite having become productive
sen's papers late 1960 s early 1970 s helped develop theory social choice first came prominence work american economist kenneth arrow while working rand corporation most famously shown voting rules majority rule two thirds-majority status quo must inevitably conflict might arguably appear basic democratic norm
sen's contribution literature show under conditions arrow's impossibility theorem indeed come pass well extend enrich theory social choice informed interests history economic thought philosophy
official portrait nobel prize 1981 sen published poverty famines essay entitlement deprivation 1981 book argued famine occurs lack food inequalities built mechanisms distributing food
sen also argued bengal famine caused urban economic boom raised food prices thereby causing millions rural workers starve death their wages keep up
sen's interest famine stemmed personal experience
nine-year-old boy witnessed bengal famine 1943 three million people perished
staggering loss life unnecessary sen later concluded
presents data there adequate food supply bengal time particular groups people including rural landless labourers urban service providers like haircutters means buy food price rose rapidly due factors include british military acquisition panic buying hoarding price gouging connected war region
poverty famines sen revealed many cases famine food supplies significantly reduced
bengal example food production while down previous year higher previous non-famine years
thus sen points number social economic factors such declining wages unemployment rising food prices poor food-distribution led starvation
capabilities approach focuses positive freedom person's actual ability something rather negative freedom approaches common economics simply focuses non-interference
bengal famine rural laborers' negative freedom buy food affected
however still starved because positively free anything functioning nourishment nor capability escape morbidity
addition important work causes famines sen's work field development economics considerable influence formulation human development report published united nations development programme
annual publication ranks countries variety economic social indicators owes much contributions sen among other social choice theorists area economic measurement poverty inequality
sen's revolutionary contribution development economics social indicators concept capability developed article equality
argues governments should measured against concrete capabilities their citizens
because top-down development will trump human rights long definition terms remains doubt right something must provided something simply cannot taken away?
instance united states citizens hypothetical right vote
sen concept fairly empty
order citizens capacity vote first must functionings
these functionings range very broad such availability education very specific such transportation polls
such barriers removed citizen truly act out personal choice
up individual society make list minimum capabilities guaranteed society
example capabilities approach practice see martha nussbaum's women human development
controversial article new york review books entitled 100 million women missing see missing women asia analyzing mortality impact unequal rights genders developing world particularly asia
other studies including emily oster argued overestimation though oster since then recanted her conclusions
welfare economics seeks evaluate economic policies terms their effects well-being community
sen devoted career such issues called conscience profession
influential monograph collective choice social welfare 1970 addressed problems related individual rights including formulation liberal paradox justice equity majority rule availability information individual conditions inspired researchers turn their attention issues basic welfare
sen devised methods measuring poverty yielded useful information improving economic conditions poor
instance theoretical work inequality provided explanation why there fewer women men india china despite fact west poor medically unbiased countries women lower mortality rates ages live longer make slight majority population
sen claimed skewed ratio results better health treatment childhood opportunities afforded boys those countries well sex-selective abortions
governments international organizations handling food crises influenced sen's work
views encouraged policy makers pay attention alleviating immediate suffering also finding ways replace lost income poor—for example through public works—and maintain stable prices food
vigorous defender political freedom sen believed famines occur functioning democracies because their leaders must responsive demands citizens
order economic growth achieved argued social reforms—such improvements education public health—must precede economic reform
2009 sen published book called idea justice
based previous work welfare economics social choice theory also philosophical thoughts presented own theory justice meant alternative influential modern theories justice john rawls john harsanyi
opposition rawls also earlier justice theoreticians immanuel kant jean-jacques rousseau david hume inspired philosophical works adam smith mary wollstonecraft sen developed theory both comparative realizations-oriented instead being transcendental institutional
however still regards institutions processes being important
alternative rawls's veil ignorance sen chose thought experiment impartial spectator basis theory justice
also stressed importance public discussion understanding democracy sense john stuart mill focus people's capabilities approach co-developed including notion universal human rights evaluating various states regard justice
