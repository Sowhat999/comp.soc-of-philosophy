she schooled classics well read western spirituality well informed addition theology philosophy psychology physics her day acquired prestigious post editor spectator
early work blue plaque 50 campden hill square london before undertaking many her better known expository works mysticism she first published small book satirical poems legal dilemmas bar-lamb's ballad book received favorable welcome
underhill then three highly unconventional though profoundly spiritual novels
like charles williams later susan howatch underhill uses her narratives explore sacramental intersection physical spiritual
she then uses sacramental framework very effectively illustrate unfolding human drama
her novels entitled grey world 1904 lost word 1907 column dust 1909
her first novel grey world described reviewer extremely interesting psychological study hero's mystical journey begins death then moves through reincarnation beyond grey world choice simple life devoted beauty reflecting underhill's own serious perspective young woman
seems much easier these days live morally live beautifully
lots us manage exist years without ever sinning against society sin against loveliness every hour day
lost word column dust also concerned problem living two worlds reflect writer's own spiritual challenges
1909 novel her heroine encounters rift solid stuff her universe she seen abruptly insecurity those defences protect our illusions ward off horrors truth
she found little hole wall appearances peeping through caught glimpse seething pot spiritual forces whence now then bubble rises surface things
underhill's novels suggest perhaps mystic two worlds may better
her mystical experience seems inseparable kind enhancement consciousness expansion perceptual aesthetic horizons—to see things their meanness insignificance viewed opposition divine reality their luminosity grandeur seen bathed divine radiance
stage mystic's mind subject fear insecurity powers undeveloped
first novel takes us point
further stages demand suffering because mysticism merely vision cultivating latent potentiality soul cosy isolation
according underhill's view subsequent pain tension final loss private painful ego-centered life sake regaining one's true self little first beatific vision
her two later novels built ideal total self-surrender even apparent sacrifice vision itself necessary fullest possible integration human life
her equivalent working out within metaphorical intent life story jesus

column dust heroine's physical death reinforces dramatically mystical death she already surrendered
two lives better condition process painful re-integration intervenes re-establish unity self reality
her characters derive their interest theological meaning value represent her ingenious handling much difficult symbolic material makes her work psychologically interesting forerunner such 20 th-century writers susan howatch whose successful novels also embody psychological value religious metaphor traditions christian mysticism
her first novel received critical acclaim her last generally derided
however her novels give remarkable insight may assume her decision avoid st
augustine described temptation fuga solitudinem flight solitude instead acquiescing loving positive acceptance world
looking back time she already working her magnum opus
writings religion mysticism 1911 underhill's greatest book mysticism study nature development man's spiritual consciousness published 1911 distinguished very qualities make ill-suited straightforward textbook
spirit book romantic engaged theoretical rather historical scientific
underhill little use theoretical explanations traditional religious experience formal classifications analysis
she dismisses william james' pioneering study varieties religious experience 1902 four marks mystic state ineffability noetic quality transcience passivity
james admitted own constitution shut off almost entirely enjoyment mystical states thus treatment purely objective
underhill substituted mysticism practical theoretical 2 mysticism entirely spiritual activity 3 business method mysticism love 4 mysticism entails definite psychological experience
her insistence psychological approach glamorous science pre-war period offering potential key secrets human advances intelligence creativity genius already psychological findings being applied theology
william sanday's christologies ancient modern
she divided her subject two parts first introduction second detailed study nature development human consciousness
first section order free subject mysticism confusion misapprehension she approached point view psychologist symbolist theologian
separate mysticism most dubious connection she included chapter mysticism magic
time still today mysticism associated occult magic secret rites fanaticism while she knew mystics throughout history world's spiritual pioneers
she divided her map way five stages first awakening self
she quotes henry suso disciple meister eckhart servitor saw no form neither any manner being yet joy such might known seeing shapes substances joyful things
heart hungry yet satisfied soul full contentment joy prayers hopes fulfilled
cropper p
46 underhill tells how suso's description how abstract truth related each soul's true nature purpose once remembered contains power fulfilment became starting point her own path
second stage she presents psychological purgation self quoting theologia germanica 14 th century anonymous regarding transcendence ego underhill's little self must cast things us strip ourselves them refrain claiming anything our own
third stage she titles illumination quotes william law everything
nature descended out eternal stands
visible outbirth know how separate out grossness death darkness

fourth stage she describes dark night soul her correspondence leads us believe she struggled throughout her life wherein deprived valuable lower self quoting mechthild magdeburg
since thou hast taken me thee yet thy grace leave me gift every dog nature being true thee my distress am deprived consolation
desire fervently thy heavenly kingdom
last she devotes chapter unitive life sum mystic way love carried us above things divine dark there transformed eternal word image father air penetrated sun thus receive peace incomprehensible light enfolding us penetrating us

although seemed nobody those know developing strong spiritual life penetrating intellect fearless heart deep knowledge human nature remarkable powers expression
point strong pamphlets led campaign against heretical group brethren free spirit led bloemardinne practiced self-indulgent mysticality
[18–20] later two now elderly canons moved countryside groenendael green valley
[21–22] pomerius writes retired hide light might tend better
five years later their community became priory under augustinian canons
many works written during period often drawing lessons nature
favorite tree under sit write 'spirit' gave
solemnly affirmed works composed under domination inspiring power writes underhill
pomerius says ruysbroeck enter state contemplation appeared surrounded radiant light
[26–27] alongside spiritual ascent naghel says cultivated friendship those around enriching their lives
[27–28] also worked garden priory sought help out creatures forest
[29–30] moved senses transcendent without frontiers cleavage she writes these being two moods within mind god
counseled many came including gerard groot brothers common life

doctrine god
several types mystics described
first e
teresa deals personal psychological experiences emotional reactions leaving nature god existing theology
[page 52] second e
plotinus passion sprung vision philosopher intellect often active heart yet like poet such mystic strives sketch vision ultimate
greatest mystics e
augustine embrace once infinite intimate god both near far paradox transcendent-immanent reality self-evident inexpressible truth
such mystics give us turns subjective psychological objective metaphysical reading spiritual experience
here ruysbroeck
[53–54] apostolic mystic represents humanity quest discern divine reality being like artist extending our universe pioneer cutting our path hunter winning food our souls
yet although experience personal language often drawn tradition words may enchant rather inform soul ineffable nature god
ruysbroeck goes venturing hover over abyss 'beyond reason' stammering breaking wild poetry desperate attempt seize unseizable truth
[t]he 'neither nor that'
god known man absolute combines resolves contradictory natures time eternity becoming being both transcendent immanent abstract personal work rest unmoved mover movement itself
god above storm yet inspires flux
[59–60] omnipotent ever-active creator perpetually breathing forth energetic life new births being new floods grace
yet soul may pierce beyond fruitful nature simple essence god
there humans find absolute abiding reality seems man eternal rest 'deep quiet godhead' 'abyss' 'dim silence' taste indeed never know
there 'all lovers lose themselves'
trinity according ruysbroeck works living distinctions fruitful nature persons
yet trinity itself unity three persons godhead
[60–61] beyond within trinity godhead then fathomless abyss simple being god eternal rest god created things
father unconditioned origin strength power things
son eternal word wisdom shines forth world conditions
holy spirit love generosity emanating mutual contemplation father son
three persons exist eternal distinction [emphasis added] world conditions wherein human soul immersed
acts three persons created things born incarnation crucifixion human souls adorned love drawn back our source
circling course divine life-process
beyond above eternal distinction lies superessential world transcending conditions inaccessible thought-- 'the measureless solitude godhead god possesses himself joy
ultimate world mystic
[63–64] there she continues quoting ruysbroeck speak no father son holy spirit nor any creature being very substance divine persons
there before our creation our superessence
there godhead simple essence without activity eternal rest unconditioned dark nameless being superessence created things simple infinite bliss god saints
simple light being
embraces unity divine persons well envelopes irradiates ground fruition human souls divine life-process
union god souls love
[64–65] iv
doctrine humankind
ruysbroeck god 'living pattern creation' impressed image each soul every adult spirit character image must brought hiddenness realized
pattern trinitarian there three properties human soul
first resembling father bare still place consciousness retreats introversion
second following son power knowing divine things intuitive comprehension man's fragmentary share character logos wisdom god
[67–68] third property call spark soul
inward natural tendency soul towards source here receive holy spirit charity god
will god work within human being later spiritual development may form god union eventually unity
[70–71] mighty force love 'very self-hood god' mysterious communion
[72 73] lay hold upon divine life devour assimilate very act divine life devours us knits us up mystical body she writes
nature love says ruysbroeck ever give take love loved these two things meet whomsoever loves
thus love christ both avid generous
devours us feed us
absorbs us utterly himself return gives us very self again
[75–76] hungry love generous love stormy love touches human soul divine creative energy once become conscious evokes us answering storm love
whole our human growth within spiritual order conditioned quality response will industry courage [we accept our] part divine give-and-take
ruysbroeck puts measureless love god himself dwells pure deeps our spirit like burning brazier coal
throws forth brilliant fiery sparks stir enkindle heart senses will desire powers soul fire love storm rage measureless fury love
these weapons fight against terrible immense love god consume loving spirits swallow them himself
love arms us own gifts clarifies our reason commands counsels advises us oppose fight against maintain against our right love long may
[74–75] drama giving receiving love constitutes single act god ocean ebbs flows inbreathing outbreathing
[75 76] love unifying power manifested motion itself 'an outgoing attraction drags us out ourselves calls us melted naughted unity'
next spiritual development soul addressed
[76–88] ruysbroeck adumbrates how may progress active life interior life superessential life these correspond three natural orders becoming being god three rôles servant friend hidden child god
[77 85] active life focuses ethics conforming self's daily life will god takes place world senses means
interior life embraces vision spiritual reality self's contacts divine take place without means
superessential life transcends intellectual plane whereby self does merely behold rather fruition godhead life love work rest union bliss
[78 86 87] analogy traditional threefold way purgation illumination union exact
interior life ruysbroeck contains aspects traditional union also while superessential life takes soul heights fruition few amongst even greatest unitive mystics attained described
[78–79] end her chapter iv she discusses certain key-words frequent ruysbroeck's works e
'fruition' 'simple' [89–90] 'bareness' 'nudity' great pair opposites fundamental thought called flemish vernacular wise onwise
[91–93] wise understood normal man [living] within temporal order use ordinary mental furniture
yet regarding onwise escaped alike tyrannies comforts world made ascent nought
she comments direct unmediated world spiritual intuition self touches reality passed through filters sense thought
after short quote jalālu'ddīn she completes her chapter presenting eighteen lines ruysbroeck's twelve bêguines cap

never sink down reason above reason never climb

her last four chapters underhill continues her discussion ruysbroeck describing active life [94–114] interior life illumination destitution [115–135] union contemplation [136-163] superessential life [164–185]
mysticism plotinus 1919 essay originally published quarterly review 1919 later collected essentials mysticism other essays london j
dent 1920 pp
underhill here addresses plotinus 204–270 alexandria later rome
neoplatonist well spiritual guide plotinus writes regarding both formal philosophy hands-on personal inner experience
underhill makes distinction geographer draws maps mind seeker actually travels realms spirit
[page 118] she observes usually mystics follow mere maps metaphysicians
[page 117] enneads plotinus presents divine unequal triune descending order perfection having nothing seeking nothing needing nothing yet overflows creatively source being emitted nous spirit intelligence wisdom poetic intuition father companion soul [121–122] c emitted soul life vital essence world aspires communion spirit above while also directly engaged physical world beneath
people come forth god will find happiness once re-united first nous later
such might merely logical outcome metaphysician yet plotinus seeker also presents return divine series moral purgations shedding irrational delusions leading eventually entry intuitively beautiful
intellectual moral path toward life aesthetic will progressively disclose invisible source nous forms beauty
love prevailing inspiration although impersonal
mystic will pass through stages purification enlightenment resulting shift center our being sense soul soul spirit preparation ultimate transformation consciousness
[125 127] upon our arrival shall know ecstasy no longer sing out tune form divine chorus round
augustine 354–430 criticizes such neoplatonism neglecting needs struggling imperfect human beings
plotinus may act magnet human soul cannot show mercy nor help love redeem individual earth
other western mystics writing neoplatonists mention lack mutual attraction humanity unconscious unknowable
[130–131] regard julian norwich 1342–1416 write our natural will god good-will god us
plotinus leaves problem evil unresolved having no place blissful life here social ethical side religion seems shorted
philosophy does include qualities comparable gospel's divine transfiguration pain through jesus
plotinus self-sufficient sage does teach us charity writes st
nonetheless underhill notes plotinus neoplatonism very influential among mystics christianity islam
augustine church father himself deeply affected plotinus through western church

influences underhill's life greatly affected her husband's resistance her joining catholic church she powerfully drawn
first she believed delay her decision proved lifelong
however writer himself supportive her writing both before after their marriage 1907 though share her spiritual affinities
her fiction written six years 1903–1909 represents her four major interests general period philosophy neoplatonism theism/mysticism roman catholic liturgy human love/compassion
her earlier writings underhill often using terms mysticism mystics later began adopt terms spirituality saints because she felt less threatening
she often criticized believing mystical life should accessible average person
her fiction also influenced literary creed expounded her close friend arthur machen mainly hieroglyphics 1902 summarised biographer there certain truths universe constitution distinct particular things come before our observation cannot grasped human reason expressed precise words apprehended people least semi-mystical experience called ecstasy work art great insofar experience caught expressed
because however truths concerned transcend language attuned description material objects expression through hieroglyphics such hieroglyphics literature consists
underhill's case quest psychological realism subordinate larger metaphysical considerations she shared arthur machen
incorporating holy grail their fiction stimulated perhaps their association arthur waite affiliation hermetic order golden dawn machen holy grail perhaps hieroglyph crystallisation sacred emblem man's transcendental yearning gateway vision lasting appeasement discontents while her center atonement-linked meanings she pointed out margaret robinson letter responding robinson's criticism underhill's last novel don't marvel your own temerity criticising
why should you? course thing wasn't written you never write anyone except letters direction! take leave think doctrine contained you'll assimilate sooner later won't you any harm
it's mine you know
you will find eckhart
know richard st victor fire love burns
fulfilled our destiny sat down safe distance purring like overfed cats 'suffering ancient law love' highest pleasure bargain oddly enough
sponge cake milk religion neither true world nor next
christ being too august word our little hardships think truer august give our little hardships tincture royalty once try them up
don't think pattern 'meek & lowly' likely fail application very humble ordinary things
most us don't get chance humble ordinary came might life abundantly according our measure
there that's all! two contemporary philosophical writers dominated underhill's thinking time she mysticism rudolf eucken henri bergson
while neither displayed interest mysticism both seemed their disciples advance spiritual explanation universe
also she describes fashionable creed time vitalism term adequately sums up prevailing worship life exuberance variety limitless possibility pervaded pre-war culture society
her eucken bergson confirmed deepest intuitions mystics
armstrong evelyn underhill among mystics ruysbroeck her most influential satisfying medieval mystics she found herself very much years working unknown priest brussels she herself also hidden side
