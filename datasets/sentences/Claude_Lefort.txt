merleau-ponty died 1961 lefort took charge edition manuscripts
1970 s developed analysis bureaucratic regimes eastern europe
read gulag archipelago published book aleksandr solzhenitsyn
main ideas stalinist totalitarianism published 1981 collection titled l'invention démocratique
thought conception totalitarianism lefort part political theorists put forward relevance notion totalitarianism relevant stalinism well fascism considered totalitarianism different essence big categories used western world since ancient greece like notions dictatorship tyranny
however contrary authors like hannah arendt limited notion nazi germany soviet union 1936 1953 lefort applied regimes eastern europe second half century era terror central element totalitarianism other authors lost most extreme dimensions
study these regimes reading gulag archipelago 1973 aleksandr solzhenitsyn developed analysis totalitarianism
double fence society lefort characterizes totalitarian system double fence totalitarianism abolishes separation state society political power permeats society preexisting human relations class solidarity professional religious cooperations tend replaced one-dimensional hierarchy those order those obey
made possible especially through association state party hierarchy very close party hierarchy becomes effective power
lefort like other theorists thus identifies destruction public space fusion political power key element totalitarianism
totalitarianism denies lefort calls principle internal divisions society conception society marked affirmation totality
every organization association profession thus subordinated planning state
differences opinion values democracy abolished entire social body directed towards same goal even personal tastes become politicized must standardized
aim totalitarianism create united closed society components individuals defined completely same goals same opinions same practices
stalinism thus knew identification people proletariat proletariat party party management management 'égocrate'
lefort demonstrates central difference totalitarianism dictatorship dicatorship admit competing transcendental principles like religion ideology totalitarian party religion
dictatorship does aim destruction absorption society dictatorial power power state against society presupposes distinction two plan totalitarian party merge state society closed united uniform system subordinated under fulfilment plan socialism case ussr
lefort calls system people-one process identification power society process homogenisation social space process closing up society authority enchain order constitute totalitarian system
organicist vision society totalitarian system unified organized presents itself like body social body dictatorship bureaucracy apparatus need new system bodies
lefort returns theories ernst kantorowicz two bodies king person totalitarian leader besides physical mortal body political body representing one-people
order ensure proper functioning maintain unity totalitarian system requires other evil other representation exterior enemy against party combats representative forces old society kulaks bourgeois [
emissary stranger imperialistic world
division interior exterior one-people other division totalitarianism tolerates since founded upon division
lefort insists fact constitution one-people necessitates incessant production enemies also speaks their invention
example stalin prepared attack jews ussr died
designing new enemy same way mussolini declared bourgeois eliminated italy after world war ii
relation one-people other prophylactic command enemy parasite eliminate waste
exceeds simple rhetorical effect commonly used contemporary political discourse yet underlying way part metaphorical vision totalitarian society body
vision explained how existence both enemies state their presence bosom population seen illness
violence roused against them organicist metaphor fever symptom fight social body against illness sense campaign against enemy feverish fever good it's sign society evil counteract
situation totalitarian leader within system paradoxical uncertain same time part system head commands rest representation system everything
therefore incarnation one-power
power executed parts one-people
fraility system lefort didn't consider totalitarianism situation almost ideal type potentially realized through terror extermination
rather sees set processes endings cannot known thus their success cannot determined
will totalitarian party realize perfect unity social body controls magnitude action also implies goal impossible achieve because development necessarily leads contradictions oppositions
totalitarianism regime prevailing sense being gnawed away absurdity own ambition total control party active passive resistance those subjected
summarised political scientist dominique colas
conception democracy claude lefort formulates conception democracy mirroring conception totalitarism developing same way analyzing regimes eastern europe ussr
lefort democracy system characterized institutionalization conflict within society division social body recognizes even considers legitimate existence divergent interests conflicting opinions visions world opposed even incompatible
lefort's vision makes disappearance leader political body putting death king kantorowicz calls founding moment democracy because makes seat power hitherto occupied eternal substance transcending mere physical existence monarchs empty space groups shared interests opinions succeed each other time will elections
power no longer tied any specific programme goal proposal nothing collection instruments put temporarily disposal those win majority
lefort's invented inventive democracy writes dominique colas power comes people belongs no
democracy thus regime marked vagueness incompleteness against totalitarianism establishes itself
leads lefort regard democratic every form opposition protest against totalitarianism
opposition protest creates way democratic space within totalitarian system
democracy innovation start new movements designation new issues struggle against oppression creative power capable weakening even slaying totalitarian leviathan
leviathan whose paradoxical frailty lefort emphasises
separation civil society state characterizes modern democracy made possible disembodiment society
democratic country also experience inventive character any group citizens legitimate struggle may seek establish new rights defend interests
lefort does reject representative democracy does limit democracy
instance includes social movements sphere legitimate political debate
