gr μεγάλη η αύξηση αλλά συνεχίστηκε όλα τα επόμενα χρόνια και περισσότερο μάλιστα την τριετία 1990–1993 της νδ διότι δεν πρέπει ποτέ να ξεχνάμε ότι το μικρό και νοικοκυρεμένο κράτος των δεκαετιών του '50 και του '60 ήταν ένα κράτος που ήταν μόνο χωροφύλακας χωρίς δαπάνες στην παιδεία στην υγεία και γενικά χωρίς ενδιαφέρον για την κοινωνία

και αυτό φαίνεται από τις επιλογές του να παραμείνει στην ευρωπαϊκή ένωση που τόσο έντονα είχε αμφισβητήσει λίγα χρόνια νωρίτερα και να παραμείνει στο νατο που τόσο απόλυτα είχε καταδικάσει
