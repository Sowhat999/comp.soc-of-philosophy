philosophy introduction set out historied thought constructed world california 1995 margolis holds philosophy concerned principally three things assume nature real world why assume how much might know real world why after having answered those questions best how should live out our lives why
sees history philosophy concerning these three questions reality knowledge ethics gradual movement away idea any these three realms changeless towards increasing acceptance real change infecting three spheres
margolis emphasizes legitimation philosophy's principal task
margolis defends protagorean dictum man measure things arguing changeless first principles must give way consensual though criterial truth claims
since man measure himself creature history no modal claims invariance possibly sustained
margolis further avers there need no fixities either de re de dicto de cogitatione
world flux our thought also flux
margolis sees whole history western philosophy struggle advocates change those either like parmenides deny change intelligible those like heraclitus find logos law allegedly governs whatever changes admitted
argued cognitive privilege changeless lingers even relatively pragmatic philosophy such work w
nonetheless margolis proposes possible modes legitimation even under ubiquity flux
contrary postmodern philosophers like richard rorty jean-françois lyotard argues our lack cognitive privilege means need philosophical justification becomes less pressing
margolis began close so-called analytical school english-speaking philosophy mature work draws freely both analytic continental philosophy
large part disciplinary eclecticism reflects ambition overcome apparent opposition naturalist tradition analytic philosophy humanistic tradition continental philosophy
achieve margolis treats natural ontologically prior cultural while emphasizing know nature via cultural means hence cultural epistemologically prior natural
position developed length selves other texts penn state 2001
philosophical pursuits expressed programmatically critique most mainstream western philosophers classical modern advocacy consistent form relativism defence radical historicism avoids pitfalls past historicisms such those hegel marx michel foucault account how legitimation functions under historicist conditions
themes margolis published thirty books variety topics philosophy
historied thought constructed world california 1995 argues philosophy uncritically adopts platonic-aristotelian view necessarily reality invariantly structured known discernibly known such
beginning counterproposal - 2
any way conceptually necessary reality possess invariant structures invariant nature - margolis gradually traces out alternative view
instance margolis argues aristotle's discussion principle non-contradiction presupposes changelessness individual things rather providing any proof alleged law
margolis's view non-contradiction applies sentential formulas meaningful sentences since discourse use may offset any seeming contradiction via re-interpretation routinely done science instance case wave theory versus corpuscular theory light
other words there no conceptual necessity accept strictly bivalent logic our logics depend deep sense pre-thinkingly take real world like
hence there no reason disallow relativism world may well kind place incongruent judgments - judgments bivalent reading true false now no longer adhering many valued logic consisting two exclusive truth-values - creatures such ourselves may ever hope legitimate
margolis goes examine reference predication our ability probe communicate results our probings
constative discourse making statements fact — instance need rely identification reidentification items prove effective use
therefore historical memory consensus together narratizing ability necessary ensure stability make reference there need nothing essential things themselves our constative discourse able flourish even thrive
margolis inveighs against postmodernists rorty’s stamp claiming risk disabling constative discourse their objectivist fears privilege
there need according margolis no conceptual privilege involved making statements nor justifications proferred statements made
still margolis emphasizes justifications cannot dispensed any statement implies whole set beliefs way world how know
must legitimize our statements best else should never know why should choose over others nor should know how proceed make other statements building upon going beyond our original exemplars
key how fact go found margolis's major postulate historied thought constructed world thinking history
making meaningful reference within constative discourse thoroughly historical skill
predicate - thus referred - likewise historical
margolis argues struggle entrench changelessness either human thought human nature physical nature large part futile struggle against acknowledging lack any fixed-kind nature human being
futile margolis claims no natures histories
nevertheless margolis admits there enough man-made would-be stabilities fixities go round
there habituating weight customary slow change human languages inertia institutions
margolis acknowledges historized nature human—and therefore truth judgment reality rest - own discovery criticizes most previous versions historicism falling victim theological teleological yearning hegel's geist marx's utopianism heidegger's history being
margolis's view truth claims earlier historical epochs given their historical weight our own historical present our own truth claims regarding theirs subject our own bias blindness ours must still legitimated best legitimate them taking account far humanly possible though never overcoming - our limited horizon via self-critique
margolis claims five philosophical themes gathered momentum time kant
reality cognitively intransparent
everything say world must pass through our conceptual schemes limits our language hence there no way knowing whether say corresponds there world like independent our investigating structure reality structure thought symbiotized
there no way knowing how much apparent intelligibility world contribution mind how much world itself contributes seeming intelligibility thinking history
take universal rational logical necessary right behaviour laws nature changing artifacts historical existence different societies societal groups
open change sites hegemonic struggle structure thinking preformed
our thinking formed enculturing process human babies become adults
infant begins holistic space immediately parsed according norms conduct language she brought up
taking part process alter alter ourselves alter conditions next generation human culture including human beings socially constructed socially constituted
no natures referentially predicatively histories narratized careers
embraces five themes separately conjointly defends them concludes our future investigations ourselves our world risk ignoring them our own peril
own investigations ourselves proceeded focus consideration arts expression human being
after work art 1999 selves other texts 2001 elaborated upon earlier work ontological similarity human persons artworks
latter defined physically embodied culturally emergent entities treats examples human utterance
margolis argues cultural world semantically semiotically dense domain filled self-interpreting texts acts artifacts
affinities critique margolis philosophical affinities hegel marx peirce john dewey later wittgenstein michel foucault
hegel marx takes their historicism without their teleologisms theories historical goal
peirce takes idea secondness brute thingness things guides our sense reality
dewey shares conviction philosophy should never exceed natural bounds
wittgenstein holds accepted given say - forms life pi 226
finally margolis sees foucault's historical a-priori fair replacement kant's transcendental a-priori
margolis extensively criticized sees scientism philosophy singling out thinkers such noam chomsky paul churchland jerry fodor daniel dennett modern-day defenders invariance
