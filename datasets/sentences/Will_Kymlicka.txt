kymlicka held professorships variety different universities canada abroad also worked advisor government canada
thought main concerns throughout work providing liberal framework just treatment minority groups divides two basic categories polyethnic immigrant groups national minorities such canadian québécois māori new zealand
lists criteria national minorities minority nations present founding prior history self-government common culture common language governing selves through institutions
these criteria two minority nations canada first nations population québécois
kymlicka argues such minority groups deserve unique rights state nature their unique role history within national population
group rights also recent innovation western democracy american revolution up enfranchisement women emphasized individual rights fundamental avoided assigning rights particular groups geographic religious linguistic ethnic
polyethnic groups less deserving such rights since come state voluntarily thus degree responsibility integrate norms their new nation
does mean entitled any rights kymlicka argues cultural minorities right choose their own lives does mean entitled same level group rights minority nations entitled
kymlicka makes various exceptions such problems faced refugees whether conflict poverty such minority groups such african-americans whose heritage america clearly begin voluntarily argues their needs regards cultural group-specific rights should considered special basis
multicultural citizenship 1995 kymlicka argues group-specific rights consistent liberalism particularly appropriate outright demanded certain situations
defines three such group-specific rights special group representation rights such affirmative action policies politics self-government rights polyethnic rights such policy exempting sikhs having wear motorcycle helmets
distinction kymlicka draws crucial liberal defence group-specific rights minorities external protection internal restrictions
kymlicka argues external protections groups may justified order promote equality must allow oppression exploitation apartheid south africa
internal restrictions however cannot justified liberal perspective insofar restrict person's autonomy though may granted certain cases national minorities
thoughts human rights standard liberal criticism states group rights problematic because often treat individuals mere carriers group identities rather autonomous social agents overstated oversimplified
actual problem minorities how should viewed liberal democracies much complex
there distinction good group rights bad group rights intolerable group rights
bad group rights internal restrictions rules imposed group upon intra-group relations
most often take form group restricting liberty individual members name group solidarity
indigenous groups try protect themselves women's movements basis threaten social traditional role indigenous populations
contends raises danger individual oppression
internal restrictions used uphold violent dominant absolutist systems
legally imposed internal restrictions thus bad almost unjust
mention go against liberal ideals
good group rights external protections involve inter-group relations
indigenous groups need protection terms their nationals identities limiting vulnerability group decisions external groups society
therefore should right their own taxation health care education governance
