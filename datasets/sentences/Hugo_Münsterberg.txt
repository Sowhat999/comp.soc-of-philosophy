1910-11 appointed exchange professor harvard university berlin
during year founded amerika-institut berlin
during whole period stay united states worked improvement relations united states germany writing america better understanding germany germany higher appreciation america
because work applied psychology münsterberg well known public academic world scientific community
outspoken views münsterberg issues upcoming first world war raised storms controversy ideals position
appeared probably most eminent supporter german policies america such utmost bitterly condemned entente allies their friends pro-germans appeared almost idol
while supporting german policies münsterberg denounced many activities teutonic hyphenates united states
fearing patriotic response overt support german empire undermine own covert approach condemned forming alien party within united states crime against spirit true americanism results reach far beyond time war
death general attitude toward münsterberg changed death went relatively unnoticed
because pro-german attitudes support german policies
try talk inaccurate stereotypes held both germans americans
many books articles attempting correct them including americans 1904
american problems 1910 however highly critical americans saying general inability concentrate their attention any thing very long
world war approached münsterberg's support supposed efficiency modernity german autocracy caused suspected being german spy many liberal harvard colleagues disassociated themselves
there also threats against life
remained harvard professor experimental psychology director psychological laboratory until sudden death possibly due stress 1916 while lecture platform
scholarship comparisons wundt james major point disagreement wundt münsterberg their opposing views how psychology should practiced
wundt psychology should pure science detached practical concerns while münsterberg wanted apply psychological principles applied practical concerns
while working wundt's research assistant münsterberg studying voluntary activities through introspection however disagreed fundamental principles
wundt believed free will experienced conscious element mind during introspection while münsterberg
münsterberg believed prepare act consciously experience bodily preparedness mistakenly interpret will act certain way
münsterberg beliefs support interpretation james's ideo-motor theory behavior
münsterberg behavior causes ideas
however james ideas cause behavior
there also similarities james's theory emotion münsterberg's analysis voluntary behavior
james-lange theory emotion emotions by-products bodily reactions elicited situation
whereas münsterberg feeling willful actions results awareness covert behavior readiness act overtly elicited situation
both cases conscious experience result behavior
1900 published basics psychology dedicated james
later münsterberg became unhappy james's liberal attitude towards philosophy psychology
unhappy james's acceptance freudian psychoanalysis psychic phenomena religious mysticism area psychology
münsterberg mysticism mediums thing psychology quite another
experimental psychology psychic hocus-pocus mix
applied psychology over time münsterberg's interests turned many practical applications psychological principles felt very strongly psychologists responsibility uncover information then used real world applications
fact first apply psychological principles legal field creating forensic psychology
several papers application psychological information legal situations
main objective most these articles eyewitness testimony examined viability witness testimony
also applied psychological principles field clinical psychology attempting help those ill through variety different treatments
forensic psychology 1908 münsterberg published controversial book witness stand 1908 collection magazine articles previously published discusses many different psychological factors change trial's outcome pointed way rational scientific means probing facts claimed human witnesses application experimental psychology administration law
also credited being among first consider jury research
says lawyer alone obdurate
lawyer judge juryman sure need experimental psychologist
go thinking their legal instinct their common sense supplies them needed somewhat
just line law therefore seems necessary rely simply technical statements scholarly treatises carry discussion most popular form possible before wider tribunal general reader cementing position while lawyer judge jurymen confident their abilities use experimental psychology show just how flawed their thinking really
münsterberg points out various reasons why eye witness testimony inherently unreliable
describes how eye witness testimony inherently susceptible calls illusions subject's perceptions effected circumstances making their memory events transpired testimony inaccurate
states regularity testimony two different individuals same circumstances radically different even neither whom slightest interest changing facts remembered
münsterberg believes because memory things equal easily fallible
because one's memory affected associations judgments suggestions penetrate every one's observations taint out memory our recollection events
münsterberg conducted many experiments normal psychology students basic psychology course while harvard
asked them without any theoretical introduction beginning ordinary lecture write down careful answers number questions referring see hear urged them conscientiously carefully possible
procedure went follows
first show them large sheet white cardboard certain number black dots spread irregular order
exposed students view five seconds then asked them how many black dots thought sheet
results surprising even highly trained careful observers whose attention concentrated material full time quiet scrutiny
there believed saw seven eight times points other saw
conducted similar experiments referred perception time how rapidity estimated descriptions sounds other similar experiments similar results
based results experiments warned against blind confidence observations average normal man concluded cannot rely accuracy normal person's memory
questioned how sure testimony any given witness
portion book calls detection crime discusses many factors influence testimony gain confessions force confession those innocent
münsterberg states brutality still favorite method undermining mental resistance accused
74 discusses ways police time making suspects confess crimes committed including making prisoner's life uncomfortable possible break down her energy worst giving brutal shocks given fiendish cruelty terrified imagination suspect
states method ineffective bringing out real truth
times innocent men accused tortured ones crimes never committed confessed infamous lies invented satisfy demands torturers
clinical psychology münsterberg grounded theory psychophysical parallelism argued physical processes parallel brain process
believed certain mental neurological illnesses cellular-metabolic causation diagnosed based behavioristic observations subject's reactions interviews them
psychotherapy 1909 book authored regard investigations matters mind
defined psychotherapy practice treating sick influencing mental life
perhaps drugs medicines electricity baths diet
trying understand causes abnormal behavior saw many mentally ill people
because seeing them scientific reasons chose charge them services attempted understand causes abnormal behavior
treatment applied mainly cases alcoholism drug addiction phobia sexual dysfunction basically instilling patients idea expect improve result their efforts
also employed reciprocal antagonism you strengthen thoughts opposite behavior causing problems
münsterberg believe psychosis treated because believed caused deterioration nervous system
industrial psychology münsterberg admirer frederick winslow taylor whom 1913 “our aim sketch outlines new science intermediate modern laboratory psychology problem economics
industrial psychology “independent economic opinions debatable
münsterberg's works vocation learning 1912 psychology industrial efficiency 1913 usually considered beginning later become known industrial psychology
books dealt many topics including hiring workers personalities mental abilities best suited certain types vocations best way increase motivation performance retention methods increasing work efficiency marketing advertising techniques
349 paper psychology market 1909 suggested psychology used many different industrial applications including management vocational decisions advertising job performance employee motivation
psychology industrial efficiency 1913 münsterberg addressed many different topics very important current field industrial psychology
objective sketch outlines new science intermediate modern laboratory psychology problems economics psychological experiment systematically placed service commerce industry
selects three points view believes particular importance industrial psychology seeks answer those questions
these three questions include how find men whose mental qualities make them best fitted work secondly under psychological conditions secure greatest most satisfactory output work every man finally how produce most completely influences human minds desired interest business
other words ask how find best possible man how produce best possible work how secure best possible effects
hugo münsterberg
münsterberg most pressing question selection those personalities their mental qualities especially fit particular kind economic work
basically fitting person correct skill set correct position maximize their productivity select those fit personalities reject unfit ones
gives many reasons why it's difficult select place correct person any given vocation many reasons says certain qualities cannot taken alone determine persons fit position including their education training technical abilities recommendation previous employers personal impressions person mental dispositions may still quite undeveloped may unfold under influence special conditions surroundings other side covers habitual traits personality features individual temperament character intelligence ability collected knowledge acquired experience
variations will feeling perception thought attention emotion memory imagination
reality having confidence those prior factors completely unfounded because believes threefold difficulty exists
first place young people know very little themselves their abilities
day comes discover their real strong points their weaknesses often too late
usually drawn current particular vocation given too much energy preparation specific achievement change whole life-plan once
entire scheme education gives individual little chance find himself
mere interest another subject school influenced many accidental circumstances personality teacher methods instruction suggestions surroundings home traditions accordingly even such preference gives rather slight final indication individual mental qualities
moreover such mere inclinations interests cannot determine true psychological fitness vocation
münsterberg points out wandering job another common america notes does certain advantages including failure vocation does bring such serious injury europe contributes much greater danger any may jump recklessly without preparation any vocational stream
therefore sought find psychologically scientific way vocational guidance
describes how two such systems come rise america attempt guide young students leave school chosen vocation newer system marked movement toward scientific management commerce industry
second newer system started boston essentially form career guidance children
member community call meeting neighborhood boys leave elementary school end year discuss them whether any reasonable plans future
clear boys knew little wanted expected them real world leader able give them especially one-one-one conversations valuable advice
knew too little characteristic features vocations wanted devote themselves given hardly any attention question whether necessary qualifications special work
experience office opened 1908 boston children time left school receive individual suggestions reference most reasonable best adjusted selection calling
there hardly any doubt remarkable success modest beginning dependent upon admirable personality late organizer recognized individual features unusual tact acumen
himself no doubt such merely impressionistic method satisfy demands
münsterberg identified three main reasons why worked first because analyzed objective relations hundreds different accessible vocations well children's economic hygienic technical social elements should examined every child receive valuable information demands vocation opportunities found within vocation
second schools interested question vocational choice observations individual child made their abilities interests
finally believed most important point methods elaborated such way personal traits dispositions might discovered much greater exactitude much richer detail possible through mere call vocational counselor unveil
münsterberg believes these early vocational counselors point towards spirit modern tendency toward applied psychology goal reached through exact scientific experimental research mere naïve methods -- instance filling-out questionnaires may quite useful first approach -- cannot sufficient real persistent furtherance economic life masses seek their vocations
question selecting best possible man particular vocation münsterberg comes down making process very scientific trying create tests limit subjectivity possible through traditional techniques introspection instead using measurements ones personality intelligence other inherent personality traits try find best possible job every individual
münsterberg also explored under psychological conditions employer secure most highest quality output work every employee looking effects changing work space environment possibly effect workers production problems monotony factory other vocations involve tedious repeated tasks how avoid these situation studied attention fatigue workplace physical social influences working power
finally investigating how company secure best possible effects terms sales
münsterberg talks ways study satisfaction economic demands experiments discovering effectiveness advertisements psychology buying selling end discusses future development economic psychology
women education münsterberg's views women frequently criticized modern period
though firmly believed women should receive possible higher education felt graduate studies too difficult demanding them
well suggesting women should allowed serve juries because
incapable rational deliberation
contributions film theory both dudley andrew james monaco count münsterberg's book photoplay psychological study early examples film theory
spiritualism though believed god life after death münsterberg throughout career committed opponent parapsychology field study concerned investigation paranormal psychic phenomena include telepathy clairvoyance near-death experiences reincarnation
denied veracity parapsychology science worked prove seemingly paranormal activity fact fraudulent very opposed spiritualism
great record exposing mediums other psychic charlatans
notable episode facet career involved exposure fraudulent mediumship eusapia palladino world-famous clairvoyant spiritualist medium claimed she communicate dead fooled many famous psychologists sceptics up till time
18 december 1909 new york help hidden man lying under table münsterberg caught palladino levitating table her foot
investigators originally baffled how palladino move curtains distance doors windows séance room closed
according münsterberg she moved curtains releasing jet air rubber bulb she her hand
