she specializes neurophysiology vision acquires let us suppose physical information there obtain goes see ripe tomatoes sky use terms like 'red' 'blue'
she discovers example just wavelength combinations sky stimulate retina exactly how produces via central nervous system contraction vocal cords expulsion air lungs results uttering sentence 'the sky blue'
… will happen mary released her black white room given color television monitor? will she learn anything not? seems just obvious she will learn something world our visual experience
