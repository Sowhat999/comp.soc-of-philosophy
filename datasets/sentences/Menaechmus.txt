menaechmus greek μέναιχμος 380–320 bc ancient greek mathematician geometer born alopeconnesus thracian chersonese known friendship renowned philosopher plato apparent discovery conic sections solution then-long-standing problem doubling cube using parabola hyperbola
contents life work 2 references 3 sources 4 external links life work menaechmus remembered mathematicians discovery conic sections solution problem doubling cube
menaechmus likely discovered conic sections ellipse parabola hyperbola by-product search solution delian problem
menaechmus knew parabola y² = lx l constant called latus rectum although aware fact any equation two unknowns determines curve
apparently derived these properties conic sections others well
using information now possible find solution problem duplication cube solving points two parabolas intersect solution equivalent solving cubic equation
there few direct sources menaechmus's work work conic sections known primarily epigram eratosthenes accomplishment brother devising method create square equal area given circle using quadratrix dinostratus known solely writings proclus
proclus also mentions menaechmus taught eudoxus
there curious statement plutarch effect plato disapproved menaechmus achieving doubled cube solution use mechanical devices proof currently known appears purely algebraic
menaechmus tutor alexander great belief derives following anecdote supposedly once alexander asked shortcut understanding geometry replied o king traveling over country there royal road roads common citizens geometry there road
beckmann history pi 1989 p
34 however quote first attested stobaeus 500 ad whether menaechmus really taught alexander uncertain
precisely died uncertain well though modern scholars believe eventually expired cyzicus

eutocius proclus both attribute discovery conic sections menaechmus lived athens late fourth century
proclus quoting eratosthenes refers conic section triads menaechmus
since quotation comes just after discussion section right-angled cone section acute-angled cone inferred conic sections produced cutting cone plane perpendicular elements
then vertex angle cone acute resulting section calledoxytome ellipse

consequently signal achievement part menaechmus disclosed curves having desired property near hand
fact there family appropriate curves obtained single source - cutting right circular cone plane perpendicular element cone
menaechmus reputed discovered curves later known ellipse parabola hyperbola
yet first discovery ellipse seems made menaechmus mere by-product search parabola hyperbola proffered properties needed solution delian problem

op=y od = x coordinates point p y<sup2 = r
ov substituting equals y2 = r'd
ov = ar'
bc/ab = ar'
much segments ar' bc ab same points p curve eqdpg write equation curve section right-angled cone y2=lx l constant later known latus rectum curve
menaechmus apparently derived these properties conic sections others well
since material strong resemblance use coordinates illustrated above sometimes maintains menaechmus analytic geometry
such judgment warranted part certainly menaechmus unaware any equation two unknown quantities determines curve
fact general concept equation unknown quantities alien greek thought
hit upon conics successful search curves properties appropriate duplication cube
terms modern notation solution easily achieved
shifting cutting plane fig
2 find parabola any latus rectum
then wish duplicate cube edge locate right-angled cone two parabolas latus rectum another latus rectum 2
probable menaechmus knew duplication achieved also use rectangular hyperbola parabola
