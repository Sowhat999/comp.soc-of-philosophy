also published poet
gebser died wabern bei bern may 14 1973 soft knowing smile
[a] personal letters publications held gebser archives university oklahoma history science collections norman oklahoma bizzel libraries
consciousness transition gebser's major thesis human consciousness transition these transitions mutations continuous
these jumps transformations involve structural changes both mind body
gebser held previous consciousness structures continue operate parallel emergent structure
consciousness presence being present gebser understands term conscious neither knowledge nor conscience must understood time being broadest sense wakeful presence
[b] each consciousness structure eventually becomes deficient replaced following structure
stress chaos europe 1914 1945 symptoms structure consciousness end effectiveness heralded birth new form consciousness
first evidence witnessed novel use language literature
modified position 1943 include changes occurring arts sciences time
thesis failure structure consciousness alongside emergence new led inquire whether such occurred before
work ursprung und gegenwart result inquiry
published various editions 1949 1953 translated english ever-present origin
working historical evidence almost every major field e
poetry music visual arts architecture philosophy religion physics other natural sciences etc
gebser saw traces emergence called efficiency collapse deficiency various structures consciousness throughout history
structures consciousness gebser distinguished following structures archaic structure magic structure mythical structure mental structure integral structure archaic structure archaic structure first structure consciousness emerge ever-present origin term archaic used here derived greek arce meaning inception origin
origin ursprung original german source springs springs forth itself
essence behind underlies consciousness
no direct information structure available inferred writings later times
zero-dimensional consciousness dimly lit mist devoid shadows
individual totally identical whole human being totally immersed world unable extricate himself herself world
identical world
magic structure magical structure events objects persons magically related
symbols statues just represent those events objects persons those same objects persons
gebser symbolizes one-dimensional consciousness structure space-less time-less point
unlike archaic structure there perfect identity man universe man aware nature something within community must listen act order survive
mythical structure gebser symbolizes two-dimensional mythical structure circle cyclical time based man's discovery rhythmic recurrence natural events inner reflections experience those events
[w]hereas distinguishing characteristic magic structure emergent awareness nature essential characteristic mythical structure emergent awareness soul
mythical structure events objects persons woven together stories
mythologies give coherence consciousness
important element myth polarity etymology myth itself implies both speaking mouth mythos silence mute myein
gebser explains polarity makes myth particularly foreign mental consciousness structure acknowledge both meanings root discern fundamental nature mythical structure
taken together elemental ambivalence rational contradiction constitutive mythical structure
mental world requires laws mythical world secure polarity neither knows nor needs them
mental structure mental structure appropriates events objects persons use logic
efficient form mental structure three-dimensional
gebser symbolizes triangle illustrates trinity thesis antithesis synthesis base triangle two points lying opposition represents dual contraries antinomies unified point apex
gebser essence emergence directed discursive thought western science built
required centuries sufficiently devitalize demythologize word able express distinct concepts freed wealth imagery well reach rationalistic extreme word once power [magic] later image [myth] degraded mere formula
deficient form mental structure gebser called 'rational' structure
rational structure awareness seeks deny other structures claim humans exclusively rational
rational structure known extremes evidenced various nothing
extreme materialism claims everything nothing matter — atoms
philosophy love wisdom replaced instrumental reason ability make
contemplation—looking inward—is devalued relation
wise men fall out favor replaced man action
successes technologically re-shaping matter offer solutions problems also give rise problems their own making
mechanized slaughter two world wars new atomic weapons exemplified symbolized expression ontology rational/mental structure
living becomes hard bear such consciousness structure
saw cause despair lack values ethics
gebser saw very consciousness structure itself played out inherent end
saw metaphysical presumptions necessarily led ethical dead end
value-free ontology like materialism leads necessity living without value
any attempt remedy situation return values ultimately fail
through very quagmire decline west gebser saw emergence new structure consciousness termed integral
integral structure integral consciousness structure made evident new relationship space time
second part work gebser set out document evidence saw throughout various human endeavors
note here incorporation time physics attempts paint time visual arts like
gebser noticed integral structure consciousness largely witnessed irruption time fixed-reality mental structure
gebser dualistically opposed static categories being gave way transparency
transparency points how given-through along-with other
centuries time viewed having distinct categories past present future
these categories wholly distinct other
course created kinds difficulties regarding how beings moved category other — present past example
integral awareness notices though may utilize categorical thinking various purposes also realization time indivisible whole
various beings present crystallized past also extend future
fact without already having integral awareness no notion time past present etc
without awareness whole stuck kind not-knowing now connected any sense past future
even mental awareness divides whole distinct categories become aware those categories without awareness already integral
thus awareness already integral
gebser introduced notion presentiation means make something present through transparency
aspect integral awareness presentiation making present various structures awareness
rather allowing rational structure valid structures recognized presented through other
awareness acceptance various structures enables live through various structures rather subjected them lived them german
realize various structures within one's language habits even within one's own life self difficult task
gebser says task cannot choose ignore without losing ourselves
means our so-called objective thinking without consequences innocent
live objectively means give life horrors nihilism combined know how highly efficient weapons
means objectivity gets applied engineering humanity whether behavioral sciences physical sciences
asks us whether our fill those horrors yet
willing settle comfort our daily life take process change? offers guiding note just there also time act there also much neglected time contemplation
world know-how overvalued simple knowing must also nurtured
furthermore knew thought never simply mental exercise restricted one's writing
calls upon us realize think
terminology discontinuity gebser cautioned against using terms like evolution progression development describe changes structures consciousness described
gebser traces evidence transformations structure consciousness concretized historical artifacts
sought avoid calling process evolutionary since any such notion illusory applied unfolding consciousness
gebser emphasized biological evolution enclosing process particularizes species limited environment
unfolding awareness contrast opening-up
any attempt give direction goal unfolding awareness illusory based upon limited mentalistic linear notion time
gebser notes progress move toward something thus also move away something else therefore progress inappropriate term describe structures consciousness
gebser question fate humanity still open become closed ultimate tragedy such closure remains possibility
gebser our fate assured any notion evolution toward any kind ideal way being
space time gebser notes various structures consciousness revealed their relationship space time
example mythical structure embodies time cyclical/rhythmic space enclosed
mental structure lives time linear directed progressive space becomes box-like vacuum-like homogeneous space geometry

wilber found gebser's 'pioneering' work align own model consciousness although wilber finds evidence additional later mystical stages beyond gebser's integral structure
