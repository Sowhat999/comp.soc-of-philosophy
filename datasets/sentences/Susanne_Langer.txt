langer died old lyme connecticut july 17 1985 after finishing third volume her magnum opus mind essay human feeling
philosophy langer's philosophy explored continuous process meaning-making human mind through power “seeing” thing terms another
langer's first major work entitled philosophy new key
put forth idea become commonplace today there basic pervasive human need symbolize invent meanings invest meanings one’s world
beginning critique positivism work study human thought progressing semantic theory through philosophy music sketching theory arts
langer human mind constantly carrying process symbolic transformation experiential data come causing veritable fountain less spontaneous ideas
langer's distinction discursive versus presentational symbols her better known concepts
discursive symbolization arranges elements necessarily words stable context invariant meanings new meaning
presentation symbolization operates independently elements fixed stable meanings
presentation cannot comprehended progressively building up understanding parts isolation
must understood whole
example element used painting may used articulate entirely different meaning another
same principle applies note musical arrangement—such elements independently no fixed meaning except context their entire presentation
langer believed symbolism central concern philosophy because underlies human knowing understanding
ernst cassirer langer believed distinguishes humans animals capacity using symbols
while animal life dominated feeling human feeling mediated conceptions symbols language
animals respond signs stimulus sign significantly complex humans
perspective also associated symbolic communication animal societies studied help understand how symbolic communication affects conduct members cooperating group
power understanding symbols
regarding everything sense-datum irrelevant except certain form embodies most characteristic mental trait mankind
issues unconscious spontaneous process abstraction goes time human mind process recognizing concept any configuration given experience forming conception accordingly

”— susanne langer philosophy new key page 58 langer earliest philosophers paid close attention concept virtual
inspired henri bergson's notions matter memory she connected art concept virtual
her figuring out space art work creator no less building virtual world
she describes virtuality quality things created perceived
her virtual matter consciousness something external created intentionally existing materially space contemplation outside human mind
langer sees virtuality physical space created artist such painting building “significant itself part surroundings
she particularly considers architecture realization space being conceptual translation virtuality perceiving “the architect fine deals created space virtual entity
contrast bergson langer virtuality tangible cause contemplative interaction humans machine
her later years langer came believe decisive task her work construct science psychology based theory life mind using process philosophy conventions
langer's final work mind essay human feeling represents culmination her attempt establish philosophical scientific underpinning aesthetic experience relying three volume survey comprehensive set relevant humanistic scientific texts
rhetoric susanne langer's work symbolism meaning led her association contemporary rhetoric although her influence field somewhat debated
langer established use symbols epistemic unit community suggesting knowledge community gained built shared symbol-systems within given culture
langer's concept regarding language dialogue may understood imply language does simply communicate produces symbols humans then create their own reality
claimed support perspective comes langer's statement language intrinsic thinking imagining even our ways perceiving
according arabella lyon langer holds meaning arises relationship community discourse individual
lyon suggests langer's work may viewed contradiction comparatively traditional theories aristotle way langer's argument discourse forms through sensory experiences shared speaker hearer rather through logic advocated philosopher
langer's epistemic view symbolism language further examines motivation speaker influential aspects language affect people relationship speaker community often reflected aspects modern rhetorical studies
