139–140 widely assumed past word hellene began having ‘national’ sense later especially hellenistic times came mean ‘possessing greek culture’
instance ptolemaic roman egypt hellenes also known οἱ ἀπὸ τοῦ γυμνασίου ‘those gymnasium’ frequently non-greek names
tebtunis list five ἑλλήνων γεωργ[ῶν] ‘greek farmers’ whom greek name
’ thought beginning extension meaning word traced fourth century isocrates wrote”‘athens become teacher other cities made name greek τὸ τῶν ἑλλήνων ὄνομα no longer mark race γένος intellect διάνοια those share our upbringing τῆς παιδεύσεως rather our common nature τῆς κοινῆς φύσεως called hellenes
’ passage attracted great attention jaeger going far claim ‘a higher ǁ justification new national imperialism identifies specifically greek universally human’
‘without idea [isocrates] here expresses first time’ continues ‘
there no macedonian greek world-empire universal culture call hellenistic never existed
’ unfortunately claim shown” passage isocrates extending term hellene non-greeks restricting application effect saying ‘hellenes no longer share γένος common φύσις greek people hitherto those gone school athens henceforth greece” equivalent athens her cultural following
’ thus isocrates gives term cultural value cannot regarded initiating wider concept hellas

383–384 telos towards whole encomium directed neither military nor material cultural particular linguistic toiio4 ia[clarification needed] isocrates’ plato’s sense athens’s gift world eloquence distinguishes men animals liberally educated men
uncultured ones honoured city any other
thus isocrates claim above domain language athens become school rest world “and far our city distanced rest mankind thought speech her pupils become teachers rest world she brought name ‘hellenes’ suggests no longer race intelligence title ‘hellenes’ applied rather those share our culture those share common blood like pericles’ funeral oration thucydides upon section panegyricus closely modelled isocrates’ panegyric emphasizes abstract cultural values ultimate goal fact concretely military speech whole aims convincing other greek cities grant athens hegemony leadership expedition against persians will reunite greeks distracting them their internecine warfare
athens’s present military weakness wake peace antalcidas 387
deprives isocrates easiest argument leadership should given city greatest military strength
hence must appeal past military culturall glories order justify present claims—indeed evident reuse themes pericles’ funeral oration part same rhetorical strategy designed remind fourth-century pan-hellenic readers athens’s fifth-century glory
passes itself off here disinterested praise city fact canny self-advertisement successful businessman isocrates’ climactic celebration athenian philosophy eloquence little thinly disguised panegyric saw very own contribution athenian greek world culture

63–64 crafts onto predecessor’s analogy athens school hellas enduring bond among hellenes great divide them persians athens’ pupils become teachers rest world” “the title ‘hellenes’ applied rather those share our culture those share common blood” 50
cultural links pericles named uniting athenians their allies lies together refigured here rhetorically way forges symbolic unification among cities hellas including sparta allied states
relying same time changing pericles’ wise words isocrates creates perception athens having unified greek city-stares very beginning thereby makes perception part parcel athens’ glorious history
result rhetorical engagement conventional wisdom current concerns pan-hellenism find their way city’s timeless traditions
capitalizing propensity epideictic language amplify augment lsocrates finesses stable doxa community enlarges boundaries accommodate less stable doxa present
