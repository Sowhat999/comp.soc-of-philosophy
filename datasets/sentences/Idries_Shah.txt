tahir shah mentions father's storytelling several points throughout 2008 book arabian nights first discuss how idries shah made use teaching stories my father never us how stories worked
reveal layers nuggets information fragments truth fantasy
didn't need because given right conditions stories activated sowing themselves
then explains how father used these stories impart wisdom my father tale hand divert our attention use way transmitting idea thought
used say great collections stories east like encyclopedias storehouses wisdom knowledge ready studied appreciated cherished
stories represented much mere entertainment
saw them complex psychological documents forming body knowledge collected refined since dawn humanity often passed down word mouth
later book continues discussion stories teaching tools quoting following explanation father gave end story these stories technical documents like maps kind blueprints
show people how use maps because forgotten
you may think it's strange way teach stories long ago way people passed wisdom
everyone knew how take wisdom story
see through layers same way you see fish frozen block ice
world living lost skill skill certainly once
hear stories like them because stories amuse them make them feel warm
can't see past first layer ice
stories like lovely chessboard know how play chess drawn game complicated our faculties drained
imagine game lost society centuries then fine chessboard pieces found
everyone cluster round see them praise them
might never imagine such fine object ever purpose other entertain eyes
stories' inner value lost same way
time everyone knew how play them how decipher them
now rules forgotten
us show people again how game played
— tahir shah arabian nights olav hammer sufism europe north america 2004 cites example such story
tells man looking key ground
passing neighbour asks man whether fact place lost key man replies no lost home there light here my own house
peter wilson writing new trends developments world islam 1998 quotes another such story featuring dervish asked describe qualities teacher alim
dervish explains alim beautiful poetry inspired self-sacrifice service fellow man
questioner readily approves these qualities find dervish rebuking those qualities recommended alim you
then proceeds list qualities actually enabled alim effective teacher hazrat alim azimi made me irritated caused me examine my irritation trace source
alim azimi made me angry feel transform my anger
explains alim azimi followed path blame intentionally provoking vicious attacks upon himself order bring failings both students critics light allowing them seen really showed us strange strange became commonplace realise really
views culture practical life shah's concern reveal essentials underlying cultures hidden factors determining individual behaviour
