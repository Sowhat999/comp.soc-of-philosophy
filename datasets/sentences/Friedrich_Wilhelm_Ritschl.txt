results ritschl's life mainly gathered up long series monographs most part highest finish rich ideas leavened scholarship time
scholarship scholar ritschl lineage bentley whom looked up like hermann fervent admiration
best efforts spent studying languages literatures greece rome rather life greeks romans
sometimes most unjustly charged taking narrow view philology
keenly appreciated importance ancient institutions ancient art both published papers records lectures amply testify
devoted himself most part study ancient poetry particular early latin drama
formed centre investigations radiated
starting ranged over whole remains pre-ciceronian latin analysed augmented sources our knowledge must come
before ritschl acquaintance scholars early latin dim restricted perhaps hardly exaggeration call real discoverer
plautus world general ritschl best known student plautus
cleared away accretions ages efforts real genius goes hand hand labor brought light many true features original
infinitely regretted ritschl's results never combined form monumental edition plautus dreamed earlier life
ritschl's examination plautine manuscripts both laborious brilliant greatly extended knowledge plautus ancient latin drama
two striking examples may cited
aid ambrosian palimpsest recovered name t maccius plautus vulgate m accius proved correct strong extraneous arguments
margin palatine manuscripts marks c dv continually recur variously explained
ritschl proved meant canticum diverbium hence showed roman comedy conversations iambic senarii intended singing voice
thus brought strong relief fact without there no true appreciation plautus viz
plays comic operas rather comic dramas
conjectural criticism ritschl inferior great predecessors contemporaries
imagination field field hampered erudition judgment unconsciously warped desire find text illustrations discoveries
still fair proportion textual labours stood test time rendered immense service study plautine metres field little advance made since time bentley
matter ritschl aided accomplishment rare himself lamented germany art writing latin verse
spite incompleteness many sides work ritschl must assigned place history learning among very select few

recommendation nietzsche ritschl recommended student friedrich nietzsche considered position professor
described nietzsche following words
however many young talents seen develop under my eyes thirty-nine years now never yet known young man tried help along my field best mature early young nietzsche
museum articles second third year triennium
first whom ever accepted any contribution while still student
— god grant — lives long enough prophesy will day stand front rank german philology
now twenty-four years old strong vigorous healthy courageous physically morally constituted impress those similar nature
top possesses enviable gift presenting ideas talking freely calmly speaks skillfully clearly
idol without wishing leader whole younger generation philologists here leipzig — rather numerous — cannot wait hear lecturer
you will say describe phenomenon
well just — same time pleasant modest
also gifted musician irrelevant here
nietzsche specifically political nature
may general whole sympathy growing greatness germany like myself no special tendre [fondness] prussianism yet vivid feeling free civic spiritual development thus certainly heart your swiss institutions way living
am say? studies far weighted toward history greek literature course including critical exegetical treatment authors special emphasis seems me history greek philosophy
least doubt confronted practical demand great gifts will work other fields best success
will simply able anything wants
walter kaufmann described unusual situation follows
nietzsche yet fulfilled residence requirement hence no doctorate
ritschl expected case hopeless 'although present instance' 'i should stake my whole philological academic reputation matter work out happily
hardly surprising basel decided ignore 'formal insufficiency
ritschl delighted 'in germany sort thing happens absolutely never
nietzsche beginning lose interest philology time due intense interests science wagner's music schopenhauer's philosophy
kaufmann continued call university basel came surprise nietzsche yet received doctorate though published fruits research scholarly journal
actually considered giving up philology science ritschl's recommendation appointed professor classical philology basel leipzig hurriedly conferred doctorate without examination
nietzsche's consuming interest philosophy however soon overcame work philology
first published book birth tragedy effectively ended career professor
ritschl dismissed book geistreich schwiemelei clever giddiness
few students attended nietzsche's classes retired due physical disability age thirty five
ritschl's prophecy direct opposite course events
