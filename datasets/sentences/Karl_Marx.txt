marx sought understand inner workings capitalism
outline marxism definitely formed mind karl marx late 1844
indeed many features marxist view world's political economy worked out great detail
however marx needed write down details economic world view further clarify new economic theory own mind
accordingly marx economic philosophical manuscripts

however spring 1845 continued study political economy capital capitalism led marx belief new political economic theory espousing—scientific socialism—needed built base thoroughly developed materialistic view world
economic philosophical manuscripts 1844 written april august 1844

goes examine antagonisms marx claimed arising clashes interest bourgeoisie wealthy capitalist class proletariat industrial working class
proceeding manifesto presents argument why communist league opposed other socialist liberal political parties groups time truly acting interests proletariat overthrow capitalist society replace socialism

willich schapper believed once communist league initiated uprising entire working class across europe rise spontaneously join thus creating revolution across europe
marx engels protested such unplanned uprising part communist league adventuristic suicide communist league
such uprising recommended schapper/willich group easily crushed police armed forces reactionary governments europe
marx maintained spell doom communist league itself
changes society marx argued achieved overnight through efforts will power handful men
instead brought through scientific analysis economic conditions society moving toward revolution through different stages social development
present stage development circa 1850 following defeat uprisings across europe 1848 marx felt communist league should encourage working class unite progressive elements rising bourgeoisie defeat feudal aristocracy issues involving demands governmental reforms such constitutional republic freely elected assemblies universal male suffrage
other words working class must join bourgeois democratic forces bring successful conclusion bourgeois revolution before stressing working class agenda working class revolution
after long struggle threatened ruin communist league marx's opinion prevailed eventually willich/schapper group left communist league
meanwhile marx also became heavily involved socialist german workers' educational society
society held their meetings great windmill street soho central london's entertainment district

marx just reporters europe new york tribune employed
however slavery crisis united states coming head late 1850 s outbreak american civil war 1861 american public's interest european affairs declined

though inspired french socialist sociological thought marx criticised utopian socialists arguing their favoured small-scale socialistic communities bound marginalisation poverty large-scale change economic system bring real change
other important contribution marx's revision hegelianism came engels's book condition working class england 1844 led marx conceive historical dialectic terms class conflict see modern working class most progressive force revolution
marx believed study history society scientifically discern tendencies history resulting outcome social conflicts
followers marx concluded therefore communist revolution inevitably occur
however marx famously asserted eleventh theses feuerbach philosophers interpreted world various ways point however change clearly dedicated himself trying alter world
philosophy social thought marx's polemic other thinkers often occurred through critique thus called first great user critical method social sciences
criticised speculative philosophy equating metaphysics ideology
adopting approach marx attempted separate key findings ideological biases
set apart many contemporary philosophers
human nature further information marx's theory human nature philosophers g
hegel ludwig feuerbach whose ideas dialectics heavily influenced marx like tocqueville described faceless bureaucratic despotism no identifiable despot marx also broke classical thinkers spoke single tyrant montesquieu discussed nature single despot
instead marx set out analyse despotism capital
fundamentally marx assumed human history involves transforming human nature encompasses both human beings material objects
humans recognise possess both actual potential selves
both marx hegel self-development begins experience internal alienation stemming recognition followed realisation actual self subjective agent renders potential counterpart object apprehended
marx further argues moulding nature desired ways subject takes object own thus permits individual actualised fully human
marx then human nature—gattungswesen species-being—exists function human labour
fundamental marx's idea meaningful labour proposition order subject come terms alienated object must first exert influence upon literal material objects subject's world
marx acknowledges hegel grasps nature work comprehends objective man authentic because actual result own work characterises hegelian self-development unduly spiritual abstract
marx thus departs hegel insisting fact man corporeal actual sentient objective being natural capacities means actual sensuous objects nature objects life-expression express life actual sensuous objects
consequently marx revises hegelian work material labour context human capacity transform nature term labour power
labour class struggle false consciousness further information labour theory value history hitherto existing society history class struggles
— karl marx communist manifesto marx special concern how people relate their own labour power
extensively terms problem alienation
dialectic marx began hegelian notion alienation developed materialist conception
capitalism mediates social relationships production such among workers workers capitalists through commodities including labour bought sold market
marx possibility may give up ownership one's own labour—one's capacity transform world—is tantamount being alienated one's own nature spiritual loss
marx described loss commodity fetishism things people produce commodities appear life movement their own humans their behaviour merely adapt
commodity fetishism provides example engels called false consciousness relates closely understanding ideology
ideology marx engels meant ideas reflect interests particular class particular time history contemporaries see universal eternal
marx engels's point such beliefs best half-truths serve important political function
put another way control class exercises over means production includes production food manufactured goods includes production ideas well provides possible explanation why members subordinate class may hold ideas contrary their own interests
example sort analysis marx's understanding religion summed up passage preface 1843 contribution critique hegel's philosophy right religious suffering same time expression real suffering protest against real suffering
religion sigh oppressed creature heart heartless world soul soulless conditions
opium people
abolition religion illusory happiness people demand their real happiness
call them give up their illusions their condition call them give up condition requires illusions
whereas gymnasium senior thesis argued religion primary social aim promotion solidarity here marx sees social function religion terms highlighting/preserving political economic status quo inequality
economy history society further information marxian economics marx's thoughts labour related primacy gave economic relation determining society's past present future see also economic determinism
accumulation capital shapes social system
social change marx conflict opposing interests driven background economic forces
became inspiration body works known conflict theory
evolutionary model history argued human history began free productive creative work over time coerced dehumanised trend most apparent under capitalism
marx noted intentional process rather no individual even state go against forces economy
organisation society depends means production
literally those things like land natural resources technology necessary production material goods relations production other words social relationships people enter acquire use means production
together these compose mode production marx distinguished historical eras terms distinct modes production
marx differentiated base superstructure base substructure referring economic system superstructure cultural political system
marx regarded mismatch economic base social superstructure major source social disruption conflict
despite marx's stress critique capitalism discussion new communist society should replace explicit critique capitalism guarded saw improved society compared past ones slavery feudal
marx also never clearly discusses issues morality justice although scholars agree work contained implicit discussion those concepts
memorial karl marx moscow
inscription reads proletarians countries unite! marx's view capitalism two-sided
hand marx 19 th century's deepest critique dehumanising aspects system noted defining features capitalism include alienation exploitation recurring cyclical depressions leading mass unemployment other hand capitalism also characterised revolutionising industrialising universalising qualities development growth progressivity marx meant industrialisation urbanisation technological progress increased productivity growth rationality scientific revolution responsible progress
marx considered capitalist class most revolutionary history because constantly improved means production any other class history responsible overthrow feudalism transition capitalism
capitalism stimulate considerable growth because capitalist incentive reinvest profits new technologies capital equipment
according marx capitalists take advantage difference labour market market whatever commodity capitalist produce
marx observed practically every successful industry input unit-costs lower output unit-prices
marx called difference surplus value argued surplus value source surplus labour difference costs keep workers alive produce
marx's dual view capitalism seen description capitalists refers them vampires sucking worker's blood same time notes drawing profit no means injustice capitalists simply cannot go against system
true problem lies cancerous cell capital understood property equipment relations workers owners—the economic system general
same time marx stressed capitalism unstable prone periodic crises
suggested over time capitalists invest new technologies less less labour
since marx believed surplus value appropriated labour source profits concluded rate profit fall even economy grew
marx believed increasingly severe crises punctuate cycle growth collapse growth
moreover believed long-term process necessarily enrich empower capitalist class impoverish proletariat
section communist manifesto marx describes feudalism capitalism role internal social contradictions play historical process see then means production exchange whose foundation bourgeoisie built itself up generated feudal society
certain stage development these means production exchange conditions under feudal society produced exchanged
feudal relations property became no longer compatible already developed productive forces became many fetters
burst asunder burst asunder
their place stepped free competition accompanied social political constitution adapted economic political sway bourgeois class
similar movement going before our own eyes
productive forces disposal society no longer tend further development conditions bourgeois property contrary become too powerful these conditions fettered soon overcome these fetters bring order whole bourgeois society endanger existence bourgeois property
marx believed industrial workers proletariat rise up around world
marx believed those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate end giving way socialism post-capitalistic communist society development modern industry therefore cuts under feet very foundation bourgeoisie produces appropriates products
bourgeoisie therefore produces above own grave-diggers
fall victory proletariat equally inevitable
thanks various processes overseen capitalism such urbanisation working class proletariat should grow numbers develop class consciousness time realising change system
marx believed proletariat seize means production encourage social relations benefit everyone equally abolishing exploiting class introduce system production less vulnerable cyclical crises
marx argued german ideology capitalism will end through organised actions international working class communism us state affairs established ideal reality will adjust itself
call communism real movement abolishes present state things
conditions movement result premises now existence
new society self-alienation end humans free act without being bound labour market
democratic society enfranchising entire population
such utopian world there also little any need state goal enforce alienation
theorised capitalism establishment socialist/communist system dictatorship proletariat—a period working class holds political power forcibly socialises means production—would exist
critique gotha program capitalist communist society there lies period revolutionary transformation other
corresponding also political transition period state nothing revolutionary dictatorship proletariat
while allowed possibility peaceful transition countries strong democratic institutional structures such britain us netherlands suggested other countries strong centralised state-oriented traditions like france germany lever our revolution must force
