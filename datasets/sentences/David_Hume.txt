writings introduction treatise human nature hume 'tis evident sciences relation less human nature
even mathematics natural philosophy natural religion measure dependent science man
also science man solid foundation other sciences method science requires both experience observation foundations logical argument
aspect hume's thought philosophical historian frederick copleston hume's aim apply science man method experimental philosophy term current time imply natural philosophy hume's plan extend philosophy general methodological limitations newtonian physics
until recently hume seen forerunner logical positivism form anti-metaphysical empiricism
according logical positivists unless statement verified experience else true false definition
either tautological contradictory then meaningless summary statement their verification principle
hume view proto-positivist philosophical writings attempted demonstrate how ordinary propositions objects causal relations self semantically equivalent propositions one's experiences
[not citation given] many commentators since rejected understanding humean empiricism stressing epistemological rather semantic reading project
according opposing view hume's empiricism consisted idea our knowledge our ability conceive restricted experienced
hume thought form beliefs extends beyond any possible experience through operation faculties such custom imagination sceptical claims knowledge basis
impressions ideas most central doctrines hume's philosophy stated very first lines treatise notion mind consists mental perceptions mental objects present divide two categories impressions ideas
hume's treatise thus opens words 'all perceptions human mind resolve themselves two distinct kinds shall call impressions ideas
hume states believe will very necessary employ many words explaining distinction commentators generally taken hume mean distinction feeling thinking
controversially hume may regard difference sense matter degree takes impressions distinguished ideas basis their force liveliness vivacity henry allison calls flv criterion book hume
ideas therefore faint impressions
hume impressions meant original form our ideas don garret thus coined term copy principle refer hume's doctrine ideas ultimately copied original impression whether passion sensation derive
induction causation cornerstone hume's epistemology problem induction
may area hume's thought scepticism human powers reason most pronounced
problem revolves around plausibility inductive reasoning reasoning observed behaviour objects their behaviour unobserved
hume induction concerns how things behave go beyond present testimony senses records our memory
hume argues tend believe things behave regular manner meaning patterns behaviour objects seem persist future throughout unobserved present
hume's argument cannot rationally justify claim nature will continue uniform justification comes two varieties—demonstrative reasoning probable reasoning[note 1]—and both these inadequate
regard demonstrative reasoning hume argues uniformity principle cannot demonstrated consistent conceivable nature might stop being regular
turning probable reasoning hume argues cannot hold nature will continue uniform because past
using very sort reasoning induction under question circular reasoning
thus no form justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences
hume's solution problem argue rather reason natural instinct explains human practice making inductive inferences
asserts nature absolute uncontroulable [sic] necessity determin'd us judge well breathe feel
agreeing philosopher john
kenyon writes reason might manage raise doubt truth conclusion natural inductive inference just moment
sheer agreeableness animal faith will protect us excessive caution sterile suspension belief
commentators such charles sanders peirce demurred hume's solution while such kant karl popper saw hume's analysis posed most fundamental challenge human knowledge claims
notion causation closely linked problem induction
according hume reason inductively associating constantly conjoined events
mental act association basis our concept causation
there least three interpretations hume's theory causation represented literature logical positivist 2 sceptical realist 3 quasi-realist
logical positivist interpretation hume analyses causal propositions such caused terms regularities perception causes equivalent whenever a-type events happen b-type ones follow whenever refers possible perceptions
treatise human nature hume power necessity
qualities perceptions objects
felt soul perceiv'd externally bodies
view rejected sceptical realists argue hume thought causation amounts just regular succession events
hume two events causally conjoined necessary connection underpins conjunction shall rest contented these two relations contiguity succession affording complete idea causation? no means
there necessary connexion taken consideration
philosopher angela coventry writes hume there nothing any particular instance cause effect involving external objects suggests idea power necessary connection ignorant powers operate objects
however while denying possibility knowing powers objects hume accepted causal principle writing never asserted absurd proposition something arise without cause
argued while hume think causation reducible pure regularity fully fledged realist either
philosopher simon blackburn calls quasi-realist reading
blackburn writes someone talking cause voicing distinct mental set no means same state someone merely describing regular sequences
hume's words nothing usual apply external bodies every internal sensation occasion
self statue hume alexander stoddart royal mile edinburgh empiricist philosophers such hume berkeley favoured bundle theory personal identity
theory mind itself far being independent power simply 'a bundle perceptions' without unity cohesive quality
self nothing bundle experiences linked relations causation resemblance accurately empirically warranted idea self just idea such bundle
view forwarded example positivist interpreters saw hume suggesting terms such self person mind referred collections sense-contents
modern-day version bundle theory mind advanced derek parfit reasons persons
however philosophers criticised hume's bundle-theory interpretation personal identity
argue distinct selves perceptions stand relations similarity causality another
thus perceptions must already come parcelled distinct bundles before associated according relations similarity causality
other words mind must already possess unity cannot generated constituted these relations alone
since bundle-theory interpretation portrays hume answering ontological question philosophers like galen strawson see hume very concerned such questions queried whether view really hume's
instead suggested strawson hume might answering epistemological question causal origin our concept self
appendix treatise hume declares himself dissatisfied earlier account personal identity book
philosopher corliss swain notes commentators agree hume find new problem reviewed section personal identity wasn't forthcoming nature appendix
interpretation hume's view self argued philosopher psychologist james giles
according view hume arguing bundle theory form reductionism rather eliminative view self
rather reducing self bundle perceptions hume rejecting idea self altogether
interpretation hume proposing no-self theory thus much common buddhist thought
point psychologist alison gopnik argued hume position learn buddhist thought during time france 1730 s
practical reason hume's anti-rationalism informed much theory belief knowledge well treatment notions induction causation external world
confined sphere also permeated theories motivation action morality
famous sentence treatise hume circumscribes reason's role production action reason ought slave passions never pretend any other office serve obey them
hume's anti-rationalism defended contemporary philosophy action neo-humeans such michael smith simon blackburn
opposed cognitivists such john mc dowell concerned act reason kantians such christine korsgaard
ethics see also is–ought problem hume's writings ethics began treatise refined enquiry concerning principles morals 1751
views ethics [m]oral decisions grounded moral sentiment
knowing governs ethical actions feelings
arguing reason cannot behind morality morals excite passions produce prevent actions
reason itself utterly impotent particular
rules morality therefore conclusions our reason
hume's sentimentalism morality shared close friend adam smith[not citation given] hume smith mutually influenced moral reflections their older contemporary francis hutcheson
peter singer claims hume's argument morals cannot rational basis alone enough earn place history ethics
hume also put forward is–ought problem later called hume's law denying possibility logically deriving ought
treatise every system morality read author begins stating facts world then suddenly referring ought case
hume demands reason should given inferring ought case case
because seems altogether inconceivable how new relation deduction others
hume's theory ethics influential modern day meta-ethical theory helping inspire emotivism ethical expressivism non-cognitivism[not citation given] well allan gibbard's general theory moral judgment judgments rationality
aesthetics hume's ideas aesthetics theory art spread throughout works particularly connected ethical writings also essays standard taste tragedy
views rooted work joseph addison francis hutcheson
treatise connection beauty deformity vice virtue later writings subject continue draw parallels beauty deformity art conduct character
standard taste hume argues no rules drawn up tasteful object
however reliable critic taste recognised being objective sensible unprejudiced having extensive experience
tragedy addresses question why humans enjoy tragic drama
hume concerned way spectators find pleasure sorrow anxiety depicted tragedy
argued because spectator aware witnessing dramatic performance
there pleasure realising terrible events being shown actually fiction
furthermore hume laid down rules educating people taste correct conduct writings area very influential english anglo-saxon aesthetics
free will determinism responsibility hume along thomas hobbes cited classical compatibilist notions freedom determinism
thesis compatibilism seeks reconcile human freedom mechanist belief human beings part deterministic universe whose happenings governed physical laws
hume end influenced greatly scientific revolution particular sir isaac newton
hume argued dispute compatibility freedom determinism continued over two thousand years ambiguous terminology
circumstance alone controversy long kept foot
may presume there ambiguity expression different disputants use different meanings same terms
hume defines concept necessity uniformity observable operations nature similar objects constantly conjoined together liberty power acting acting according determinations will
then argues according these definitions two compatible liberty requires necessity
our actions necessitated above sense little connexion motives inclinations circumstances does follow certain degree uniformity other
our actions thus connected will then our actions never free matters chance universally allowed no existence
australian philosopher john passmore writes confusion arisen because necessity taken mean necessary connexion
once abandoned hume argues liberty necessity will found conflict another
moreover hume goes argue order held morally responsible required our behaviour caused necessitated actions their very nature temporary perishing proceed cause character disposition person performed them neither redound honour good nor infamy evil
hume describes link causality our capacity rationally make decision inference mind
human beings assess situation based upon certain predetermined events form choice
hume believes choice made spontaneously
hume calls form decision making liberty spontaneity
education writer richard wright considers hume's position rejects famous moral puzzle attributed french philosopher jean buridan
buridan's ass puzzle describes donkey hungry
donkey both sides separate bales hay equal distances
problem concerns bale donkey chooses
buridan believe donkey die because no autonomy
donkey incapable forming rational decision there no motive choose bale hay over other
however human beings different because human placed position forced choose loaf bread over another will make decision take lieu other
buridan humans capacity autonomy recognises choice ultimately made will based chance both loaves bread exactly same
however wright says hume completely rejects notion arguing human will spontaneously act such situation because faced impending death fails
such decision made basis chance rather necessity spontaneity given prior predetermined events leading up predicament
hume's argument supported modern day compatibilists such r
hobart pseudonym philosopher dickinson s
however p
strawson argued issue whether hold another morally responsible does ultimately depend truth falsity metaphysical thesis such determinism
because our holding another non-rational human sentiment predicated such theses
writings religion stanford encyclopedia philosophy states hume forcefully incisively almost every central question philosophy religion
various writings concerning problems religion among most important influential contributions topic
writings field cover philosophy psychology history anthropology religious thought
these aspects discussed hume's 1757 dissertation natural history religion
here argued monotheistic religions judaism christianity islam derive earlier polytheistic religions
also suggested religious belief traces end dread unknown
hume also written religious subjects first enquiry well later dialogues concerning natural religion
religious views although great deal religion hume's personal views unclear there much discussion concerning religious position
contemporaries considered atheist least un-christian church scotland seriously considered bringing charges infidelity against
fact contemporaries thought may atheist exemplified story hume liked tell best theologian ever met used say old edinburgh fishwife having recognized hume atheist refused pull out bog fallen until declared christian repeated lord's prayer
however works such superstition enthusiasm hume specifically seems support standard religious views time place
still meant very critical catholic church dismissing standard protestant accusations superstition idolatry well dismissing idolatry compatriots saw uncivilised beliefs
also considered extreme protestant sects members called enthusiasts corrupters religion
contrast natural history religion hume presented arguments suggesting polytheism much commend over monotheism
philosopher paul russell writes likely hume sceptical religious belief extent complete atheism
suggests perhaps hume's position best characterised term irreligion while philosopher david o'connor argues hume's final position weakly deistic
o'connor hume's position deeply ironic
because while inclining towards weak form deism seriously doubts ever find sufficiently favourable balance evidence justify accepting any religious position
adds hume believe god standard theism
rule out concepts deity ambiguity suited purposes creates difficulty definitively pinning down final position religion
design argument traditional topics natural theology existence god posteriori arguments argument design teleological argument
argument existence god proved design obvious complexity world
encyclopaedia britannica states most popular because [it is] most accessible theistic arguments
identifies evidences design nature inferring them divine designer
fact universe whole coherent efficiently functioning system likewise view indicates divine intelligence behind
[unreliable source?] enquiry concerning human understanding hume design argument seems depend upon our experience proponents suppose universe effect quite singular unparalleled proof deity cause no less singular unparalleled
philosopher louise e
loeb notes hume saying experience observation our guide making inferences conjunction events
however according hume observe neither god nor other universes hence no conjunction involving them
there no observed conjunction ground inference either extended objects god unobserved causes
hume also criticised argument dialogues concerning natural religion 1779
suggested even world less smoothly functioning system may result chance permutations particles falling temporary permanent self-sustaining order thus appearance design
century later idea order without design rendered plausible charles darwin's discovery adaptations forms life result natural selection inherited characteristics
philosopher james
madden hume rivaled darwin [who] done most undermine principle our confidence arguments design among figures western intellectual tradition
finally hume discussed version anthropic principle
idea theories universe constrained need allow man's existence observer
hume sceptical mouthpiece philo suggest there may many worlds produced incompetent designer called stupid mechanic
dialogues concerning natural religion hume many worlds might botched bungled throughout eternity ere system struck out much labour lost many fruitless trials made slow continued improvement carried during infinite ages art world-making
american philosopher daniel dennett suggested mechanical explanation teleology although obviously
amusing philosophical fantasy anticipated notion natural selection 'continued improvement' being like any darwinian selection algorithm
problem miracles main article miracles discussion miracles hume argues should believe miracles occurred therefore provide us any reason think god exists
enquiry concerning human understanding section 10 hume defines miracle transgression law nature particular volition deity interposition invisible agent
hume says believe event frequently occurred likely occur again also take account those instances event occur
hume wise man [
considers side supported greater number experiments [
hundred instances experiments side fifty another afford doubtful expectation any event though hundred uniform experiments contradictory reasonably beget pretty strong degree assurance
cases must balance opposite experiments [
deduct smaller number greater order know exact force superior evidence
hume discusses testimony those report miracles
testimony might doubted even great authority case facts themselves credible
[t]he evidence resulting testimony admits diminution greater less proportion fact less unusual
although hume leaves open possibility miracles occur reported offers various arguments against ever having happened history points out people often lie good reasons lie miracles occurring either because believe doing benefit their religion because fame results
furthermore people nature enjoy relating miracles heard without caring their veracity thus miracles easily transmitted even false
also hume notes miracles seem occur mostly ignorant barbarous nations times reason occur civilised societies such societies awed know natural events
finally miracles each religion argue against other religions their miracles even proportion reported miracles across world fit hume's requirement belief miracles each religion make other less likely
hume extremely pleased argument against miracles enquiry
states flatter myself discovered argument like nature just will wise learned everlasting check kinds superstitious delusion consequently will useful long world endures
thus hume's argument against miracles abstract basis founded upon scrutiny just primarily miracles forms belief systems
common sense notion veracity based upon epistemological evidence founded principle rationality proportionality reasonability
criterion assessing belief system hume based balance probability whether something likely occurred
since weight empirical experience contradicts notion existence miracles such accounts should treated scepticism
further myriad accounts miracles contradict another people receive miracles will aim prove authority jesus whereas others will aim prove authority muhammad other religious prophet deity
these various differing accounts weaken overall evidential power miracles
[not citation given] despite hume observes belief miracles popular gazing populace [
receive greedily without examination whatever soothes superstition promotes wonder
critics argued hume's position assumes character miracles natural laws prior any specific examination miracle claims thus amounts subtle form begging question
assume testimony homogeneous reference group seems unwise- compare private miracles public miracles unintellectual observers intellectual observers those little gain much lose those much gain little lose convincing many
indeed many argued miracles contradict laws nature require laws nature intelligible miraculous thus subverting law nature
example william adams remarks there must ordinary course nature before anything extraordinary
there must stream before anything interrupted
also noted requires appeal inductive inference none observed every part nature nor examined every possible miracle claim instance those future
hume's philosophy especially problematic
little appreciated voluminous literature either foreshadowing hume likes thomas sherlock directly responding engaging hume- william paley william adams john douglas john leland george campbell among others
campbell rumoured having read campbell's dissertation hume remarked scotch theologue beaten
hume's main argument concerning miracles miracles definition singular events differ established laws nature
such natural laws codified result past experiences
therefore miracle violation prior experience thus incapable basis reasonable belief
however probability something occurred contradiction past experience should judged less probability either ones senses deceived person recounting miraculous occurrence lying mistaken
hume say past experience
hume refusal grant credence does guarantee correctness
offers example indian prince having grown up hot country refuses believe water frozen
hume's lights refusal wrong prince reasoned justly presumably extensive experience freezing water warrant believe event occur
hume either miraculous event will become recurrent event else will never rational believe occurred
connection religious belief left unexplained throughout except close discussion hume notes reliance christianity upon testimony miraculous occurrences
makes ironic remark anyone moved faith assent revealed testimony conscious continued miracle own person subverts principles understanding gives determination believe most contrary custom experience
hume writes testimony ever really given any miracle ever will given subject derision
