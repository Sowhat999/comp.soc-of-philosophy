she received education mathematics literature science
her mother gabrielle-anne horrified her progress fought louis-nicolas every step once attempting émilie sent convent
émilie also liked dance passable performer harpsichord sang opera amateur actress
teenager short money books she used her mathematical skills devise highly successful strategies gambling
marriage 12 june 1725 she married marquis florent-claude du chastellet-lomont
[note 1] her marriage conferred title marquise du chastellet
[note 2] like many marriages among nobility theirs arranged

initially she tutored algebra calculus moreau de maupertuis member academy sciences
although mathematics forte maupertuis received solid education johann bernoulli also taught leonhard euler

relationship voltaire frontispiece voltaire's book newton's philosophy du châtelet appears voltaire's muse reflecting newton's heavenly insights down voltaire
du châtelet voltaire may met her childhood her father's salons voltaire himself dates their meeting 1729 returned exile london

there she studied physics mathematics published scientific articles translations
judge voltaire's letters friends their commentaries each other's work lived together great mutual liking respect
literary rather scientific person voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions 1738 elements philosophy newton chapters optics show strong similarities her own essai sur l'optique
she able contribute further campaign laudatory review journal des savants
while sharing passion science scientific collaborations
set up laboratory du châtelet's home
healthy competition both entered 1738 paris academy prize contest nature fire since émilie disagreed voltaire's essay

social life life voltaire emilie de chatelet's relationship voltaire caused her give up most her social life become involved her study mathematics teacher pierre-louis moreau de maupertuis
because her studies first person indroduce ideas isaac newton her
there many letter written during de chatelet explain how she felt during transition life next scientific research publications criticizing locke debate thinking matter her writings émilie du châtelet criticizes john locke’s philosophy
she emphasizes necessity verification knowledge through experience locke’s idea possibility thinking matter […] abstruse
her critique locke originates her bernard de mandeville commentary [on fable bees]
she confronts us her resolute statement favor universal principles precondition human knowledge action maintains kind law innate
[…] du châtelet claims necessity universal presupposition because there no such beginning our knowledge relative
way du châtelet rejects john locke’s aversion innate ideas priori principles
she also reverses locke’s negation principle contradiction constitute basis her methodic reflections institutions
contrary she affirms her arguments favor necessity priori universal principles
“two two then make well 4 6” priori principles exist
pierre louis moreau de maupertuis’ julien offray de mettrie’s reference du châtelet's deliberations motion free will thinking matter numbers way metaphysics indicate importance her reflections
she rebuts claim finding truth using mathematical laws […] argues against maupertuis
heat light dissertation sur nature et propagation du feu 1744 1737 châtelet published paper entitled dissertation sur nature et propagation du feu based upon her research science fire predicted today known infrared radiation nature light
institutions de physique her book institutions de physique “lessons physics” appeared 1740 presented review new ideas science philosophy studied her thirteen-year-old son incorporated sought reconcile complex ideas leading thinkers time

de mairan
dortous de mairan secretary academy sciences published set arguments addressed her regarding appropriate mathematical expression forces vives
du châtelet presented spirited point point rebuttal de mairan's arguments caused withdraw controversy
immanuel kant’s first publication 1747 'gedanken zur wahren schätzung lebendigen kräfte' focuses du châtelet's pamphlet against secretary french academy sciences mairan
beyond also interesting fact kant’s opponent johann augustus eberhard accusing kant having taken ideas du châtelet
advocacy kinetic energy although early 18 th century concepts force momentum long understood idea energy transferable currency different systems still infancy fully resolved until well 19 th century
now accepted total mechanical momentum system conserved none lost friction
simply put there no 'momentum friction' momentum transfer different forms particularly there no potential momentum
emmy noether proved true problems initial state symmetric generalized coordinates
mechanical energy kinetic potential may lost another form total conserved time
châtelet contribution hypothesis conservation total energy distinct momentum
inspired theories gottfried leibniz she repeated publicized experiment originally devised willem 's gravesande balls dropped different heights sheet soft clay
each ball's kinetic energy - indicated quantity material displaced - shown proportional square velocity
deformation clay found directly proportional height balls dropped equal initial potential energy
earlier workers such newton voltaire believed energy far understood concept indistinct momentum therefore proportional velocity
classical physics correct formula kinetic energy object mass speed
energy must same dimensions any form necessary able relate different forms kinetic potential heat…
newton's work assumed exact conservation mechanical momentum
broad range mechanical problems soluble energy conservation included
collision scattering two point masses them
leonhard euler joseph-louis lagrange established formal framework mechanics using results du châtelet
translation commentary newton's principia 1749 year her death she completed work regarded her outstanding achievement her translation french her commentary newton’s principia mathematica including her derivation notion conservation energy principles mechanics
published ten years after her death today du châtelet's translation principia mathematica still standard translation work french
