though also continued tradition aristotle- augustine-focused thought franciscan school through anselm-directed lens
fact alexander major influences advancement anselmian thought 13 th century
such example idea original sin lack justice
alexander believed original sin both punishment well cause punishment
say body corrupt soul clean
alexander advances idea god’s fault create being bind ‘corrupt’ ‘clean’
advanced highly original response soul naturally desires body
consequently god both merciful giving soul wants well just punishing soul binding corrupt flesh
either soul knew body corrupt case “laboring under ignorance” both these considerations cause divine punishment
alexander also known rejecting idea there many things god’s mind instead claiming perfect know just thing
start off view though
glossa openly suggests idea multiplicity divine ideas
later work quaestio disputata antequam erat frater 46 finally rejects plurality divine ideas theme continues through rest works
specifically last works de scientia divina concludes idea plurality itself strictly temporal human notion
