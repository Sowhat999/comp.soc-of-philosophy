francis blackburne 1765 argued john jortin misread other passages luther while gottfried fritschel pointed out 1867 actually refers soul man life homo enim hac vita tired daily labour defatigus diurno labore night enters bedchamber sub noctem intrat cubiculum suum whose sleep interrupted dreams
henry eyster jacobs' english translation 1898 reads nevertheless sleep life future life differ life man fatigued daily labour nightfall goes couch peace sleep there enjoys rest nor does know anything evil whether fire murder

mary's church berlin october 1529 philip landgrave hesse convoked assembly german swiss theologians marburg colloquy establish doctrinal unity emerging protestant states
agreement achieved fourteen points out fifteen exception being nature eucharist sacrament lord's supper—an issue crucial luther
theologians including zwingli melanchthon martin bucer johannes oecolampadius differed significance words spoken jesus last supper my body you cup new covenant my blood corinthians 1123–26
luther insisted real presence body blood christ consecrated bread wine called sacramental union while opponents believed god spiritually symbolically present
zwingli example denied jesus' ability place time luther stressed omnipresence human nature
according transcripts debate sometimes became confrontational
citing jesus' words flesh profiteth nothing john 6
63 zwingli passage breaks your neck
don't too proud luther retorted german necks don't break easily
hesse switzerland
table luther words hoc est corpus meum my body chalk continually indicate firm stance
despite disagreements eucharist marburg colloquy paved way signing 1530 augsburg confession formation schmalkaldic league following year leading protestant nobles such john saxony philip hesse george margrave brandenburg-ansbach
swiss cities however sign these agreements
epistemology scholars asserted luther taught faith reason antithetical sense questions faith illuminated reason
articles our christian faith god revealed us word presence reason sheerly impossible absurd false
[that] reason no way contributes faith
reason greatest enemy faith never comes aid spiritual things
however though seemingly contradictorily also latter work human reason strives against faith enlightened rather furthers advances bringing claims fideist dispute
contemporary lutheran scholarship however found different reality luther
luther rather seeks separate faith reason order honor separate spheres knowledge each applies
bernhard lohse example demonstrated classic work fides und ratio luther ultimately sought put two together
recently hans-peter grosshans demonstrated luther's work biblical criticism stresses need external coherence right exegetical method
means luther important bible reasonable according reality outside scriptures bible makes sense itself internal coherence
right tool understanding world outside bible luther none other reason field science philosophy history empirical observation
here different picture presented luther deeply valued both faith reason held them dialectical partnership
luther's concern thus separating them honoring their different epistemological spheres
judaism further information christianity judaism 1523 luther jesus christ born jew discouraged mistreatment jews advocated their conversion proving old testament shown speak jesus christ
however reformation continued luther began lose hope large-scale jewish conversion christianity
later years luther grew hostile toward jews writing against them kind venom already unleashed anabaptists zwinglianism papacy
1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen jews their lies took place among other anti-jewish literature times although historians acknowledge treatise particularly extreme even standards sixteenth century europe
takes hardline against judaism writing synagogues jewish homes should destroyed their money confiscated liberty curtailed
these statements their influence antisemitism contributed controversial status
islam further information protestantism islam battle turks christians 16 th century time marburg colloquy suleiman magnificent besieging vienna vast ottoman army
luther argued against resisting turks 1518 explanation ninety-five theses provoking accusations defeatism
saw turks scourge sent punish christians god agents biblical apocalypse destroy antichrist whom luther believed papacy roman church
consistently rejected idea holy war though our people army christians against turks enemies christ
absolutely contrary christ's doctrine name
other hand keeping doctrine two kingdoms luther support non-religious war against turks
1526 argued whether soldiers state grace national defence reason just war
1529 war against turk actively urging emperor charles v german people fight secular war against turks
made clear however spiritual war against alien faith separate waged through prayer repentance
around time siege vienna luther prayer national deliverance turks asking god give our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies
1542 luther read latin translation qur'an
went produce several critical pamphlets islam called mohammedanism turk
though luther saw muslim faith tool devil indifferent practice let turk believe live will just lets papacy other false christians live
opposed banning publication qur'an wanting exposed scrutiny
antinomian controversy early 1537 johannes agricola 1494–1566 serving time pastor luther's birthplace eisleben preached sermon claimed god's gospel god's moral law ten commandments revealed god's wrath christians
based sermon others agricola luther suspected agricola behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating wittenberg
these theses asserted law no longer taught christians belonged city hall
luther responded these theses six series theses against agricola antinomians four became basis disputations 1538 1540
also responded these assertions other writings such 1539 open letter c
güttel against antinomians book councils church same year
theses disputations against antinomians luther reviews reaffirms hand called second use law law holy spirit's tool work sorrow over sin man's heart thus preparing christ's fulfillment law offered gospel
luther states everything used work sorrow over sin called law even christ's life christ's death sin god's goodness experienced creation
simply refusing preach ten commandments among christians thereby removing three letters l-a-w church does eliminate accusing law
claiming law any form should preached christians anymore tantamount asserting christians no longer sinners themselves church consists essentially holy people
other hand luther also points out ten commandments considered god's condemning judgment expression eternal will natural law also positively teach how christian ought live
traditionally called third use law
luther also christ's life understood example nothing illustration ten commandments christian should follow her vocations daily basis
ten commandments beginnings renewed life christians accorded them sacrament baptism present foreshadowing believers' future angel-like life heaven midst life
luther's teaching ten commandments therefore clear eschatological overtones characteristically luther encourage world-flight direct christian service neighbor common daily vocations perishing world
bigamy philip hesse december 1539 luther became implicated bigamy philip landgrave hesse wanted marry wife's ladies-in-waiting
philip solicited approval luther melanchthon bucer citing precedent polygamy patriarchs
theologians prepared make general ruling reluctantly advised landgrave determined should marry secretly keep quiet matter
result 4 march 1540 philip married second wife margarethe von saale melanchthon bucer among witnesses
however philip unable keep marriage secret threatened make luther's advice public
luther tell good strong lie deny marriage completely philip during subsequent public controversy
view luther's biographer martin brecht giving confessional advice philip hesse worst mistakes luther made next landgrave himself directly responsible history chiefly holds luther accountable
brecht argues luther's mistake gave private pastoral advice miscalculated political implications
affair caused lasting damage luther's reputation
anti-judaism antisemitism main article martin luther antisemitism see also christianity antisemitism original title page jews their lies written martin luther 1543 luther jews throughout career though few works dealt them directly
luther rarely encountered jews during life attitudes reflected theological cultural tradition saw jews rejected people guilty murder christ lived within local community expelled jews ninety years earlier
considered jews blasphemers liars because rejected divinity jesus whereas christians believed jesus messiah
luther believed human beings set themselves against god equally guilty
early 1516 many people proud marvelous stupidity call jews dogs evildoers whatever like while too equally realize sight god
1523 luther advised kindness toward jews jesus christ born jew also aimed convert them christianity
efforts conversion failed grew increasingly bitter toward them
2010 book bonhoeffer pastor martyr prophet spy christian author eric metaxas claimed luther's attitude towards jews unraveled along health
luther's other major works jews 60000-word treatise von den juden und ihren lügen jews their lies vom schem hamphoras und vom geschlecht christi holy name lineage christ both published 1543 three years before death
luther argued jews no longer chosen people devil's people referred them violent vile language
citing deuteronomy 13 wherein moses commands killing idolaters burning their cities property offering god luther called scharfe barmherzigkeit sharp mercy against jews see whether might save least few glowing flames
luther advocated setting synagogues fire destroying jewish prayerbooks forbidding rabbis preaching seizing jews' property money smashing up their homes these envenomed worms forced labour expelled time
robert michael's view luther's words fault slaying them amounted sanction murder
god's anger them intense luther concluded gentle mercy will tend make them worse while sharp mercy will reform them little
therefore any case away them! luther spoke out against jews saxony brandenburg silesia
josel rosheim jewish spokesman tried help jews saxony 1537 later blamed their plight priest whose name martin luther—may body soul bound up hell!—who issued many heretical books whoever help jews doomed perdition
josel asked city strasbourg forbid sale luther's anti-jewish works refused initially lutheran pastor hochfelden used sermon urge parishioners murder jews
luther's influence persisted after death
throughout 1580 s riots led expulsion jews several german lutheran states
luther most widely read author generation within germany acquired status prophet
according prevailing view among historians anti-jewish rhetoric contributed significantly development antisemitism germany 1930 s 1940 s provided ideal underpinning nazis' attacks jews
reinhold lewin writes anybody against jews whatever reason believed right justify himself triumphantly referring luther
according michael just every anti-jewish book printed third reich contained references quotations luther
heinrich himmler admiringly writings sermons jews 1940

according daniel goldhagen bishop martin sasse leading protestant churchman published compendium luther's writings shortly after kristallnacht diarmaid mac culloch professor history church university oxford argued luther's writing blueprint
sasse applauded burning synagogues coincidence day writing introduction 10 november 1938 luther's birthday synagogues burning germany
german people urged ought heed these words greatest antisemite time warner people against jews
judensau wittenberg church built 1300–1470
heart scholars' debate luther's influence whether anachronistic view work precursor racial antisemitism nazis
scholars see luther's influence limited nazis' use work opportunistic
biographer martin brecht points out there world difference belief salvation racial ideology
nevertheless misguided agitation evil result luther fatefully became 'church fathers' anti-semitism thus provided material modern hatred jews cloaking authority reformer
johannes wallmann argues luther's writings against jews largely ignored 18 th 19 th centuries there no continuity luther's thought nazi ideology
uwe siemon-netto agreed arguing because nazis already anti-semites revived luther's work
hans j
hillerbrand agreed focus luther adopt essentially ahistorical perspective nazi antisemitism ignored other contributory factors german history
similarly roland bainton noted church historian luther biographer wish luther died before ever [on jews their lies] written
position entirely religious no respect racial
other scholars argue even views merely anti-judaic—that opposed judaism adherence rather jews ethnic group—their violence lent new element standard christian suspicion judaism
ronald berger writes luther credited germanizing christian critique judaism establishing anti-semitism key element german culture national identity
paul rose argues caused hysterical demonizing mentality jews enter german thought discourse mentality might otherwise absent
