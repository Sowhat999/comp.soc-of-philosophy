february 2015 case animal rights regan argues non-human animals bear moral rights
philosophy aligns broadly within tradition immanuel kant though rejects kant's idea respect due rational beings
regan points out routinely ascribe inherent value thus right treated respect humans rational including infants severely mentally impaired
crucial attribute humans common argues rationality fact each us life matters us other words happens us matters us regardless whether matters anyone else
regan's terminology each experience being subject-of-a-life
true basis ascribing inherent value individuals consistent must ascribe inherent value hence moral rights subjects-of-a-life whether human non-human
basic right possess inherent value argues right never treated merely means ends others
regan's view used means entails right treated respect includes right harmed
right however absolute there times respect someone’s right harmed another’s right harmed must overridden
philosophy employs principles such miniride principle
minimize overriding worse-off principle deal these situations
miniride principle faced overriding rights many innocent beings versus rights few innocent beings—when each individual involved equally harmed—we should override rights few
worse-off principle states individuals involved harmed comparable way given certain course action should mitigate situation those worse-off
thus harm few innocent beings greater harm many innocent beings right action override rights many
relates animal rights regan asserts harm death animal tantamount harm death normal healthy human
supposedly because ending animal life entails loss fewer opportunities compared loss normal healthy human
note arguably does make regan vulnerable charge speciesism evaluation harm based criterion opportunity mere species membership
according regan there harm death normal healthy dog there death person irreversibly comatose dog opportunities satisfaction irreversibly comatose human
supporters argue regan's argument animal rights does rely radical new theory ethics follows consistent application moral principles insights many us already hold respect ethical treatment human beings
however others criticize lack certainty regan's inherent value subject-of-a-life status determined note sufficient conditions lists—for example having sense-perceptions beliefs desires motives memory—in effect reduce similarity humans
according regan follows ascription animals basic right treated respect should abolish breeding animals food animal experimentation commercial hunting
starting leather-wearing circus-visiting meat eater series musings experiences insights led conclude morally unable use animals meat clothing any other purpose does respect their rights

moore’s view truly scientific ethic able prove very little concerning values rules duty virtues
regarding values such ethic cannot establish anything concerning intrinsic value—what good itself
