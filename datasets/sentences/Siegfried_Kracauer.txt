theories memory siegfried kracauer's theories memory revolved around idea memory under threat being challenged modern forms technology
most often cited example comparison memory photography
reason comparison photography theory replicates tasks currently done memory
differences functions memory functions photography according kracauer photography creates fixed moment time whereas memory itself beholden singular instance
photography capable capturing physicality particular moment removes any depth emotion might otherwise associated memory
essence photography cannot create memory rather create artifact
memory other hand beholden particular moment time nor purposefully created
memories impressions upon person recall due significance event moment
photography also work record time linear way kracauer even hints floods photographs ward off death creating sort permanence
however photography also excludes essence person over time photographs lose meaning become “heap details
isn't say kracauer felt photography no use memory simply felt photography held potential historical memory personal memory
photography allows depth detail advantage collective memory such how city town once appeared because those aspects forgotten overridden throughout time physical landscape area changes
