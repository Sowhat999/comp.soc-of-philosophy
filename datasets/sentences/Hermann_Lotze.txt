lotze published these works medical science still under influence schelling's philosophy nature
mechanical laws external things subject conceived being valid inorganic world
mechanism unalterable connexion every phenomenon other phenomena c either following preceding mechanism inexorable form events world cast connected
object those writings establish all-pervading rule mechanism
mechanical view nature identical materialistic
last above-mentioned works question discussed great length how consider mind relation mind body answer consider mind immaterial principle action however body vice versa purely mechanical indicated fixed laws psycho-physical mechanism
these doctrines lotze though pronounced distinct reiterated reservation contain solution philosophical question regarding nature mechanism nevertheless many considered last word philosopher decisive rejection reveries schelling idealistic theories hegel
published during years modern school german materialism height these works lotze enrolled opposing camp empirical philosophy
misinterpretations suffered induced lotze publish small polemical pamphlet streitschriften 1857 corrected two mistakes
opposition hegel's formalism induced associate materialistic school others count among followers herbart
lotze denied belonged school herbart
admitted though historically same doctrine might considered forerunner herbart's teachings might lead own views viz
monadology leibniz
philosophy lotze worked post-revolutionary time transition idealistic rationalist legacies leibniz kant hegel new materialism scientific interpretation reality
believed everywhere wide realm observation find three distinct regions region facts region laws region standards value
these three regions separate our thoughts reality
full understanding comes through conviction world facts field those higher standards moral aesthetic value being realized through medium laws
such union intelligible through idea personal deity creation preservation world voluntarily chosen certain forms laws through natural operation ends work gained
lectures ranged over wide field delivered annually lectures psychology logic latter including survey entirety philosophical research encyclopädie philosophie then longer intervals lectures metaphysics philosophy nature philosophy art philosophy religion rarely history philosophy ethics
these lectures expounded peculiar views stricter form during last decade life embodied substance those courses system philosophie two volumes appeared vol

third concluding volume treat condensed form principal problems practical philosophy philosophy art religion completed before death
problem purely formal character try bring unity harmony scattered thoughts our general culture
wanted especially investigate those conceptions form initial assumptions conditions several sciences fix limits their applicability
investigations will then naturally divide themselves three parts first deals those our mind inevitable forms laws obliged think things think metaphysics second being devoted great region facts trying apply results metaphysics these specially two great regions external mental phenomena cosmology psychology third dealing those standards value pronounce our aesthetic ethical approval disapproval
goal form general idea how laws facts standards value may combined comprehensive view
world many things surrounds us our notions manage correctly incorrectly describe also ready made
remains done explain how such world manages nor how came form these notions eliminate those abstract notions inconsistent jarring remodel define them may constitute consistent harmonious view
course things their connexion thinkable assumption plurality existences reality distinguished our knowledge them conceived multitude relations
quality standing relation other things gives thing reality
nature reality again neither consistently represented fixed hard substance nor unalterable something fixed order recurrence continually changing events impressions
things themselves exist their changing phases must stand internal connexion themselves must active passive capable doing suffering
why interpret once render intelligible common conception originating natural science viz
system laws governs many things? attempting make conception quite clear thinkable forced represent connexion things universal substance essence conceive system laws underlies everything own self connects everything imperceptible known us merely through impressions produces us call things
practical life well those science equally served deprive material things outside us independence assign them merely connected existence through universal substance action alone appear us
traced material things through our scientific discovery them back culture gave them reality through science ultimately back values established culture
lotze's historical position much interest
though disclaims being follower herbart formal definition philosophy conception object metaphysics similar those herbart defines philosophy attempt remodel notions given experience
endeavor forms herbart opposition philosophies johann gottlieb fichte friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling georg wilhelm friedrich hegel aimed objective absolute knowledge also criticism kant aimed determining validity human knowledge
however idealists object thought alone absolute lotze cannot defined rigorous philosophical language aspirations human heart contents our feelings desires aims art tenets religious faith must grasped order fill empty idea absolute meaning
these manifestations divine spirit again cannot traced understood reducing hegel growth human mind individual society history monotonous rhythm speculative schematism
essence worth them reveals itself student detail reality larger wider philosophy
problem how many solved us numberless examples life experience surround us must retain lifelong interest constitute true field useful human work
conviction emptiness terms abstract notions fullness individual life led lotze combine writings two courses german philosophical thought moving since death great founder leibniz
may define these courses terms esoteric exoteric
former academic quest systematize everything reduce our knowledge intelligible principle
attempt missed deeper meaning leibniz's philosophy
latter unsystematized philosophy general culture find work great writers classical period lessing winckelmann goethe schiller herder
these expressed degree their indebtedness leibniz
lotze brought philosophy out lecture-room market-place life
understanding combining strengths each approach became true successor leibniz
age lotze lived germany appreciate position took up
frequently misunderstood yet rarely criticized nevertheless greatly admired listened devoted hearers read increasing circle
circle never attained unity philosophical school
