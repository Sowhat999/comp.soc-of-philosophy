work today bertalanffy considered founder principal authors interdisciplinary school thought known general systems theory
according weckowicz 1989 occupies important position intellectual history twentieth century
contributions went beyond biology extended cybernetics education history philosophy psychiatry psychology sociology
admirers even believe theory will day provide conceptual framework these disciplines
spending most life semi-obscurity ludwig von bertalanffy may well least known intellectual titan twentieth century
individual growth model individual growth model published ludwig von bertalanffy 1934 widely used biological models exists number permutations
simplest version so-called bertalanffy growth equation expressed differential equation length l over time t bertalanffy growth rate ultimate length individual
model proposed earlier august friedrich robert pūtter 1879-1929 writing 1920
dynamic energy budget theory provides mechanistic explanation model case isomorphs experience constant food availability
inverse bertalanffy growth rate appears depend linearly ultimate length different food levels compared
intercept relates maintenance costs slope rate reserve mobilized use metabolism
ultimate length equals maximum length high food availabilities

general system theory biologist widely recognized contributions science systems theorist specifically development theory known general system theory gst
theory attempted provide alternatives conventional models organization
gst defined new foundations developments generalized theory systems applications numerous areas study emphasizing holism over reductionism organism over mechanism
foundational gst inter-relationships elements together form whole
open systems main article open system systems theory bertalanffy's contribution systems theory best known theory open systems
system theorist argued traditional closed system models based classical science second law thermodynamics inadequate explaining large classes phenomena
bertalanffy maintained “the conventional formulation physics principle inapplicable living organism being open system having steady state
may well suspect many characteristics living systems paradoxical view laws physics consequence fact
however while closed physical systems questioned questions equally remained over whether open physical systems justifiably lead definitive science application open systems view general theory systems
bertalanffy’s model theorist defined general principles open systems limitations conventional models
ascribed applications biology information theory cybernetics
concerning biology examples open systems view suggested “may suffice indicate briefly large fields application” “outlines wider generalization” hypothesis cybernetics
although potential applications exist other areas theorist developed implications biology cybernetics
bertalanffy also noted unsolved problems included continued questions over thermodynamics thus unsubstantiated claim there physical laws support generalizations particularly information theory need further research problems potential applications open system view physics
systems social sciences social sciences bertalanffy believe general systems concepts applicable e
theories introduced field sociology modern systems approach included “the concept general system feedback information communication etc
theorist critiqued classical “atomistic” conceptions social systems ideation “such ‘social physics’ often attempted reductionist spirit
bertalanffy also recognized difficulties application new general theory social science due complexity intersections natural sciences human social systems
however theory still encouraged new developments sociology anthropology economics political science psychology among other areas
[citation needed] today bertalanffy's gst remains bridge interdisciplinary study systems social sciences
