thought democratic theorist democratic theorists advocate discussion within cultures support social change
benhabib democratic theorist does believe purity cultures she thinks them formed through dialogues other cultures
human cultures according benhabib constant change imaginary boundaries
influence each other sometimes radicalize conform reaction other cultures
benhabib argues democratic theory assumed every single person should able determine their own life
she argues pluralism existence fundamentally different cultures compatible cosmopolitanism three conditions fulfilled
these conditions egalitarian reciprocity members minorities must equal civil political economic cultural rights majority
voluntary self-ascription person born should expected she will automatically member particular religion culture
state should let groups define lives individuals
members society right express themselves desirable adult individuals asked whether choose continue membership their community
freedom exit association every individual must able exit their group
group members marry someone another group right member
accommodations must found inter-group marriages resulting children
contested whether cultural diversity democratic equality co-exist
many cultures compatible three given conditions
example first condition violated within several cultures such kurds turkey roma eastern europe
every nation state groups accepted majority
governments nothing stop discrimination against minorities
second third condition also problematic
thus present there seems no examples states practicing perfect version benhabib's system mixing pluralism cosmopolitanism
does course rule out possible nor societal goal worth striving
porous borders benhabib prefers world porous borders
she argues political boundaries define members lock others out
she written think possible empire without borders don’t think possible democracy without borders
[citation needed] people live countries their own state sovereignty strong past
benhabib argues somebody stateless seen outcast way rightless
current policy still sees national borders means keep out strangers
benhabib's cosmopolitan view inspired german philosopher immanuel kant
kant’s perpetual peace concerns three articles together key creating perpetual peace
third article kant says rights world citizens shall limited right universal hospitality
kant's view every single person right go wherever like without fear hostility their hosts
benhabib takes right starting point resulted her thoughts migration refugee problems
benhabib goes further kant arguing human right hospitality should apply single visit cases long-term stays
example country shouldn't send refugee back sure whether safe country origin
nations should obligations exiles refugees these obligations different obligations immigrants
