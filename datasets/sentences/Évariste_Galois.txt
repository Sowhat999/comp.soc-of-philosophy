father republican head bourg-la-reine's liberal party
father became mayor village after louis xviii returned throne 1814
mother daughter jurist fluent reader latin classical literature responsible her son's education first twelve years
age 10 galois offered place college reims mother preferred keep home
october 1823 entered lycée louis-le-grand despite turmoil school beginning term hundred students expelled galois managed perform well first two years obtaining first prize latin
soon became bored studies age 14 began take serious interest mathematics
found copy adrien marie legendre's éléments de géométrie read like novel mastered first reading
15 reading original papers joseph louis lagrange such landmark réflexions sur résolution algébrique des équations likely motivated later work equation theory leçons sur le calcul des fonctions work intended professional mathematicians yet classwork remained uninspired teachers accused affecting ambition originality negative way
budding mathematician 1828 attempted entrance examination école polytechnique most prestigious institution mathematics france time without usual preparation mathematics failed lack explanations oral examination
same year entered école normale then known l'école préparatoire far inferior institution mathematical studies time found professors sympathetic
following year galois' first paper continued fractions published
around same time began making fundamental discoveries theory polynomial equations
submitted two papers topic academy sciences
augustin louis cauchy refereed these papers refused accept them publication reasons still remain unclear
however spite many claims contrary widely held cauchy recognized importance galois' work merely suggested combining two papers order enter competition academy's grand prize mathematics
cauchy eminent mathematician time though political views opposite end galois' considered galois' work likely winner
28 july 1829 galois' father committed suicide after bitter political dispute village priest
couple days later galois made second last attempt enter polytechnique failed yet again
undisputed galois qualified however accounts differ why failed
plausible accounts state galois made too many logical leaps baffled incompetent examiner enraged galois
recent death father may also influenced behavior
having denied admission polytechnique galois took baccalaureate examinations order enter école normale
passed receiving degree 29 december 1829
examiner mathematics reported pupil sometimes obscure expressing ideas intelligent shows remarkable spirit research
submitted memoir equation theory several times never published lifetime due various events
noted before first attempt refused cauchy february 1830 following cauchy's suggestion submitted academy's secretary joseph fourier considered grand prix academy
unfortunately fourier died soon after memoir lost
prize awarded year niels henrik abel posthumously also carl gustav jacob jacobi
despite lost memoir galois published three papers year laid foundations galois theory
second numerical resolution equations root finding modern terminology
third important number theory concept finite field first articulated
political firebrand galois lived during time political turmoil france
charles x succeeded louis xviii 1824 1827 party suffered major electoral setback 1830 opposition liberal party became majority
charles faced abdication staged coup d'état issued notorious july ordinances touching off july revolution ended louis-philippe becoming king
while their counterparts polytechnique making history streets during les trois glorieuses galois other students école normale locked school's director
galois incensed blistering letter criticizing director submitted gazette des écoles signing letter full name
although gazette's editor omitted signature publication galois expelled
although expulsion formally taken effect 4 january 1831 galois quit school immediately joined staunchly republican artillery unit national guard
divided time mathematical work political affiliations
due controversy surrounding unit soon after galois became member 31 december 1830 artillery national guard disbanded out fear might destabilize government
around same time nineteen officers galois' former unit arrested charged conspiracy overthrow government
april 1831 officers acquitted charges 9 may 1831 banquet held their honor many illustrious people present such alexandre dumas
proceedings grew riotous galois proposed toast king louis philippe dagger above cup interpreted threat against king's life
arrested following day acquitted 15 june 1831
following bastille day 14 july 1831 galois head protest wearing uniform disbanded artillery came heavily armed several pistols rifle dagger
again arrested
23 october sentenced six months prison illegally wearing uniform
released 29 april 1832
during imprisonment continued developing mathematical ideas
final days galois memorial cemetery bourg-la-reine
évariste galois buried common grave exact location still unknown
galois returned mathematics after expulsion école normale although continued spend time political activities
after expulsion became official january 1831 attempted start private class advanced algebra attracted interest waned seemed political activism priority
siméon poisson asked submit work theory equations 17 january 1831
around 4 july 1831 poisson declared galois' work incomprehensible declaring [galois'] argument neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed allow us judge rigor however rejection report ends encouraging note then suggest author should publish whole work order form definitive opinion
while poisson's report made before galois' july 14 arrest took until october reach galois prison
unsurprising light character situation time galois reacted violently rejection letter decided abandon publishing papers through academy instead publish them privately through friend auguste chevalier
apparently however galois ignore poisson's advice began collecting mathematical manuscripts while still prison continued polishing ideas until release 29 april 1832
galois' fatal duel took place 30 may
true motives behind duel obscure
there much speculation reasons behind
known five days before death letter chevalier clearly alludes broken love affair
archival investigation original letters suggests woman romantic interest mademoiselle stéphanie-félicie poterin du motel daughter physician hostel galois stayed during last months life
fragments letters her copied galois himself many portions either obliterated such her name deliberately omitted available
letters hint mlle
du motel confided her troubles galois might prompted provoke duel himself her behalf
conjecture also supported other letters galois later friends night before died
much detailed speculation based these scant historical details interpolated many galois' biographers most notably eric temple bell men mathematics such frequently repeated speculation entire incident stage-managed police royalist factions eliminate political enemy
opponent duel alexandre dumas names pescheux d'herbinville du motel's fiancé nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal celebrated banquet occasioned galois' first arrest
[citation needed] however dumas alone assertion extant newspaper clippings few days after duel give description opponent accurately applies galois' republican friends most probably ernest duchatelet imprisoned galois same charges
given conflicting information available true identity killer may well lost history
whatever reasons behind duel galois convinced impending death stayed up night writing letters republican friends composing become mathematical testament famous letter auguste chevalier outlining ideas three attached manuscripts
mathematician hermann weyl testament letter judged novelty profundity ideas contains perhaps most substantial piece writing whole literature mankind
however legend galois pouring mathematical thoughts onto paper night before died seems exaggerated
these final papers outlined rough edges work doing analysis annotated copy manuscript submitted academy other papers
early morning 30 may 1832 shot abdomen died after refusing offices priest following morning ten o'clock cochin hospital probably peritonitis
there plans initiate uprising during funeral during same time frame leaders heard general jean maximilien lamarque's death funeral postponed without any uprising occurring
galois' younger brother notified events prior galois' death
20 years old
last words younger brother alfred “ne pleure pas alfred ! j'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à vingt ans !”don't cry alfred! need my courage die twenty
2 june évariste galois buried common grave montparnasse cemetery whose exact location unknown
cemetery native town bourg-la-reine cenotaph honour erected beside graves relatives
galois' mathematical contributions published full 1843 liouville reviewed manuscript declared sound
finally published october–november 1846 issue journal de mathématiques pures et appliquées
most famous contribution manuscript novel proof there no quintic formula fifth higher degree equations generally solvable radicals
although abel already proved impossibility quintic formula radicals 1824 ruffini published solution 1799 turned out flawed galois' methods led deeper research now called galois theory
example use determine any polynomial equation whether solution radicals
contributions mathematics closing lines letter galois friend auguste chevalier dated may 29 1832 two days before galois' death tu prieras publiquement jacobi ou gauss de donner leur avis non sur vérité mais sur l'importance des théorèmes
après cela il aura j'espère des gens qui trouveront leur profit à déchiffrer tout ce gâchis
ask jacobi gauss publicly give their opinion truth importance these theorems
later there will hope people will find their advantage decipher mess
within 60 pages galois' collected works many important ideas far-reaching consequences nearly branches mathematics
work compared niels henrik abel another mathematician died very young age much their work significant overlap
algebra while many mathematicians before galois gave consideration now known groups galois first use word group french groupe sense close technical sense understood today making among founders branch algebra known group theory
developed concept today known normal subgroup
called decomposition group left right cosets proper decomposition left right cosets coincide today known normal subgroup
also introduced concept finite field also known galois field honor essentially same form understood today
last letter chevalier attached manuscripts second three made basic studies linear groups over finite fields constructed general linear group over prime field glν p computed order studying galois group general equation degree pν
constructed projective special linear group psl2 p
galois constructed them fractional linear transforms observed simple except p 2 3
these second family finite simple groups after alternating groups
noted exceptional fact psl2 p simple acts p points p 5 7
