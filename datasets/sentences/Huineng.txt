huineng born lu family 638
xinzhou present-day xinxing county guangdong province
father died young family poor
consequence huineng no opportunity learn read write remained illiterate entire life
platform sutra platform sūtra sixth patriarch attributed huineng
constructed over longer period time contains different layers writing
wonderful melange early chan teachings virtual repository entire tradition up second half eighth century
heart sermon same understanding buddha-nature seen texts attributed bodhidharma hongren including idea fundamental buddha-nature made invisible ordinary humans their illusions
citation buddhist scriptures platform sūtra cites explains wide range buddhist scriptures listed here order appearance diamond sutra laṅkāvatāra sūtra mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra mahāprajñāpāramitā sūtra brahmajāla sūtra vimalakirti sutra lotus sutra śūraṅgama sūtra[citation needed] awakening faith mahayana[citation needed] diamond sutra according platform sutra day while delivering firewood store huineng heard customer reciting diamond sutra awakening
immediately inquired sutra decided seek out fifth patriarch daman hongren monastery huang mei mountain
later versions story customer giving 10 100 taels silver provide aged mother
after travelling thirty days foot arrived huangmei mountain fifth patriarch presiding
introduction hongren first chapter ming canon version platform sutra describes introduction huineng hongren follows patriarch asked me you you seek? replied your disciple commoner xinzhou lingnan
travelled far pay homage you seek nothing other buddhahood
you're lingnan barbarian! how you expect become buddha? asked patriarch
replied although people exist northerners southerners buddha-nature there neither north nor south
barbarian differs your holiness physically difference there our buddha-nature?[citation needed] huineng became labourer monastery doing chores rice mill chopping wood pounding rice monastery next eight months
succession hongren platform sutra contains well-known story contest succession hongren
according text huineng won contest flee monastery avoid rage supporters shenxiu
story factual account th-century construction probably so-called oxhead school
becoming sixth patriarch sixth patriarch cutting bamboo liang kai 梁楷 c
1140-1210 first chapter platform sutra tells well-known apocryphal story dharma-transmission hongren hui-neng
hongren asked students
write me stanza gatha [
understands essence mind will given robe insignia patriarchate dharma ultimate teaching chan school shall make sixth patriarch
shenxiu poem anonymously wall middle night
stated 身是菩提樹， body bodhi tree 心如明鏡臺。 mind standing mirror bright
時時勤拂拭， times polish diligently 勿使惹塵埃。 let no dust alight
[citation needed] after having read poem aloud hui-neng asked officer write another gatha wall next shenxiu's stated 菩提本無樹， bodhi originally without any tree 明鏡亦非臺。 bright mirror also stand
本來無一物， originally there single thing — 何處惹塵埃。 any dust attracted?[citation needed] nanhua temple huineng taught lived
hongren read stanza received huineng abode expounded diamond sutra
came passage use mind yet free any attachment huineng came great awakening
exclaimed how amazing self nature originally pure! how amazing self nature unborn undying! how amazing self nature inherently complete! how amazing self nature neither moves nor stays! how amazing dharmas come self nature![citation needed] hongren then passed robe begging bowl symbols dharma seal enlightenment huineng thus became sixth patriach
interpretation verses according traditional interpretation based guifeng zongmi fifth-generation successor shenhui two verses represent respectively gradual sudden approach
according mc rae incorrect understanding [t]he verse attributed shenxiu does fact refer gradual progressive endeavor constant practice cleaning mirror [
[h]is basic message constant perfect teaching endless personal manifestation bodhisattva ideal
huineng's verse does stand alone forms pair shenxiu's verse huineng's verses apply rhetoric emptiness undercut substantiality terms formulation
however basic meaning first proposition still remains
mc rae notes similarity reasoning oxhead school used threefold structure absolute relative middle thesis-antithesis-synthesis
according mc rae platform sutra itself synthesis threefold structure giving balance need constant practice insight absolute
teachings sudden enlightenment doctrinally southern school associated teaching enlightenment sudden while northern school associated teaching enlightenment gradual
polemical exaggeration since both schools derived same tradition so-called southern school incorporated many teachings influential northern school
eventually both schools died out influence shenhui immense later chan schools traced their origin huineng sudden enlightenment became standard doctrine chan
no-thought meditation according tradition huineng taught no-thought pure unattached mind comes goes freely functions fluently without any hindrance
alleged northern schools emphasis quiet contemplation criticised huineng alive keeps sitting without lying down
dead lies without sitting up
both cases set stinking bones! great lesson life?[a] historical impact according modern historiography huineng marginal obscure historical figure
modern scholarship questioned hagiography
historic research reveals story created around middle th century beginning 731 shenhui successor huineng win influence imperial court
claimed huineng successor hongren instead then publicly recognized successor shenxiu through propaganda shen-hui 684-758 huineng
710 became also today still towering figure sixth patriarch ch’an/zen buddhism accepted ancestor founder subsequent ch’an lineages
using life confucius template structure shen-hui invented hagiography then highly obscure huineng
same time shen-hui forged lineage patriarchs ch’an back buddha using ideas indian buddhism chinese ancestor worship
745 shenhui invited take up residence heze temple luoyang
753 fell out grace leave capital go exile
most prominent successors lineage guifeng zongmi according zongmi shenhui's approach officially sanctioned 796 imperial commission determined southern line ch'an represented orthodox transmission established shen-hui seventh patriarch placing inscription effect shen-lung temple
