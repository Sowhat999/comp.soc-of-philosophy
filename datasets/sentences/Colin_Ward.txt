based upon principle ward put small face-to-face groups bureaucratising hierarchical tendencies inherent organisations least opportunity develop
[citation needed] particularly admired swiss system direct democracy cantons whereby each canton run members control laws placed upon them although disapproved many policies system enacted
believe social ideas anarchism autonomous groups spontaneous order workers’ control federative principle add up coherent theory social organisation valid realistic alternative authoritarian hierarchical institutional social philosophy see application around us
