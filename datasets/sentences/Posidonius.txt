along other greek intellectuals posidonius favored rome stabilizing power turbulent world
connections roman ruling class politically important sensible also important scientific research
entry government provided posidonius powerful connections facilitate travels far away places even beyond roman control
after established himself rhodes posidonius made journeys traveling throughout roman world even beyond boundaries conduct scientific research
traveled greece hispania italy sicily dalmatia gaul liguria north africa eastern shores adriatic
hispania atlantic coast gades modern cadiz posidonius observe tides much higher native mediterranean
daily tides related moon's orbit while tidal heights vary cycles moon hypothesized yearly tidal cycles synchronized equinoxes solstices
gaul studied celts
left vivid descriptions things saw own eyes while among them men paid allow their throats slit public amusement nailing skulls trophies doorways
noted celts honored druids whom posidonius saw philosophers concluded even among barbaric pride passion give way wisdom ares stands awe muses
geographic treatise lands celts since lost referred extensively both directly otherwise works diodorus sicily strabo caesar tacitus' germania
school posidonius's extensive writings lectures gave authority scholar made famous everywhere graeco-roman world school grew around rhodes
grandson jason son daughter menekrates nysa followed footsteps continued posidonius's school rhodes
although little known organization school clear posidonius steady stream greek roman students
partial scope writings posidonius celebrated polymath throughout graeco-roman world because came near mastering knowledge time similar aristotle eratosthenes
attempted create unified system understanding human intellect universe provide explanation guide human behavior
posidonius physics including meteorology physical geography astronomy astrology divination seismology geology mineralogy hydrology botany ethics logic mathematics history natural history anthropology tactics
studies major investigations their subjects although without errors
wilhelm capelle de neue jahrbücher 1905 traced most doctrines de mundo poseidonius popular philosophic treatise based two works poseidonius
none works survive intact
found fragments although titles subjects many books known
philosophy posidonius philosophy dominant master art individual sciences subordinate philosophy alone explain cosmos
works scientific historical inseparably philosophical
accepted stoic categorization philosophy physics natural philosophy including metaphysics theology logic including dialectic ethics
these three categories stoic fashion inseparable interdependent parts organic natural whole
compared them living being physics meat blood logic bones tendons holding organism together finally ethics most important part corresponding soul
philosophical grand vision universe itself similarly interconnected organism through cosmic sympathy respects development physical world history humanity
although firm stoic posidonius like panaetius other stoics middle period eclectic
followed older stoics also plato aristotle
although certain posidonius may written commentary plato's timaeus
first stoic depart orthodox doctrine passions faulty judgments posit plato's view soul correct namely passions inherent human nature
addition rational faculties posidonius taught human soul faculties spirited anger desires power possessions etc
desiderative desires sex food
ethics problem how deal these passions restore reason dominant faculty
physics physics posidonius advocated theory cosmic sympathy συμπάθεια sumpatheia organic interrelation appearances world sky earth part rational design uniting humanity things universe even those temporally spatially separate
although teacher panaetius doubted divination posidonius used platonic philosophy support belief divination — whether through astrology prophetic dreams — kind scientific prediction
astronomy fragments writings astronomy survive through treatise cleomedes circular motions celestial bodies first chapter second book appearing mostly copied posidonius
posidonius advanced theory sun emanated vital force permeated world
attempted measure distance size sun
90 bce posidonius estimated distance sun see astronomical unit 9893 times earth's radius still too small half
measuring size sun however reached figure larger accurate those proposed other greek astronomers aristarchus samos
posidonius also calculated size distance moon
posidonius constructed orrery possibly similar antikythera mechanism
posidonius's orrery according cicero exhibited diurnal motions sun moon five known planets
geography ethnology geology world map according ideas posidonius 150-130 bce drawn 1628 cartographers petrus bertius melchior tavernier
many details known posidonius rather bertius tavernier show posidonius's ideas positions continents
posidonius’s fame beyond specialized philosophical circles begun latest eighties publication work ocean adjacent areas
work overall representation geographical questions according current scientific knowledge served popularize theories internal connections world show how forces effect each other how interconnectedness applied also human life political just personal spheres
work posidonius detailed theory effect people’s character climate included representation geography races
theory solely scientific also political implications—his roman readers informed climatic central position italy essential condition roman destiny dominate world
stoic however make fundamental distinction civilized romans masters world less civilized peoples
posidonius calculated earth's circumference reference position star canopus
explained cleomedes posidonius observed canopus never above horizon rhodes while alexandria saw ascend far 7½ degrees above horizon meridian arc latitude two locales actually 5 degrees 14 minutes
since thought rhodes 5000 stadia due north alexandria difference star's elevation indicated distance two locales 1/48 th circle multiplied 5000 48 arrive figure 240000 stadia circumference earth
translating stadia modern units distance problematic generally thought stadium used posidonius almost exactly 1/10 modern statute mile
thus posidonius's measure 240000 stadia translates 24000 miles much short actual circumference 24901 miles
posidonius's method calculating circumference earth relied altitude star canopus posidonius informed approach finding earth's circumference eratosthenes century earlier used elevation sun different latitudes arrive figure 250000 stadia result rounded 252000 divisible 60
both men's figures earth's circumference uncannily accurate aided part each case mutually compensating errors measurement
strabo noted distance rhodes alexandria 3750 stadia reported posidonius's estimate earth's circumference 180000 stadia 18000 miles
pliny elder mentions posidonius among sources without naming reported method estimating earth's circumference
noted however hipparchus added 26000 stadia eratosthenes's estimate
smaller value offered strabo different lengths greek roman stadia created persistent confusion around posidonius's result
ptolemy used posidonius's lower value 180000 stades 33% too low earth's circumference geography
number used christopher columbus order underestimate distance india 70000 stades
like pytheas posidonius believed tide caused moon
posidonius however wrong cause
thinking moon mixture air fire attributed cause tides heat moon hot enough cause water swell hot enough evaporate
recorded observations both earthquakes volcanoes including accounts eruptions volcanoes aeolian islands north sicily
meteorology posidonius writings meteorology followed aristotle
theorized causes clouds mist wind rain well frost hail lightning rainbows
also estimated boundary clouds heavens lies 40 stadia above earth
mathematics posidonius first attempt prove euclid's fifth postulate geometry
suggested changing definition parallel straight lines equivalent statement allow prove fifth postulate
there euclidean geometry restructured placing fifth postulate among theorems instead
addition writings geometry posidonius credited creating mathematical definitions articulating views technical terms example 'theorem' 'problem'
history tactics histories posidonius continued world history polybius
history period 146 88 bce filled 52 volumes
histories continue account rise expansion roman dominance appears supported
posidonius follow polybius's detached factual style posidonius saw events caused human psychology while understood human passions follies pardon excuse them historical writing using narrative skill fact enlist readers' approval condemnation
posidonius history extended beyond earth sky humanity isolated each own political history part cosmos
histories therefore concerned isolated political history peoples individuals included discussions forces factors geographical factors mineral resources climate nutrition let humans act part their environment
example posidonius considered climate arabia life-giving strength sun tides taken book oceans climatic theory explain people’s ethnic national characters
posidonius's work tactics art war greek historian arrian complained written 'for experts' suggests posidonius may first hand experience military leadership perhaps utilized knowledge gained acquaintance pompey
jews posidonius's writings jews probably source diodorus siculus's account siege jerusalem possibly also strabo's
posidonius's arguments contested josephus against apion
reputation influence posidonius depicted medieval scholar nuremberg chronicle own era writings almost principal divisions philosophy made posidonius renowned international figure throughout graeco-roman world widely cited writers era including cicero livy plutarch strabo called posidonius most learned philosophers my time cleomedes seneca younger diodorus siculus used posidonius source bibliotheca historia [historical library] others
although ornate rhetorical style writing passed out fashion soon after death posidonius acclaimed during life literary ability stylist
posidonius major source materials celts gaul profusely quoted timagenes julius caesar sicilian greek diodorus siculus greek geographer strabo
posidonius appears moved ease among upper echelons roman society ambassador rhodes
associated leading figures late republican rome including cicero pompey both whom visited rhodes
twenties cicero attended lectures 77 bce continued correspond
cicero de finibus closely followed posidonius's presentation panaetius's ethical teachings
posidonius met pompey rhodes's ambassador rome pompey visited rhodes twice once 66 bce during campaign against pirates again 62 bce during eastern campaigns asked posidonius write biography
gesture respect great honor pompey lowered fasces before posidonius's door
other romans visited posidonius rhodes velleius cotta lucilius
ptolemy impressed sophistication posidonius's methods included correcting refraction light passing through denser air near horizon
ptolemy's approval posidonius's result rather eratosthenes's earlier correct figure caused become accepted value earth's circumference next 1500 years
posidonius fortified stoicism middle period contemporary learning
next teacher panaetius most writings personal contacts spread stoicism roman world
century later seneca referred posidonius those made largest contribution philosophy
influence philosophical thinking lasted until middle ages shown citation suda massive medieval lexicon
time scholars perceived posidonius's influence almost every subsequent writer whether warranted
today posidonius seems recognized having inquiring wide-ranging mind entirely original breadth view connected accordance underlying stoic philosophy things their causes knowledge overarching unified world view
