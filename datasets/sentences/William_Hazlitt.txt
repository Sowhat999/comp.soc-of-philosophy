trouble brewing however
hazlitt attacked brutally quarterly review blackwood's magazine both tory publications
blackwood's article mocked pimpled hazlitt accused ignorance dishonesty obscenity incorporated vague physical threats
though hazlitt rattled these attacks sought legal advice sued
lawsuit against blackwood's finally settled out court favour
yet attacks entirely cease
quarterly review issued review hazlitt's published lectures condemned ignorant writing unintelligible
such partisan onslaughts brought spirited responses
unlike earlier response blackwood's attack never saw light day published letter william gifford esq
1819 gifford editor quarterly
pamphlet notable also deploying term ultracrepidarian hazlitt himself may coined amounts apologia life work thus far showed well able defend himself
yet hazlitt's attackers done their damage
personally shaken found difficult works published once struggle living
solitude infatuation lecturing particular drawn hazlitt small group admirers
best known today poet john keats attended lectures became friends hazlitt period

those few years before poet's untimely death two read admired each other's work keats younger man seeking guidance solicited hazlitt's advice course reading direction career
keats's writing particularly key idea negative capability influenced concept disinterested sympathy discovered hazlitt whose work poet devoured
hazlitt part later younger generation poets keats showed most promise became keats's first anthologist included several keats's poems collection british poetry compiled 1824 three years after keats's death
less well known today keats others loyally attended lectures constituted small circle admirers such diarist chronicler henry crabb robinson novelist mary russell mitford
rumours spread demonising hazlitt along vilifications tory press hurt pride seriously obstructed ability earn living
income lectures also proved insufficient keep afloat
thoughts drifted gloom misanthropy
mood improved fact now there no pretence keeping up appearances marriage failed
years earlier grown resigned lack love sarah
visiting prostitutes displayed idealised amorous inclinations toward number women whose names lost history
now 1819 unable pay rent their rooms 19 york street family evicted
last straw sarah moved rooms their son broke hazlitt good forcing find own accommodation
sometimes see son even wife whom remained speaking terms effectively separated

thus days end shut himself away write periodicals including recently reestablished 1820 london magazine contributed drama criticism miscellaneous essays
roman road toward middle winterslow route hazlitt preferred take village idea particularly bore fruit series articles called table-talk
many written expressly inclusion book same name table-talk original essays appeared different editions forms over next few years
these essays structured loose manner table talk written familiar style sort devised two centuries earlier montaigne whom hazlitt greatly admired
personal now substituted editorial careful remodulation style carried spirit these essays far typical eighteenth-century periodical essay closely adhered round table
preface later edition table-talk hazlitt explained these essays eschewed scholarly precision favour combination literary conversational

hazlitt also spend time london these years
another violent contrast london lodging house stage worst crisis life play itself out
august 1820 month after father's death 83 rented couple rooms 9 southampton buildings london tailor named micaiah walker
walker's 19-year-old daughter sarah helped housekeeping bring new lodger breakfast
immediately hazlitt became infatuated miss walker years junior
brief conversations walker cheered alleviated loneliness felt failed marriage recent death father
dreamed marrying her require divorce sarah hazlitt—no easy matter
finally wife agreed grant scottish divorce allow remarry divorced england
sarah walker hazlitt's friends see fairly ordinary girl
she aspirations better herself famous author seemed like prize catch she never really understood hazlitt
another lodger named tomkins came along she entered romantic entanglement well leading each her suitors believe sole object her affection
vague words she evaded absolute commitment until she decide she liked better advantageous catch
hazlitt discovered truth tomkins then jealousy suspicions sarah walker's real character afforded little rest
months during preparations divorce tried earn living alternated rage despair hand comforting unrealistic thought she really good girl accept last
divorce finalised 17 july 1822 hazlitt returned london see beloved—only find her cold resistant
then become involved angry altercations jealousy recrimination
over though hazlitt time persuade himself believe
mind nearly snapped
emotional nadir contemplated suicide
difficulty eventually recovered equilibrium
order ascertain sarah's true character persuaded acquaintance take lodgings walkers' building attempt seduce sarah
hazlitt's friend reported attempt seemed succeed she prevented taking ultimate liberty
her behaviour several other male lodgers hazlitt now concluded dealing rather angel impudent whore ordinary lodging house decoy
eventually though hazlitt know she child tomkins moved
pouring out tale woe anyone happened meet including friends peter george patmore james sheridan knowles able find cathartic outlet misery
catharsis also provided recording course love thinly disguised fictional account published anonymously may 1823 liber amoris new pygmalion
enough clues present identity writer remain hidden long
critics divided literary merits liber amoris deeply personal account frustrated love quite unlike anything else hazlitt ever
wardle suggests compelling marred sickly sentimentality also proposes hazlitt might even anticipating experiments chronology made later novelists
two positive reviews appeared such globe 7 june 1823 liber amoris unique english language possibly first book fervour vehemency careless exposure passion weakness—of sentiments sensations common race mankind seek most studiously mystify conceal—that exhibits portion most distinguishing characteristics rousseau ought generally praised
however such complimentary assessments rare exception
whatever ultimate merits liber amoris provided ample ammunition hazlitt's detractors even closest friends scandalised
months even contact lambs
strait-laced robinson found book disgusting nauseous revolting low gross tedious very offensive believing ought exclude author decent society
ever peace mind proved elusive william hazlitt
philosopher again unsurprisingly there times turbulent period hazlitt focus work

other essays bring perspective scope limitations mind measured against vastness universe extent human history why distant objects please [1821/2] antiquity two many
several others scrutinise manners morals age such vulgarity affectation patronage puffing corporate bodies [all 1821]

essay never appeared table-talk series anywhere else author's lifetime
direct personal account prize fight commingling refined literary allusions popular slang controversial time depicting too low subject
written dismal time life—hazlitt's divorce pending far sure being able marry sarah walker—the article shows scarcely trace agony
quite like any other essay hazlitt proved most popular frequently reprinted after death nearly two centuries later judged most passionately written pieces prose late romantic period
another article written period pleasure hating 1823 included plain speaker level pure outpouring spleen distillation bitterness life point

twentieth-century critic gregory dart sees hazlitt's self-diagnosis own misanthropic enmities sour surreptitiously preserved offspring jacobinism
hazlitt concludes diatribe refocusing himself

table-talk essays frequently display trenchant insights human nature times reflect vehicle those insights literary art criticism constitute essays

these essays quite like anything ever done before
attracted admiration during hazlitt's lifetime long after death their reputation achieved full stature increasingly often considered among best essays ever written english
nearly two centuries after written example biographer stanley jones deemed hazlitt's table-talk plain speaker together constitute major work life critic david bromwich called many these essays observing original keen-witted any others language
1823 hazlitt also published anonymously characteristics manner rochefoucault's maxims collection aphorisms modelled explicitly hazlitt noted preface maximes 1665–1693 duc de rochefoucauld
never quite cynical rochefoucauld's many however reflect attitude disillusionment stage life
primarily these 434 maxims took extreme method arguing paradoxes acute contrasts
example maxim ccccxxviii there persons never succeed being too indolent undertake anything others regularly fail because instant find success their power grow indifferent give over attempt
also lacked benefit hazlitt's extended reasoning lucid imagery never included among greatest works
recovery second marriage beginning 1824 though worn out thwarted passion venomous attacks character following liber amoris hazlitt beginning recover equilibrium

she may attracted idea marrying well-known author
hazlitt she offered escape loneliness extent financial worries she possessed independent income £300 per annum
arrangement seems strong element convenience both them
certainly hazlitt nowhere writings suggests marriage love match seeking nor does mention new wife
fact after three half years tensions likely resulting stanley jones put hazlitt's improvidence son's dislike her neglect wife due obsessive absorption preparing immense biography napoleon resulted her abrupt departure never lived together again

betraying their earlier liberal principles both coleridge southey sworn brothers same cause righteous apostacy
now again harshness softened focus shifts coleridge's positive attributes
most learned brilliant men age coleridge may greatest writer—but most impressive talker
even apostacy somewhat excused noting recent times genius stopped way legitimacy
crushed regrettably understandably leading many former liberals protect themselves siding powers
southey whose political about-face blatant others still comes measure biting criticism truth self-opinion ruling principle mr
southey's mind

hazlitt contrasts scott byron skewers nemesis gifford praises—not without usual strictures—jeffrey goes portray way another such notables mackintosh brougham canning wilberforce
praise poet thomas campbell cited major instance hazlitt's critical judgement proved wrong
hazlitt scarcely conceal enthusiasm such poems gertrude wyoming neither poems nor hazlitt's judgement them withstood test time

european tour september 1824 hazlitt wife began tour european continent crossing english channel steamboat brighton dieppe proceeding there coach sometimes foot paris lyon crossing alps savoy then continuing through italy florence rome most southerly point their route
crossing apennines travelled venice verona milan then switzerland vevey geneva
finally returned via germany netherlands belgium france again arriving dover england 16 october 1825
there two extended stops excursion paris hazlitts remained three months vevey switzerland rented space farmhouse three months
during those lengthy pauses hazlitt accomplished writing tasks primarily submitting account trip several instalments morning chronicle helped pay trip
these articles later collected published book form 1826 notes journey through france italy despite title there also much other countries visited particularly switzerland
escape time conflicts bitter reactions outspoken criticisms attacks own publications back england
despite interludes illness well miseries coach travel dishonesty hotel keepers coach drivers hazlitt managed enjoy himself
reacted sight paris like child entering fairyland approach capital side st

remained wife paris three months eagerly exploring museums attending theatres wandering streets mingling people
especially glad able return louvre revisit masterpieces adored twenty years ago recording readers renewed impressions canvases guido poussin titian among others
also pleased meet befriend henri beyle now better known nom de plume stendhal discovered much like hazlitt's writings hazlitt
finally wife resumed journey italy
advanced slowly those days pre-railway travel stage taking nearly week cover less two hundred miles hazlitt registered running commentary scenic points interest
road florence rome example towards close first day's journey
splendid view country travel lay stretched out beneath our feet immense distance descended little town pozzo borgo
deep valleys sloped each side us smoke cottages occasionally curled branches overhanging birch-tree neighbouring ruin gave relief grey misty landscape streaked dark pine-forests speckled passing clouds extreme distance rose range hills glittering evening sun scarcely distinguishable ridge clouds hovered near them
hazlitt words ralph wardle never stopped observing comparing
unabashed sightseer wanted take everything available recreate vividly saw
yet frequently showed himself mere sightseer painter critic philosopher asserting their influence turn once
splendid scene shore lake geneva example viewed eye both painter art critic inspired following observation lake shone like broad golden mirror reflecting thousand dyes fleecy purple clouds while saint gingolph clustering habitations shewed like dark pitchy spot side beyond glimmering verge jura
hovered gay wreaths clouds fair lovely visionary seemed world
no person describe effect claude's landscapes evening clouds drink up rosy light sink soft repose! likewise philosopher hazlitt emerges account following morning pleasant walk next morning along side lake under grey cliffs green hills azure sky
snowy ridges seemed close us vevey receding farther kind lofty background advanced
speculation bishop berkeley other philosopher distance measured motion sight verified here every step
also constantly considering manners people differences english french later lesser extent italians swiss

found culture widespread among working classes you see apple-girl paris sitting stall her feet over stove coldest weather defended sun umbrella reading racine voltaire
trying honest himself every day discovering something new french manners confounded preconceptions hazlitt soon compelled retract old prejudices
judging nations will deal mere abstractions concluded
countries well individuals there mixture good bad qualities yet attempt strike general balance compare rules exceptions
befriended stendhal paris florence besides visiting picture galleries became friends walter savage landor
also spent much time old friend leigh hunt now residence there
hazlitt ambivalent rome farthest point journey
first impression disappointment
expected primarily monuments antiquity
asked green-grocer's stall stupid english china warehouse putrid trattoria barber's sign old clothes old picture shop gothic palace
ancient rome? further picture galleries rome disappointed me quite
eventually found plenty admire accumulation monuments art place almost too much there also too many distractions

equal even greater importance paintings

way home crossing swiss alps hazlitt particularly desired see town vevey scene rousseau's 1761 novel nouvelle héloïse love story associated disappointed love sarah walker

grey skies bad food compared unfavorably recent retreat suffering digestive problems these recurred throughout much later life though also good home
already plans return paris
old age artists comfortable hazlitt settling again home down street london late 1825 remained until mid-1827 reality earning living again stared face
continued provide stream contributions various periodicals primarily new monthly magazine
topics continued favourites including critiques new school reformers drama criticism reflections manners tendencies human mind
gathered previously published essays collection plain speaker writing few new ones process
also oversaw publication book form account recent continental tour
most wanted write biography napoleon
now sir walter scott writing own life napoleon strictly conservative point view hazlitt wanted produce countervailing liberal perspective
really stance napoleon own idolised napoleon decades prepared return paris undertake research
first however brought fruition another favourite idea
fascinated artists their old age see old age artists hazlitt especially interested painter james northcote student later biographer sir joshua reynolds royal academician
hazlitt frequently visit him—by then 80 years old—and conversed endlessly men manners illustrious figures northcote's younger days particularly reynolds arts particularly painting
northcote time crochety slovenly old man lived wretched surroundings known misanthropic personality
hazlitt oblivious surroundings tolerated crotchetiness
finding congeniality northcote's company feeling many their views alignment transcribed their conversations memory published them series articles entitled boswell redivivus new monthly magazine
later collected under title conversations james northcote esq
there little common these articles boswell's life johnson
hazlitt felt such closeness old artist conversations northcote transformed kind alter ego
hazlitt made no secret fact words ascribed northcote northcote's own sometimes expressed views hazlitt much hazlitt's own words
conversations little gossip spoke their contemporaries without restraint
conversations published those contemporaries outraged
northcote denied words hazlitt shielded consequences degree residing paris work thought masterpiece
last conversation originally published atlas 15 november 1829 hazlitt less year live especially telling
whether really occurred less given construct hazlitt's own imagination provides perspective hazlitt's own position life time
words attributed northcote you two faults feud quarrel world makes you despair prevents you taking pains you might other carelessness mismanagement makes you throw away little you actually brings you difficulties way
hazlitt justifies own contrary attitude length found fault nothing doing one's best apt give world their revenge
former part my life treated cipher since got notice set upon wild beast
case you expect little justice candour you naturally self-defence take refuge sort misanthropy cynical contempt mankind
yet reflection hazlitt felt life bad after man business fortune
up city eight swallows breakfast haste attends meeting creditors must read lloyd's lists consult price consols study markets look accounts pay workmen superintend clerks hardly minute day himself perhaps four-and-twenty hours does single thing help
surely sacrifice time inclination requires compensation meets
how am entitled make my fortune cannot done without anxiety drudgery hardly any thing never any thing like do? rise please breakfast length write comes my head after taking mutton-chop dish strong tea go play thus my time passes
perhaps overly self-disparaging self-portrait opens window kind life hazlitt leading time how evaluated contrast lives overtly successful contemporaries
hero worship august 1826 hazlitt wife set out paris again research hoped masterpiece biography napoleon seeking counteract prejudiced interpretations scott's biography
hazlitt long convinced napoleon greatest man era apostle freedom born leader men old heroic mould thrilled triumphs over 'legitimacy' suffered real anguish downfall
work out quite planned
wife's independent income allowed them take lodgings fashionable part paris comfortable also distracted visitors far libraries needed visit
nor access materials scott's stature connections provided own life napoleon
hazlitt's son also spent time them there conflicts father also drove wedge hazlitt second wife marriage now deteriorating rapidly
none books selling well thus time also spent churning out articles pay expenses
despite distractions few essays written time proved among finest such feeling immortality youth published monthly magazine confused similarly named new monthly magazine march 1827
essay sun-dial appeared late 1827 may written interpolated second tour italy wife son
finally after hazlitt returned london son august 1827 shocked discover wife still paris leaving
settled modest lodgings half-moon street london then fought continual battle against poverty regularly forced grind out stream articles mostly undistinguished just pay expenses
relatively little known hazlitt's other activities period
spent much time apparently winterslow london
meditative essays emerged stay favourite country retreat also made progress life napoleon
also found himself struggling against bouts illness nearly dying winterslow december 1827
two volumes—the first half—of napoleon biography appeared 1828 publisher fail soon thereafter
meant even financial difficulties author little evidence activities time apart stream hastily written articles turned out pay bills consists large part begging letters publishers advances money
easy life spoken northcote largely vanished time conversation published year before death
then overwhelmed degradation poverty frequent bouts physical well mental illness—depression caused failure find true love inability bring fruition defence man worshipped hero liberty fighter despotism
although hazlitt retained few devoted admirers reputation among general public destroyed cadre reviewers tory periodicals whose efforts hazlitt excoriated jealousy spleen party
according john wilson blackwood's magazine example hazlitt already excommunicated decent society nobody touch dead book any body man died plague
dark period marked stream short articles weekly magazines like atlas written generate desperately needed cash
nor time kind life napoleon itself
however much hazlitt hoped masterpiece merely financial failure
although four volumes represent longest work work eventually demonstrated hodge-podge mostly borrowed materials poorly integrated fifth consisting hazlitt's own words
here there few inspired passages stand out such following nowhere any thing may written declared myself republican nor should think worth while martyr confessor any form mode government
staked health wealth name fame upon am ready again last gasp there power people change government governors
hazitt managed complete life napoleon buonaparte shortly before death live see published entirety
last years plaque bouverie street london marking site william hazlitt's house

few details remain hazlitt's daily life last years
much time spent choice bucolic setting winterslow
needed london business reasons
there seems exchanged visits old friends few details these occasions recorded
often seen company son son's fiancée
otherwise continued produce stream articles make ends meet
1828 hazlitt found work reviewing theatre again examiner
playgoing found greatest consolations
most notable essays free admission arose experience
explained there attending theatre merely great solace itself atmosphere conducive contemplating past just memories plays themselves reviewing past performances course whole life
words written within last few months possessor free admission theatre ensconced favourite niche looking 'loop-holes retreat' second circle
views pageant world played before melts down years moments sees human life like gaudy shadow glance across stage here tastes earth's bliss sweet without bitter honey without sting plucks ambrosial fruits amaranthine flowers placed enchantress fancy within reach without having pay tax time repenting afterwards
found time return earlier philosophical pursuits including popularised presentations thoughts expressed earlier writings
these such meditations common sense originality ideal envy prejudice appeared atlas early 1830
