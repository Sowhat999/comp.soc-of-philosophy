strange situation details topic see strange situation
1965 ainsworth wittig designed strange situation procedure way assessing individual differences attachment behaviour evoking individual's reaction encountering stress
strange situation procedure divided eight episodes lasting three minutes each
first episode infant her caregiver enter pleasant laboratory setting many toys
after minute person unknown infant enters room slowly tries make acquaintance
caregiver leaves child stranger three minutes then returns
caregiver departs second time leaving child alone three minutes then stranger enters offers comfort infant
finally caregiver returns instructed pick up child
episodes increase stress infant increments observer watch infant’s movement behavioural systems interplay exploration attachment behaviour presence absence parent
basis their behaviors children ainsworth's original baltimore study placed three classifications
each these groups reflects different kind attachment relationship caregiver implies different forms communication emotion regulation ways responding perceived threats
anxious-avoidant insecure attachment child anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid ignore caregiver - showing little emotion caregiver departs returns
child will explore very much regardless there
there much emotional range regardless room empty
infants classified anxious-avoidant represented puzzle early 1970 s
exhibit distress separation either ignored caregiver their return a1 subtype showed tendency approach together tendency ignore turn away caregiver a2 subtype
ainsworth bell 1970 theorised apparently unruffled behaviour avoidant infants fact mask distress hypothesis later evidenced through studies heart-rate avoidant infants
secure attachment child who's securely attached mother will explore freely while caregiver present using her 'safe base' explore
child will engage stranger caregiver present will visibly upset caregiver departs happy see caregiver her return

anxious-resistant insecure attachment children classified anxious-ambivalent/resistant c showed distress even before separation clingy difficult comfort caregiver’s return
either showed signs resentment response absence c1 subtype signs helpless passivity c2 subtype
ainsworth’s original sample six c infants showed much distress course episodes strange situation procedure ‘that observations discontinued
’ percent infants responded high degree passivity inactivity situation helpless settings
disorganized/disoriented attachment fourth category added ainsworth's colleague mary main
1990 ainsworth put print her blessing new ‘d’ classification though she urged addition regarded ‘open-ended sense subcategories may distinguished’ she worried classification might too encompassing might subsume too many different forms behaviour contrast infants other categories classified mary ainsworth possess standard path reaction while dealing stress separation reunion type infants appeared possess no symptom coping mechanism
fact these infants mixed features such strong proximity seeking followed strong avoidance appeared dazed disoriented upon reunion their caretakers both
