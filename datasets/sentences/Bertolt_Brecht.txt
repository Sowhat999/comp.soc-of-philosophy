willett observes brecht same montage technique spread drama old procrustean plot yielded epic form narrative better able cope wide-ranging modern socio-economic themes
least how brecht theoretically justified choice form 1929 began interpret penchant contradictions much eisenstein terms dialectic

brooker writes term 'alienation' inadequate even misleading translation brecht's verfremdung
