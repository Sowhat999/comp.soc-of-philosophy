1869 1870 bakunin became involved russian revolutionary sergey nechayev number clandestine projects
however bakunin broke nechaev over described latter's jesuit methods means justified achieve revolutionary ends
1870 bakunin led failed uprising lyon principles later exemplified paris commune calling general uprising response collapse french government during franco-prussian war seeking transform imperialist conflict social revolution

bakunin's disagreements marx led attempt marx party expel hague congress see below illustrated growing divergence anti-authoritarian sections international advocated direct revolutionary action organization workers peasants order abolish state capitalism sections allied marx advocated conquest political power working class
bakunin marx’s flamboyant chief opponent presciently warned against emergence communist authoritarianism take power over working people
bakunin's maxim anti-authoritarian majority included most sections international created their own first international st
imier congress adopted revolutionary anarchist program repudiated hague resolutions rescinding bakunin's alleged expulsion although bakunin accepted elements marx’s class analysis theories regarding capitalism acknowledging marx’s genius thought marx's analysis one-sided marx's methods compromise social revolution
importantly bakunin criticized authoritarian socialism associated marxism concept dictatorship proletariat adamantly refused
you took most ardent revolutionary vested absolute power within year worse tsar himself
bakunin retired lugano 1873 died bern july 1876
thought bakunin's political beliefs rejected statist hierarchical systems power every name shape idea god downwards every form hierarchical authority whether emanating will sovereign even state allowed universal suffrage
dieu et l'état god state liberty man consists solely obeys laws nature because himself recognized them such because imposed upon externally any foreign will whatsoever human divine collective individual
bakunin similarly rejected notion any privileged position class since social economic inequality implied class systems well systems national gender oppression incompatible individual freedom
whereas liberalism insisted free markets constitutional governments enabled individual freedom bakunin insisted both capitalism state any form incompatible individual freedom working class peasantry
peculiarity privilege every privileged position kill intellect heart man
privileged man whether privileged politically economically man depraved intellect heart
bakunin's political beliefs based several interrelated concepts liberty 2 socialism 3 federalism 4 anti-theism 5 materialism
also developed resultantly prescient critique marxism predicting marxists successful seizing power create party dictatorship dangerous because appears sham expression people's will
authority freethought bakunin thought does follow reject authority? far me such thought
matter boots refer authority bootmaker concerning houses canals railroads consult architect engineer
such such special knowledge apply such such savant
allow neither bootmaker nor architect nor savant impose authority upon me
listen them freely respect merited their intelligence their character their knowledge reserving my incontestable right criticism censure
content myself consulting single authority any special branch consult several compare their opinions choose seems me soundest
recognise no infallible authority even special questions consequently whatever respect may honesty sincerity such such individual no absolute faith any person
saw therefore there no fixed constant authority continual exchange mutual temporary above voluntary authority subordination
same reason forbids me then recognise fixed constant universal authority because there no universal man no man capable grasping wealth detail without application science life impossible sciences branches social life

bakunin first give struggle against theology complete consistency absolute naturalism
therefore there nothing negative evil except theological doctrine god sin stamps man villain order provide pretext domination hunger power
bakunin thought religion originated human ability abstract thinking fantasizing
according bakunin religion sustained indoctrination conformism
another factor survival religion existence poverty suffering exploitation real life religion promises salvation afterlife
oppressors take advantage religion according bakunin because many religious people reconcile themselves injustice earth promise happiness heaven
bakunin argues oppressors receive authority religion
religious people many cases obedient priests because many religious people believe statements priests based direct divine revelation scripture
obedience divine revelation scripture considered ethical criteria many religious people because god considered omniscient omnipotent omnibenevolent being
therefore each statement considered derived infallible god cannot criticized humans
according religious way thinking humans cannot know themselves just god decides good wrong
people disobey “messengers god” threatened punishment hell
according bakunin alternative religious power monopoly acknowledgement humans equally inspired god means multiple contradictory teachings assigned infallible god logically impossible
therefore bakunin considers religion necessarily authoritarian
bakunin argued book god state idea god implies abdication human reason justice most decisive negation human liberty necessarily ends enslavement mankind theory practice
consequently bakunin reversed voltaire's famous aphorism god exist necessary invent writing instead god really existed necessary abolish
bakunin early proponent term political theology 1871 text political theology mazzini international schmitt's book response
political theology branch both political philosophy theology investigates ways theological concepts ways thinking underlie political social economic cultural discourses
class struggle strategy social revolution bakunin’s methods realizing revolutionary program consistent principles
working class peasantry organize below through local structures interlinked federalist basis creating ideas also facts future itself
their movements prefigure future their ideas practices creating building blocks new society
approach exemplified syndicalism anarchist strategy championed bakunin according trade unions provide both means defend improve workers' conditions rights incomes present basis social revolution based upon workplace occupations
syndicalist unions organize occupations well provide radically democratic structures through workplaces self-managed larger economy coordinated
thus bakunin workers' unions take possession tools production well buildings capital
bakunin reduce revolution syndicalist unions however stressing need organize working-class neighborhoods well unemployed
meanwhile peasants take land throw out those landlords live labor others
bakunin dismiss skilled workers sometimes claimed indeed watchmakers jura region central st
imier international's creation operations
however time unions largely ignored unskilled bakunin placed great emphasis need organize well amongst rabble great masses poor exploited so-called lumpenproletariat inaugurate bring triumph social revolution

removal natural individual differences equality social rights every individual birth particular equal means subsistence support education opportunity every child boy girl until maturity equal resources facilities adulthood create own well-being own labor
collectivist anarchism advocates abolition both state private ownership means production
instead envisions means production being owned collectively controlled managed producers themselves
collectivization means production originally envisaged workers will revolt forcibly collectivize means production
once collectivization takes place money abolished replaced labour notes workers' salaries determined democratic organizations based job difficulty amount time contributed production
these salaries used purchase goods communal market
critique marxism dispute mikhail bakunin karl marx highlighted differences anarchism marxism
strongly rejected marx's concept dictatorship proletariat concept vanguardist socialism including marxist–leninism use justify one-party rule above party 'representing' proletariat
bakunin insisted revolutions must led people directly while any enlightened elite must exert influence remaining invisible
imposed anyone
[and] deprived official rights significance
held state should immediately abolished because forms government eventually lead oppression
libertarian marxists argue marx used phrase mean worker control point production party still state until society reorganized according socialist principles
[the marxists] maintain dictatorship—their dictatorship course—can create will people while our answer no dictatorship any other aim self-perpetuation beget slavery people tolerating freedom created freedom universal rebellion part people free organization toiling masses bottom up
— mikhail bakunin statism anarchism while both social anarchists marxists share same final goal creation free egalitarian society without social classes government strongly disagree how achieve goal
anarchists believe classless stateless society should established direct action masses culminating social revolution refuse any intermediate stage such dictatorship proletariat basis such dictatorship will become self-perpetuating fundament
bakunin fundamental contradiction marxists anarchism freedom aim while state dictatorship means order free masses first enslaved
however bakunin also meeting marx 1844 far learning concerned marx still incomparably advanced
knew nothing time political economy yet rid myself my metaphysical observations
called me sentimental idealist right called vain man perfidious crafty also right
bakunin found marx's economic analysis very useful began job translating das kapital russian
turn marx rebels dresden insurrection 1848 russian refugee michael bakunin found capable cool headed leader
marx engels meeting bakunin 1864 after escape siberia saying whole few people whom find retrogressed after 16 years developed further
bakunin sometimes called first theorist new class meaning 'class' intellectuals bureaucrats running state name people proletariat reality their own interests alone
bakunin argued state patrimony privileged class priestly class aristocratic class bourgeois class
finally other classes exhausted themselves state then becomes patrimony bureaucratic class then falls—or you will rises—to position machine
federalism federalism bakunin meant organization society base summit—from circumference center—according principles free association federation
consequently society organized basis absolute freedom individuals productive associations communes every individual every association every commune every region every nation having absolute right self-determination associate associate ally themselves whomever wish
liberty liberty bakunin mean abstract ideal concrete reality based equal liberty others
positive sense liberty consists fullest development faculties powers every human being education scientific training material prosperity
such conception liberty eminently social because realized society isolation
negative sense liberty revolt individual against divine collective individual authority
materialism bakunin denied religious concepts supernatural sphere advocated 'materialist' explanation natural phenomena manifestations organic life chemical properties reactions electricity light warmth natural attraction physical bodies constitute our view many different no less closely interdependent variants totality real beings call matter selected writings page 219
mission science observation general relations passing real facts establish general laws inherent development phenomena physical social world
however materialism different marx stressed importance non-economic factors human affairs including ideas cultures
revolutionary potential proletariat vs lumpenproletariat peasantry bakunin different view compared marx's revolutionary potential lumpenproletariat proletariat
such both agreed proletariat play key role marx proletariat exclusive leading revolutionary agent while bakunin entertained possibility peasants even lumpenproletariat unemployed common criminals etc
rise occasion
bakunin considers workers' integration capital destructive primary revolutionary forces
bakunin revolutionary archetype found peasant milieu presented having longstanding insurrectionary traditions well communist archetype current social form—the peasant commune amongst educated unemployed youth assorted marginals classes brigands robbers impoverished masses those margins society escaped excluded yet subsumed discipline emerging industrial work
short those whom marx sought include category lumpenproletariat
influence bakunin remembered major figure history anarchism opponent marxism especially marx's idea dictatorship proletariat predictions marxist regimes one-party dictatorships over proletariat proletariat itself
god state translated multiple times other anarchists such benjamin tucker marie le compte emma goldman continues influence modern-day anarchists such noam chomsky
bakunin biographer mark leier asserted bakunin significant influence later thinkers ranging peter kropotkin enrico malatesta wobblies spanish anarchists civil war herbert marcuse e
thompson neil postman
neill down anarchists gathered these days under banner 'anti-globalization
short bakunin major influence labour peasant leftwing movements although overshadowed 1920 s rise marxist regimes
collapse those regimes growing awareness how closely those regimes corresponded dictatorships bakunin predicted bakunin's ideas rapidly gained ground amongst activists cases again overshadowing marxism
criticism violence revolution invisible dictatorship main article invisible dictatorship bakunin accused being closet authoritarian marxists leninists other authoritarian leftists
letter albert richard [t]here power dictatorship whose organisation salutary feasible collective invisible dictatorship those allied name our principle
madison claimed [bakunin] rejected political action means abolishing state developed doctrine revolutionary conspiracy under autocratic leadership– disregarding conflict principle philosophy anarchism
madison contended bakunin's scheming control first international brought rivalry karl marx expulsion 1872
approval violence weapon against agents oppression led nihilism russia individual acts terrorism elsewhere– result anarchism became generally synonymous assassination chaos
however bakunin's supporters argue invisible dictatorship dictatorship any conventional sense word bakunin careful point out members exercise any official political power sense leninist vanguard
their influence ideological freely accepted dictatorship will salutary effective being dressed up any official power extrinsic character
bakunin also criticized marx delegates international specifically because methods organization similar those sergey nechayev whom bakunin closely associated
while bakunin rebuked nechayev upon discovery duplicity well amoral politics retain streak ruthlessness indicated june 2 1870 letter lies cunning [and] entanglement [are] necessary marvelous means demoralising destroying enemy though certainly useful means obtaining attracting new friends nevertheless bakunin began warning friends nechayev's behavior broke off relations nechayev
others note moreover bakunin never sought take personal control international secret organisations subject autocratic power condemned terrorism counter-revolutionary
robert m
cutler goes further pointing out impossible fully understand either bakunin's participation league peace freedom international alliance socialist democracy idea secret revolutionary organisation immanent people without seeing derive interpretation hegel's dialectic 1840 s
script bakunin's dialectic cutler argues gave alliance purpose providing international real revolutionary organisation
marx's advocacy participation bourgeois politics including parliamentary suffrage proof [his being compromising negative language 1842 reaction germany article]
bakunin's duty following script defined dialectic bring [international working-men's association] recognition true role
[bakunin's] desire merge first league then alliance international derived conviction revolutionaries international should never cease penetrated every extremity spirit revolution
just bakunin's dialectic consistent negatives needed compromisers order vanquish them thereby realize negative's true essence bakunin 1860 s needed international order transform activity uncompromising revolution
antisemitism pieces bakunin espouses blatantly antisemitic views severely criticized part writing least anarchists
bakunin used anti-jewish sentiments suggested jewish system global exploitation whole jewish world comprising single exploiting sect kind blood sucking people kind organic destructive collective parasite going beyond frontiers states political opinion world now least most part disposal marx hand rothschild other
may seem strange
there common socialism leading bank? point authoritarian socialism marxist communism demands strong centralisation state
there centralisation state there must necessarily central bank such bank exists parasitic jewish nation speculating labour people will found
however antisemitism central bakunin's work stressed proletarian internationalism class analysis society
[citation needed] significantly jews play large prominent role anarchist movement among them emma goldman alexander berkman voline
early nationalism pre-anarchist years bakunin's politics essentially left-wing form nationalism specifically focus east europe russian affairs
while bakunin time located national liberation democratic struggles slavs larger european revolutionary process pay much attention other regions
aspect thought dates before became anarchist anarchist works consistently envisaged global social revolution including both africa asia
bakunin anarchist continued stress importance national liberation now insisted issue solved part social revolution
same problem view dogged marxist revolutionary strategy capture revolution small elite then oppress masses also arise independence struggles led nationalism unless working class peasantry created anarchy feel myself patriot oppressed fatherlands
historic local fact like real harmless facts right claim general acceptance
every people like every person involuntarily therefore right itself
nationality principle legitimate fact just individuality
every nationality great small incontestable right itself live according own nature
right simply corollary general principal freedom
