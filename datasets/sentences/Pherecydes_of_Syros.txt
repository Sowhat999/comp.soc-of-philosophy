aristotle metaphysics pherecydes being part mythological writer plutarch parallel lives instead being theologian
considered greater significance teaching subject metempsychosis
writings extant hellenistic period although fragments survived present day
works written prose rather verse first communicated conveyed philosophical musings form
tradition maintains pherecydes lived two caves northern part island syros

cosmogony pherecydes’ cave
sources say pherecydes' book entitled pentemychos πεντέμυχος pentemuchos translated five πέντε recesses μυχός muchos nook cranny recess also sanctuary small domestic altar corner
sources titled heptamychos seven ἑπτά recesses
there seems no complete agreement among scholars sources trust regarding title pherecydes' book standard survey reference presocratic philosophers kirk raven schofield opts heptamychos
author modern scholarly book devoted entirely pherecydes hermann s
schibli argues pentemychos true title
work pherecydes taught philosophy through medium mythic representations
although lost fragments survive enough reconstruct basic outline
older cosmogony hesiod th–7 th century bc initial state universe chaos dark void considered divine primordial condition creation ex nihilo out nothing
pherecydes probably interpreted chaos water does place very beginning
cosmogony there three divine principles zas ζάς zeus cthonie χθονίη earth chronos χρόνος time existed
semen seeds chronos probably considered watery chaos placed recesses composed numerous other offsprings gods
described fragment preserved damascius' first principles
close relationship thought exist these recesses chthonie
hesiod described tartaros being recess muchos broad-wayed earth
hermann s
schibli thinks five muchos actually harboured within chthonie least initially chronos disposed seed five nooks
alongside chthonie chronos pherecydes held power called zas
zas zeus comparable orphic eros function such personification masculine sexual creativity
proclus pherecydes used say zeus changed eros create reason having created world opposites led agreement peace sowed sameness things unity interpenetrates universe
act creation itself perhaps accurate say chronos creates zas orders distributes described mytho-poetically zas making cloth decorates earth sea then presents wedding gift chthonie wraps around her
yet another fragment chthonie winged oak wraps cloth around
winged oak cosmology no precedent greek tradition
stories different mutually exclusive because much lacking fragments seems clear creation hindered chaotic forces
pherecydes depicted medieval scholar nuremberg chronicle bust syros before world ordered cosmic battle takes place kronos ordered time head side ophioneus leader other
same story elsewhere enacted zeus typhon/typhoeus leading characters also close parallels many myths cultures other greek marduk vs
tiamat etc
ophioneus brood often depicted ruling birthing cosmos time before falling power
chaotic forces eternal cannot destroyed instead thrown out ordered world locked away tartaros kind appointment spheres victor zeus-kronos takes possession sky space time
locks tartaros fashioned iron zeus might hence associated element aither bronze poseidon might indicate link water often conceived first matter
judging ancient fragments ophioneus thrown okeanos tartaros
exactly entities forces locked away pherecydes’ story cannot known sure
there may five principal figures
ophioneus typhon same eurynome fought side ophioneus against kronos
chthonie principal thing underworld whether she counted five five sum-total open question
apart these known ophioneus-typhon mated echidna echidna herself somehow mysteriously produced callirhoe
pherecydes counted five principal entities association pentemychos doctrine then ophioneus eurynome echidna calirrhoe chthonie main contenders
kronos zeus popularly known version orders offspring out cosmos tartaros
there kept behind locked gates fashioned iron associated zeus element sky/space bronze poseidon—the water force
chaotic beings put pentemychos darkness offspring cast recesses tartaros
no surviving fragment makes connection possible prison-house tartaros pentemychos ways referring essentially same thing
according celsus pherecydes below portion portion tartaros daughters boreas [the north wind] harpies thuella [storm] guard there zeus banished any gods whenever behaves insolence
thus identity zeus' prison-house pentemychos seems likely
influence pherecydes' pentemychos thought contained mystical esoteric teaching treated allegorically
ancient commentator also pherecydes man syros talks recesses pits caves doors gates through these speaks riddles becomings deceases souls
comparatively large number sources say pherecydes first teach eternality transmigration metempsychosis human souls
both cicero augustine thought having given first teaching immortality soul
surprising considered pherecydes teacher pythagoras
first teach such thing doubtful thathe among first profess teaching certain
hermann s
schibli concludes pherecydes included book [pentemychos] least rudimentary treatment immortality soul wanderings underworld reasons soul’s incarnations
pherecydes occasionally counted among seven sages greece
sun-dial heliotropion supposedly made pherecydes diogenes laërtius preserved island syros
reconstruction basing himself extant fragments pherecydes' work testimonia ancient authors regarding pherecydes' philosophy well themes ancient greek near eastern mythologies hermann s
schibli offers following reconstruction main elements pherecydes' lost book chronos zas also chthonie ζὰς μὲν καὶ χρόνος ἦσαν ἀεὶ καὶ χθονίη
once chronos alone without partner cast forth seed
seed made fire air water deposited these five hollows
lo mixtures fire air water hollows arose another generation gods
fiery gods dwelt ouranos gleaming aither gods wind gusty tartaros watery gods chaos gods darkness dwelt black night
after generation gods born seed time assumed their habitations zas became eros married chthonie
other gods built many large palaces provided necessary goods banquet tables servants maids needful things accomplished performed wedding
third day wedding zas fashioned big beautiful robe embroidered earth ogenos mansions ogenos
finished task presented robe chthonie 'because wish marry you honour you robe
rejoice my consort!' say first feast unveiling hence arose custom both gods men
she responded she received robe 'i take my honour henceforth shall called ge
gods celebrated feasting ambrosia
earth like winged oak strong mighty roots extended depths tartaros trunk encircled ogenos branches reached ouranos
earth flourished zas rejoiced
below earth hollow tartaros ophioneus born
monstrous sons challenged kronos
battle-lines drawn up kronos commander army ophioneus leading ophionidai
terms battle stated whichever them fell ogenos defeated while those thrust them out defeated them possess ouranos
fierce conflict followed
kronos strong ally zas single combat overthrew ophioneus
ophioneus brood cast ogenos dwell mansions ogenos day
kronos commander victorious army crowned other gods arose custom wearing crowns victors
zeus honoured victorious gods assigned them their domains
kronos won ouranos
these shares other gods below ouranos fiery aither below aither portion earth below portion tartaros daughters boreas harpies thuella guard there zeus banishes any gods behave insolence
there also souls men committed bloodshed
their souls borne through portals gates tartaros outflowing river birth river like seed leads new life
souls men depart life enter again caves hollows tartaros through portals gates
