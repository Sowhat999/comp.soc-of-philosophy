bohm advanced view quantum physics meant old cartesian model reality there two kinds substance mental physical somehow interact too limited
complement therefore developed mathematical physical theory implicate explicate order
also believed working brain cellular level obeyed mathematics quantum effects postulated thought distributed non-localised way quantum entities readily fit our conventional model space time
[not citation given] bohm warned dangers rampant reason technology advocating instead need genuine supportive dialogue claimed broaden unify conflicting troublesome divisions social world
epistemology mirrored ontological viewpoint
due youthful communist affiliations bohm subject federal government investigation 1949 prompting leave united states
pursued scientific career several countries becoming first brazilian then british citizen
main concern understanding nature reality general consciousness particular coherent whole according bohm never static complete rather unending process movement unfoldment

raised mainly father furniture-store owner assistant local rabbi
despite being raised jewish family became agnostic teenage years
bohm attended pennsylvania state college now pennsylvania state university graduating 1939 then california institute technology year
then transferred theoretical physics group directed robert oppenheimer university california berkeley obtained doctorate
bohm lived same neighborhood oppenheimer's other graduate students giovanni rossi lomanitz joseph weinberg max friedman them became increasingly involved physics radical politics
bohm became active communist communist-backed organizations including young communist league campus committee fight conscription committee peace mobilization
work doctorate manhattan project contributions during world war ii manhattan project mobilized much berkeley's physics research effort produce first atomic bomb
though oppenheimer asked bohm work los alamos top-secret laboratory established 1942 design atom bomb director manhattan project general leslie groves approve bohm's security clearance after seeing evidence politics bohm's friend joseph weinberg also suspected espionage
bohm remained berkeley teaching physics until completed ph
1943 unusual circumstance
according peat see reference below p
64 scattering calculations collisions protons deuterons completed proved useful manhattan project immediately classified
without security clearance bohm denied access own work barred defending thesis even allowed write own thesis first place! satisfy university oppenheimer certified bohm successfully completed research
later performed theoretical calculations calutrons y-12 facility oak ridge used electromagnetically enrich uranium use bomb dropped hiroshima 1945
mc carthyism leaving united states after war bohm became assistant professor princeton university worked closely albert einstein
may 1949 house un-american activities committee called upon bohm testify before because previous ties suspected communists
bohm however pleaded fifth amendment right refuse testify refused give evidence against colleagues
1950 bohm charged refusing answer questions committee arrested
acquitted may 1951 princeton university already suspended
after acquittal bohm's colleagues sought re-instated princeton einstein reportedly wanted bohm serve assistant
university renew contract
request go manchester found support einstein unsuccessful
bohm then left brazil assume professorship physics university são paulo invitation jayme tiomno recommendation einstein oppenheimer
quantum theory bohm-diffusion main articles bohm diffusion de broglie–bohm theory bohmian trajectories electron going through two-slit experiment
similar pattern also observed single photons
during early period bohm made number significant contributions physics particularly quantum mechanics relativity theory
post-graduate berkeley developed theory plasmas discovering electron phenomenon known now bohm-diffusion
first book quantum theory published 1951 well received einstein among others
however bohm became dissatisfied orthodox interpretation quantum theory written book
starting realization wkb approximation quantum mechanics leads deterministic equations convinced mere approximation turn probabilistic theory deterministic theory doubted inevitability conventional approach quantum mechanics
bohm's aim set out deterministic mechanical viewpoint rather show possible attribute properties underlying reality contrast conventional approach
began develop own interpretation de broglie–bohm theory predictions agreed perfectly non-deterministic quantum theory
initially referred approach hidden variable theory later referred ontological theory reflecting view stochastic process underlie phenomena described theory might day found
bohm colleague basil hiley later stated found their own choice terms interpretation terms hidden variables too restrictive particular their variables position momentum actually hidden
bohm's work epr argument became major factor motivating john bell's inequality rules out local hidden variable theories full consequences bell's work still being investigated
brazil after arrival brazil october 10 1951 u
consul são paulo confiscated passport informing retrieve return country
reportedly frightened bohm significantly lowered spirits hoped travel europe
applied received brazilian citizenship due then-brazilian law give up u
citizenship able reclaim decades later 1986 after pursuing lawsuit
university são paulo bohm worked causal theory became object publications 1952
jean-pierre vigier traveled são paulo worked bohm three months ralph schiller student cosmologist peter bergmann assistant two years worked tiomno walther schützer mario bunge stayed work year
contact brazilian physicists mário schönberg jean meyer leite lopes discussions occasion visitors brazil including richard feynman isidor rabi léon rosenfeld carl friedrich von weizsäcker herbert anderson donald kerst marcos moshinsky alejandro medina former assistant heisenberg guido beck encouraged work helped obtain funding
brazilian cnpq explicitly supported work causal theory funded several researchers around bohm
work vigier beginning long-standing cooperation two louis de broglie particular connections hydrodynamics model proposed madelung
yet causal theory met much resistance skepticism many physicists holding copenhagen interpretation viable approach quantum mechanics
1951 1953 bohm david pines published articles introduced random phase approximation proposed plasmon
bohm aharonov form epr paradox 1955 bohm relocated israel spent two years working technion haifa
there met sarah saral woolfson
couple married 1956
1957 bohm student yakir aharonov published new version einstein–podolsky–rosen epr paradox reformulating original argument terms spin
form epr paradox discussed john stewart bell famous paper 1964
aharonov–bohm effect main article aharonov–bohm effect schematic double-slit experiment aharonov–bohm effect observed electrons pass through two slits interfering observation screen interference pattern shifted magnetic field turned cylindrical solenoid
1957 bohm relocated united kingdom research fellow university bristol
1959 bohm aharonov discovered aharonov–bohm effect showing how magnetic field affect region space field shielded although vector potential vanish there
showed first time magnetic vector potential hitherto mathematical convenience real physical quantum effects
1961 bohm made professor theoretical physics university london's birkbeck college collected papers kept
implicate explicate order main article implicate explicate order birkbeck college much work bohm basil hiley expanded notion implicate explicate generative orders proposed bohm
view bohm hiley things such particles objects indeed subjects exist semi-autonomous quasi-local features underlying activity
these features considered independent up certain level approximation certain criteria fulfilled
picture classical limit quantum phenomena terms condition action function much greater planck's constant indicates such criterion
used word holomovement activity such orders
holonomic model brain main article holonomic brain theory holographic reconstruction each region photographic plate contains whole image
collaboration stanford neuroscientist karl pribram bohm involved early development holonomic model functioning brain model human cognition drastically different conventionally accepted ideas
[not citation given] bohm worked pribram theory brain operates manner similar hologram accordance quantum mathematical principles characteristics wave patterns
thought system bohm alarmed considered increasing imbalance man nature among peoples well within people themselves
bohm mused begins wonder going happen human race
technology keeps advancing greater greater power either good destruction
goes ask source trouble? i'm saying source basically thought
many people think such statement crazy because thought thing solve our problems
that's part our tradition
yet looks thing use solve our problems source our problems
it's like going doctor having make you ill
fact 20% medical cases apparently going
case thought it's far over 20%
bohm's view
general tacit assumption thought it's just telling you way things it's doing anything 'you' inside there deciding info
you don't decide info
thought runs you
thought however gives false info you running you controls thought
whereas actually thought controls each us
thought creating divisions out itself then saying there naturally
another major feature thought thought doesn't know doing something then struggles against doing
doesn't want know doing
thought struggles against results trying avoid those unpleasant results while keeping way thinking
call sustained incoherence
bohm thus proposes book thought system pervasive systematic nature thought mean thought whole thing thought felt body whole society sharing thoughts it's process
essential me break up because it's process somebody else's thoughts become my thoughts vice versa
therefore wrong misleading break up my thoughts your thoughts my feelings these feelings those feelings
say thought makes often called modern language system
system means set connected things parts
way people commonly use word nowadays means something whose parts mutually interdependent their mutual action their meaning their existence
corporation organized system department department department
don't any meaning separately function together
also body system
society system sense
similarly thought system
system includes thoughts felts feelings includes state body includes whole society thought passing back forth people process thought evolved ancient times
system constantly engaged process development change evolution structure changes
although there certain features system become relatively fixed
call structure
thought constantly evolving can't say structure began
growth civilization developed great deal
probably very simple thought before civilization now become very complex ramified much incoherence before
now say system fault systematic fault
fault here there here fault throughout system
you picture that? everywhere nowhere
you may say see problem here will bring my thoughts bear problem
my thought part system
same fault fault i'm trying look similar fault
thought constantly creating problems way then trying solve them
tries solve them makes worse because doesn’t notice it's creating them thinks problems creates

article 1990 new theory relationship mind matter resumes view there exists close link mental processes whole notion active information suggests rudimentary mind-like behaviour matter
view mental processes well understood representing levels activity increasing subtlety act upon each other
recalls thought intricately connected physical reactions known everyday experience
yet mental side action response information need immediate rather cases least mediated suspension physical action resulting train thought
bohm suggests mental physical sides sees two poles unified whole closely interlinked each level information bridge link two sides
relationship mental matter may exist indefinitely great levels subtlety while nonetheless each kind level mind may relative autonomy stability
article concludes statement knowledge matter well mind changed such way support approach described here
pursue approach further might perhaps enable us extend our knowledge both poles new domains
further interests book creativity quoting work alfred korzybski bohm expressed view metaphysics expression world view thus regarded art form resembling poetry ways mathematics others rather attempt say something true reality whole
bohm keenly aware various ideas outside scientific mainstream
example book science order creativity bohm referred views various biologists evolution species included among these also rupert sheldrake
also quoted known ideas wilhelm reich
contrary many other scientists bohm priori exclude paranormal
bohm temporarily even held uri geller's bending keys spoons possible prompting warning remarks colleague hiley might undermine scientific credibility their work physics reported skeptical inquirer article martin gardner
gardner also critiqued views krishnamurti[dead link] whom bohm encountered 1959 whom bohm many exchanges thought
bohm's view interconnectedness mind matter occasion summarized even electron informed certain level mind gardner bohm flirted panpsychism
bohm dialogue main article bohm dialogue address societal problems during later years bohm proposal solution become known bohm dialogue equal status free space form most important prerequisites communication appreciation differing personal beliefs
essential ingredient form dialogue participants suspend immediate action judgment give themselves each other opportunity become aware thought process itself
bohm suggested these dialogue groups experienced sufficiently wide scale help overcome isolation fragmentation bohm observed currently present society
later years bohm continued work quantum physics past retirement 1987
final work posthumously published undivided universe ontological interpretation quantum theory 1993 resulted decades-long collaboration colleague basil hiley
also spoke audiences across europe north america importance dialogue form sociotherapy concept borrowed london psychiatrist practitioner group analysis patrick de mare series meetings dalai lama
elected fellow royal society 1990
near end life bohm began experience recurrence depression suffered earlier times life
admitted maudsley hospital south london 10 may
condition worsened decided treatment might help electroconvulsive therapy
bohm's wife consulted psychiatrist david shainberg bohm's long-time friend collaborator agreed electroconvulsive treatments probably option
bohm showed improvement treatments released 29 august
however depression returned treated medication
bohm died after suffering heart attack hendon london 27 october 1992 aged 74
traveling london taxicab day after getting no response passenger back seat few seconds driver turned back found bohm collapsed
