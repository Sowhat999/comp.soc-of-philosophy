1678 published true intellectual system universe first part wherein reason philosophy atheism confuted impossibility demonstrated imprimatur dated 1671
no published perhaps because theological clamour raised against first part
much cudworth's work still remains manuscript treatise concerning eternal immutable morality published 1731 treatise freewill edited john allen 1838 both connected design magnum opus intellectual system
intellectual system arose author tells us out discourse refuting fatal necessity determinism
enlarging plan proposed prove three matters existence god naturalness moral distinctions c reality human freedom
these three together make up intellectual opposed physical system universe opposed respectively three false principles atheism religious fatalism refers moral distinctions will god thirdly fatalism ancient stoics recognized god yet identified nature
immense fragment dealing atheism published author
cudworth criticizes two main forms materialistic atheism atomic adopted democritus epicurus hobbes hylozoic attributed strato lampsacus explains everything supposition inward self-organizing life matter
atomic atheism far important because hobbes great antagonist whom cudworth view supposed held
arises out combination two principles neither atheistic taken separately
atomism corporealism doctrine nothing exists body
example stoicism cudworth points out shows corporealism may theistic
cudworth plunges history atomism vast erudition
purely physical application theory fully accepts holds taught pythagoras empedocles fact nearly ancient philosophers perverted atheism democritus
first invented believes before trojan war sidonian thinker named moschus mochus identical moses old testament
dealing atheism cudworth's method marshal atheistic arguments elaborately elaborately dryden remarked raised such objections against being god providence many think answered them then last chapter itself long ordinary treatise confutes them reasons reading supply
subordinate matter book attracted much attention time conception plastic medium mere revival plato's world-soul meant explain existence laws nature without referring direct operation god
occasioned long-drawn controversy pierre bayle le clerc former maintaining latter denying plastic medium really favourable atheism
much favourable judgment must given upon short treatise eternal immutable morality deserves read those interested historical development british moral philosophy
answer hobbes's famous doctrine moral distinctions created state answer standpoint platonism
just knowledge contains permanent intelligible element over above flux sense-impressions there exist eternal immutable ideas morality
cudworth's ideas like plato's constant never-failing entity their own such see geometrical figures unlike plato's exist mind god whence communicated finite understandings
hence evident wisdom knowledge understanding eternal self-subsistent things superior matter sensible beings independent upon them also moral good evil
point cudworth stops does attempt give any list moral ideas
indeed cardinal weakness form intuitionism no satisfactory list given no moral principles constant never-failing entity definiteness concepts geometry these attacks uncontested â€” see example common sense tradition thomas reid james mc cosh oxford realists harold prichard sir william david ross
henry enchiridion ethicum attempts enumerate noemata moralia far being self-evident most moral axioms open serious controversy

day remains breadth scholarship strength thought tolerance honesty greatest glories english church
purposed build fortress should protect christianity against dangerous theories universe ancient modern
while genius marked every part features appeared gave rigidly orthodox serious misgivings
