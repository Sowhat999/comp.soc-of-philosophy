theology xenophanes' surviving writings display skepticism became commonly expressed during fourth century
satirized traditional religious views time human projections
aimed critique polytheistic religious views earlier greek poets own contemporaries homer hesiod fragment states attributed gods sorts things matters reproach censure among men theft adultery mutual deception
sextus empiricus reported such observations appreciated christian apologists
xenophanes quoted memorably clement alexandria arguing against conception gods fundamentally anthropomorphic cattle horses lions handsor paint their hands create works such men dohorses like horses cattle like cattlealso depict gods' shapes make their bodiesof such sort form themselves
ethiopians say their gods snub–nosed [σιμούς] black thracians pale red-haired
additional criticism gods found quote gods course revealed things mortals beginning rather seeking course time discover better
xenophanes trying say humans independent gods their intelligence discoveries science other areas result human work divine favors thus removing gods role receiving credit human accomplishment
other passages quoted clement alexandria argue against traditional greek conception gods include god greatest among gods humanslike mortals neither form nor thought
mortals think gods bornand mortals' own clothes voice form
regarding xenophanes' theology five key concepts god formed
god beyond human morality does resemble human form cannot die born god divine thus eternal no divine hierarchy exists god does intervene human affairs
while xenophanes rejecting homeric theology questioning presence divine entity rather philosophy critique ancient greek writers their conception divinity
there also concept god being whole universe essentially controlling while same time being physically unconnected
xenophanes espoused belief god supreme among gods men like mortals body mind
maintained there greatest god
god eternal being spherical form comprehending things within himself absolute mind thought therefore intelligent moves things bears no resemblance human nature either body mind
considered precursor parmenides spinoza
because development concept god greatest among gods men abstract universal unchanging immobile present xenophanes often seen first monotheists western philosophy religion although quotation seems point xenophanes's monotheism also refers multiple gods supreme god greater

argument considered rebuke anaximenes' air theory
detailed account wet dry form theory found hippolytus' refutation
also holds there infinite number worlds overlapping time
xenophanes concluded examination fossils water once must covered earth's surface
use evidence important step advancing simply stating idea backing up evidence observation
knowing xenophanes credited being first philosophers distinguish true belief knowledge further developed prospect you know something really know
due lack whole works xenophanes lot meaning lost large amount guessing hand implication knowing being something deeper clearer truth may special implications may mean you cannot know something just looking
known most widest variety evidence considered xenophanes surest way prove theory
epistemology still influential today held there actually exists truth reality humans mortals unable know
karl popper read xenophanes saying possible act basis working hypotheses—we may act knew truth long know extremely unlikely
xenophanes' views then might serve basis critical rationalism
