notions race ethnicity completely odds european antisemitism 19 th 20 th centuries
renan following long history persecution jews nations ages persecuted you there must motive behind
jew up our own time insinuated himself everywhere claiming protection common law reality remaining outside common law
retained own status wished same guarantees everyone else over above own exceptions special laws
desired advantages nations without being nation without helping bear burdens nations
no people ever able tolerate
nations military creations founded maintained sword work peasants soldiers towards establishing them jews contributed nothing
herein great fallacy inspired israelite pretensions
tolerated alien useful country condition country does allow itself invaded
fair claim family rights house built like those birds come take up their quarters nest does belong them like crustaceans steal shell another species
