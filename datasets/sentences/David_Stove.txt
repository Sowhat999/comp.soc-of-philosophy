philosophy science induction probability stove's starting point philosophy science humean argument inductive scepticism
stove great admirer david hume thought argument contemporary hume scholars hesitate attribute hume fallacious harmful effects causes though modern nervousness
stove took main task refute hume's inductive scepticism
there two aspects task
first negative show hume's argument failed
second positive provide justification induction
stove's argument negative task
consider claim such ravens black
hume argued don't know priori cannot entailed necessary truths
nor deduced our observations ravens
derive these observations add premise effect unobserved like observed
no priori justification premise any attempt derive empirical means circular
hume concluded induction unjustified
stove argued hume presuming deductivism stove's best-known expression point paper titled 'hume probability induction'
view explicitly implicitly accepted many modern philosophers valid sound arguments ones entail arguments' conclusions
accept premises support conclusion greater lesser degree without entailing then no need add premise effect unobserved will like observed—the observational premises themselves provide strong support conclusion make likely true
stove argued nothing hume's argument shows cannot case hume's argument does go through unless defend deductivism
argument wasn't entirely original stove never articulated well before
since stove put forward philosophers come accept defeats hume's argument
positive task attempted stove probability hume's inductive scepticism 1973 later rationality induction 1986
stove's principal positive argument induction presented latter book developed argument put forward stove's heroes late donald cary williams formerly professor harvard university book ground induction
stove argued statistical truth great majority possible subsets specified size long size too small similar larger population belong
example majority subsets contain 3000 ravens you form raven population similar population itself applies no matter how large raven population long infinite
consequently stove argued you find yourself such subset then chances subset ones similar population you justified concluding likely subset 'matches' population reasonably closely
situation analogous drawing ball out barrel balls 99% red
such case you 99% chance drawing red ball
similarly getting sample ravens probability very high sample matching 'representative' ones
long you no reason think your sample unrepresentative you justified thinking probably although certainly representative
stove also worked falsificationism raven paradox grue color inductive logic
polemics against popper other 'irrationalists' section biographical article needs additional citations verification

contentious material living persons unsourced poorly sourced must removed immediately especially potentially libelous harmful
october stove became best known wider intellectual community attacks karl popper falsificationist philosophy science well influential philosophies thomas kuhn paul feyerabend
book popper after four modern irrationalists 1982 reprinted two new editions recent years under titles scientific irrationalism origins postmodern cult anything goes origins cult scientific irrationalism
stove claimed expose methods popper kuhn lakatos feyerabend managed make their purportedly untenable philosophies seem respectable
such method stove claimed neutralizing success words
stove argued philosophies these authors such things progress discovery evidence knowledge exist position stated openly consistently maintained then few ever taken these philosophies seriously
stove contended these authors got around problem using these success words scare quotes e
fact these words used regularly even scare quotes gave impression view being put forward somehow rejecting these concepts
another method stove attributed popper kuhn lakatos feyerabend called sabotaging logical expressions
practise robbing logical statements their logical force placing them epistemic contexts example instead saying p proof q say generally believed scientists p proof q
produces stove calls ghost logical statement gives impression serious statements logic being made really being made sociological historical claims immune criticism logical grounds
stove charged popper enfant terriblisme claiming work motivated levity failure take truth topics under discussion seriously
feyerabend guilty sin obvious even supporters nor does deny accusation against apparently ultra-serious popper seems first glance surprising
stove nevertheless argued popper product jazz age words cole porter day's night today vice versa popper's jazz age played out intellectual world rather bohemian parties
kuhn's writings other hand free levity
stove because kuhn [
earnest irrationalist philosophy science while others
actually believes others imply pretend believe
even bids fair immense influence writings 'the rabble without doors' make irrationalism majority opinion
plato cult plato cult other philosophical follies even controversial popper after least fact analyses often sociological satirical philosophical
among topics stove attacked nelson goodman's worldmaking external world scepticism solipsism popper again robert nozick's idea explanation should replace argument stove argued distinction vacuous product desire appear non-coercive
stove also harshly criticised philosophical idealism
stove claimed george berkeley try derive non-tautological conclusion tautological reasoning
argued berkeley's case fallacy obvious because premise ambiguous meaning tautological logically equivalent conclusion
stove concluded hard avoid view idealism just religious substitute
immanuel kant say kant's questions strange arresting no once heard them ever forgets them
just reverse answers them no ever remember these are! there simple reason questions never get answered
once served excuse darkening sufficient area wood-pulp just get lost
book ends stove claiming show wrong our thoughts? just how easily abstract thought go wrong seemingly endless ways how little know these ways
end gave list forty propositions number 3 argued demonstrate thought going wrong yet say few these particular disease thought occurring
example three lies two four convention mathematicians adopted
there integer two four three true name nature revealed
three incomplete object now coming existence
tie unites number three properties such primeness inexplicable
book stove also coined phrase horror victorianorum horror victorians satirise perceived irrational modernist distaste victorian culture
concept taken up within design art history characterise unthinkingly visceral dislike victorian architecture art design
political philosophy after brief flirtation marxism stove abandoned left
views summed-up well paper why you should conservative reprinted part columbus argument
main argument paper just there many ways make television set worse those will make better there many ways make society worse make better
think otherwise because fed one-sided diet examples such christopher columbus nicolaus copernicus abraham lincoln rather pol pot maximilien robespierre adolf hitler joseph stalin
odds change will make things worse better
hence rational cautious conservative proposed changes
stove concluded there reason discourage innovation encourage
stove believed proposed changes should radical should very carefully considered should very good supporting evidence their side before implemented
however according stove current opinion believed opposite very fact idea innovation argument favour even obligation take innovations seriously simply because innovations
stove also regularly derided enlightenment view progress
view john maynard keynes attributed bertrand russell human affairs carried after most irrational fashion remedy quite simple easy since carry them rationally
there many people modern times stove thought hold such beliefs past world dark place run according foolish principles now things will run properly world will vastly improved result
asked reason think darkness suddenly give way light? why will much better running things past generations? education answer often given reply question stove deeply sceptical effectiveness education making world better place
stove felt learning great value itself unlike plato think educated ruler better will ruling
evolution final years stove began examine criticise evolutionary biology
surprised dismayed many supporters
however stove's attack biological evolution radical appeared accepted evolution true living things no objection natural selection being true primitive organisms
wanted attack allegedly distorted view human beings proposed ultra-darwinists
example misattributed j
haldane's famous quip lay down my life two brothers eight cousins oxford biologist w
hamilton recently developed ideas kin selection suggested such ideas probably false certainly unverified
stove argued these sorts strong claims often made hard-line sociobiologists yet seldom pointed out even many their opponents
stove also argued leading evolutionary biologists confused altruism often talking though altruism didn't really exist sort sham
should stove contended explained origins altruism
damage done according stove many people now share suspicion altruism least degree contributed growth cynicism selfishness
furthermore stove argued evolutionary theorists difficulties trying reconcile their theory fact there appears no darwinian fight survival modern times stove harshly criticised saw attempts patch these perceived holes up calls 'cave men' theory view t
huxley often resorted says while darwinian struggle no longer occurs existing human populations amongst cave-men
'hard man' says there still evolutionary struggle survival going around us blind stove claimed herbert spencer hard man
'soft man' however never notices inconsistency
stove also claimed simple malthusian view population many evolutionary scientists accept true humans humans continue expanding population until eaten up their food supplies then results massive deaths starvation
fact population growth richer nations typically slower poorer nations
sort view defended recent years population economists such julian lincoln simon
essays darwinism collected book darwinian fairytales
stove's views race gender stove intellectual capacity women 1990 stated belief intellectual capacity women whole inferior men
racial other antagonisms 1989 stove asserted racism form prejudice common sense almost everyone unites declaring 'racism' false detestable
yet absolutely everyone knows true
argued while these differences likely caused cultural rather genetic factors statistical associations existed rational make decisions based them
these views clashed mainstream notions political correctness led being threatened disciplinary action sydney university
