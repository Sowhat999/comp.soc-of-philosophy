european review cambridge university press

caplan’s myth rational voter why democracies choose bad policies received rave reviews
these reviews appear failed note caplan’s book celebrates market denigrates democracy very time markets worldwide failed democracies ridden rescue
thus appears undermined fatally events occurred published caplan artfully omits mention recent paperback edition
caplan’s book fact stands long tradition anti-democratic writings argue elite must rule
elite free-market economists
elite no longer good odour since financial crisis climate crisis occurred became starkly evident
critical notice also points out numerous caplan’s key claims such individual voters zero effect election results empirically false
