contributions psychiatry jaspers' dissatisfaction popular understanding mental illness led question both diagnostic criteria methods clinical psychiatry
published paper 1910 addressed problem whether paranoia aspect personality result biological changes
whilst broaching new ideas article introduced psychiatry until then rather unusual method study
unlike freud jaspers studied patients detail giving biographical information people concerned well providing notes how patients themselves felt their symptoms
become known biographical method now forms mainstay modern psychiatric above psychotherapeutic practice
karl jaspers allgemeine psychopathologie first print 1913
jaspers set writing views mental illness book published 1913 general psychopathology
work become classic psychiatric literature many modern diagnostic criteria stem ideas contained within them
particular importance jaspers believed psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms particularly psychosis their form rather their content
example diagnosing hallucination fact person experiences visual phenomena no sensory stimuli account form assumes importance patient sees content
jaspers felt psychiatrists also diagnose delusions same way
argued clinicians should consider belief delusional based content belief based way patient holds such belief see delusion further discussion
jaspers also distinguished primary secondary delusions
defined primary delusions autochthonous meaning arising without apparent cause appearing incomprehensible terms normal mental processes
slightly different use term autochthonous usual medical sociological meaning indigenous
secondary delusions other hand classified influenced person's background current situation mental state
jaspers considered primary delusions ultimately 'un-understandable' believed no coherent reasoning process existed behind their formation

contributions philosophy theology most commentators associate jaspers philosophy existentialism part because draws largely upon existentialist roots nietzsche kierkegaard part because theme individual freedom permeates work
philosophy 3 vols 1932 jaspers gave view history philosophy introduced major themes
beginning modern science empiricism jaspers points out question reality confront borders empirical scientific method simply cannot transcend
point individual faces choice sink despair resignation take leap faith toward jaspers calls transcendence
making leap individuals confront their own limitless freedom jaspers calls existenz finally experience authentic existence
[citation needed] transcendence paired term encompassing later works jaspers exists beyond world time space
jaspers' formulation transcendence ultimate non-objectivity no-thing-ness led many philosophers argue ultimately jaspers became monist though jaspers himself continually stressed necessity recognizing validity concepts both subjectivity objectivity
[citation needed] although rejected explicit religious doctrines including notion personal god jaspers influenced contemporary theology through philosophy transcendence limits human experience
mystic christian traditions influenced jaspers himself tremendously particularly those meister eckhart nicholas cusa
also took active interest eastern philosophies particularly buddhism developed theory axial age period substantial philosophical religious development
jaspers also entered public debates rudolf bultmann wherein jaspers roundly criticized bultmann's demythologizing christianity
[citation needed] jaspers extensively threat human freedom posed modern science modern economic political institutions
during world war ii abandon teaching post because wife jewish
after war resumed teaching position work question german guilt unabashedly examined culpability germany whole atrocities hitler's third reich
following quote second world war atrocities used end sixth episode bbc documentary series nazis warning history
happened warning
forget guilt
must continually remembered
possible happen remains possible happen again any minute
knowledge prevented
jaspers's major works lengthy detailed seem daunting their complexity
last great attempt systematic philosophy existenz — von wahrheit truth — yet appeared english
however also shorter works most notably philosophy everyman
two major proponents phenomenological hermeneutics namely paul ricoeur student jaspers hans-georg gadamer jaspers's successor heidelberg both display jaspers's influence their works
political views jaspers valued humanism continuity integral cultural tradition political spheres
strongly opposed totalitarian despotism warned increasing tendency towards technocracy regime regards humans mere instruments science ideological goals
also skeptical majoritarian democracy
thus supported form governance guaranteed individual freedom limited government yet rooted authentic tradition guided intellectual elite
jaspers' influences jaspers held kierkegaard nietzsche two most important figures post-kantian philosophy
compilation great philosophers approach presentation kierkegaard trepidation
next nietzsche rather prior nietzsche consider most important thinker our post-kantian age
goethe hegel epoch reached conclusion our prevalent way thinking positivistic natural-scientific cannot really considered philosophy
jaspers also questions whether two philosophers taught
kierkegaard least jaspers felt kierkegaard's whole method indirect communication precludes any attempts properly expound thought any sort systematic teaching
though jaspers certainly indebted kierkegaard nietzsche also owes much traditional philosophers especially kant plato
walter kaufmann argues shakespeare existentialism though jaspers certainly indebted kierkegaard nietzsche closest kant's philosophy
jaspers too often seen heir nietzsche kierkegaard whom many ways less close kant
kantian antinomies kant's concern realm decision freedom faith become exemplary jaspers
even kant away knowledge make room faith jaspers values nietzsche large measure because thinks nietzsche away knowledge thus making room jaspers' philosophic faith
supported jaspers' essay my philosophy see external links below while still school spinoza first
kant then became philosopher me remained
nietzsche gained importance me late magnificent revelation nihilism task overcoming
