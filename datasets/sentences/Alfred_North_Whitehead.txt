principia mathematica's purpose describe set axioms inference rules symbolic logic mathematical truths principle proven
whitehead russell working such foundational level mathematics logic took them until page 86 volume ii prove 1+1=2 proof humorously accompanied comment above proposition occasionally useful
whitehead russell thought originally principia mathematica take year complete ended up taking them ten years
add insult injury came time publication three-volume work massive 2000 pages audience narrow professional mathematicians initially published loss 600 pounds 300 paid cambridge university press 200 royal society london 50 apiece whitehead russell themselves
despite initial loss today there likely no major academic library world does hold copy principia mathematica
ultimate substantive legacy principia mathematica mixed
generally accepted kurt gödel's incompleteness theorem 1931 definitively demonstrated any set axioms inference rules proposed encapsulate mathematics there fact truths mathematics deduced them hence principia mathematica never achieve aims
however gödel come conclusion without whitehead russell's book
way principia mathematica's legacy might described key role disproving possibility achieving own stated goals
beyond somewhat ironic legacy book popularized modern mathematical logic drew important connections logic epistemology metaphysics

whitehead's most complete work education 1929 book aims education other essays collected numerous essays addresses whitehead subject published 1912 1927
essay aims education derived name delivered address 1916 whitehead president london branch mathematical association
cautioned against teaching called inert ideas ideas disconnected scraps information no application real life culture
opined education inert ideas useless above things harmful
rather teach small parts large number subjects whitehead advocated teaching relatively few important concepts student organically link many different areas knowledge discovering their application actual life
whitehead education should exact opposite multidisciplinary value-free school model should transdisciplinary laden values general principles provide students bedrock wisdom help them make connections areas knowledge usually regarded separate
order make sort teaching reality however whitehead pointed need minimize importance radically alter standard examinations school entrance
whitehead writes every school bound pain extinction train boys small set definite examinations
no headmaster free hand develop general education specialist studies accordance opportunities school created staff environment class boys endowments
suggest no system external tests aims primarily examining individual scholars result anything educational waste
whitehead argued curriculum should developed specifically own students own staff else risk total stagnation interrupted occasional movements group inert ideas another
above else educational writings whitehead emphasized importance imagination free play ideas
essay universities their function whitehead writes provocatively imagination imagination divorced facts way illuminating facts
works eliciting general principles apply facts exist then intellectual survey alternative possibilities consistent those principles
enables men construct intellectual vision new world
whitehead's philosophy education might adequately summarized statement knowledge does keep any better fish

ironically later life whitehead become 20 th century's foremost metaphysicians
however interest metaphysics philosophical investigation nature universe existence become unfashionable time whitehead began writing earnest 1920 s
ever-more impressive accomplishments empirical science led general consensus academia development comprehensive metaphysical systems waste time because subject empirical testing
whitehead unimpressed objection
notes students 1927 class whitehead quoted saying every scientific man order preserve reputation say dislikes metaphysics
means dislikes having metaphysics criticized
whitehead's view scientists philosophers make metaphysical assumptions how universe works time such assumptions easily seen precisely because remain unexamined unquestioned
while whitehead acknowledged philosophers never hope finally formulate these metaphysical first principles argued people need continually re-imagine their basic assumptions how universe works philosophy science make any real progress even progress remains permanently asymptotic
reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations essential both good science good philosophy
perhaps foremost among whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions cartesian idea reality fundamentally constructed bits matter exist totally independently another rejected favor event-based process ontology events primary fundamentally interrelated dependent another
also argued most basic elements reality regarded experiential indeed everything constituted experience
used term experience very broadly even inanimate processes such electron collisions manifest degree experience
went against descartes' separation two different kinds real existence either exclusively material else exclusively mental
whitehead referred metaphysical system philosophy organism become known widely process philosophy
whitehead's philosophy highly original soon garnered interest philosophical circles

impressive different whitehead's philosophy 1924 invited join faculty harvard university professor philosophy 63 years age
eckhart hall university chicago
beginning arrival henry nelson wieman 1927 chicago's divinity school become closely associated whitehead's thought thirty years
say whitehead's thought widely accepted even well-understood
philosophical work generally considered among most difficult understand western canon
even professional philosophers struggled follow whitehead's writings
famous story illustrating level difficulty whitehead's philosophy centers around delivery whitehead's gifford lectures 1927–28 following arthur eddington's lectures year previous whitehead later publish process reality eddington marvellous popular lecturer enthralled audience 600 entire course
same audience turned up whitehead's first lecture completely unintelligible merely world large elect
my father remarked me afterwards known whitehead well suspected imposter making up went along
audience subsequent lectures half dozen
indeed may inappropriate speculate fair portion respect generally shown whitehead philosophical peers time arose their sheer bafflement
distinguished university chicago divinity school theologian shailer mathews once remarked whitehead's 1926 book religion making infuriating must say embarrassing well read page after page relatively familiar words without understanding single sentence
however mathews' frustration whitehead's books negatively affect interest
fact there numerous philosophers theologians chicago's divinity school perceived importance whitehead doing without fully grasping details implications
1927 invited america's whitehead experts henry nelson wieman chicago give lecture explaining whitehead's thought
wieman's lecture brilliant promptly hired faculty taught there twenty years least thirty years afterward chicago's divinity school closely associated whitehead's thought
shortly after whitehead's book process reality appeared 1929 wieman famously 1930 review many people will read whitehead's recent book generation many will read any generation
influence will radiate through concentric circles popularization until common man will think work light knowing whence light came
after few decades discussion analysis will able understand readily now done
wieman's words proved prophetic
though process reality called arguably most impressive single metaphysical text twentieth century little-read little-understood partly because demands isabelle stengers puts readers accept adventure questions will separate them every consensus
whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions how universe works doing managed anticipate number 21 st century scientific philosophical problems provide novel solutions
whitehead's conception reality whitehead convinced scientific notion matter misleading way describing ultimate nature things
1925 book science modern world there persists
[a] fixed scientific cosmology presupposes ultimate fact irreducible brute matter material spread through space flux configurations
itself such material senseless valueless purposeless
just does does following fixed routine imposed external relations spring nature being
assumption call 'scientific materialism
also assumption shall challenge being entirely unsuited scientific situation now arrived
whitehead's view there number problems notion irreducible brute matter
first obscures minimizes importance change
thinking any material thing like rock person being fundamentally same thing throughout time any changes being secondary nature scientific materialism hides fact nothing ever stays same
whitehead change fundamental inescapable emphasizes things flow
whitehead's view then concepts such quality matter form problematic
these classical concepts fail adequately account change overlook active experiential nature most basic elements world
useful abstractions world's basic building blocks
ordinarily conceived single person instance philosophically described continuum overlapping events
after people change time because aged another second further experience
these occasions experience logically distinct progressively connected whitehead calls society events
assuming enduring objects most real fundamental things universe materialists mistaken abstract concrete whitehead calls fallacy misplaced concreteness
put another way thing person often seen having defining essence core identity unchanging describes thing person really
way thinking things people seen fundamentally same through time any changes being qualitative secondary their core identity e
mark's hair turned gray gotten older still same person
whitehead's cosmology fundamentally existent things discrete occasions experience overlap another time space jointly make up enduring person thing
other hand ordinary thinking often regards essence thing identity/core person abstract generalization regarded person thing's most important salient features across time
identities define people people define identities
everything changes moment moment think anything having enduring essence misses fact things flow though often useful way speaking
whitehead pointed limitations language main culprits maintaining materialistic way thinking acknowledged may difficult ever wholly move past such ideas everyday speech
after each moment each person's life hardly given different proper name easy convenient think people objects remaining fundamentally same things rather constantly keeping mind each thing different thing moment ago
yet limitations everyday living everyday speech should prevent people realizing material substances essences convenient generalized description continuum particular concrete processes
no questions ten-year-old person quite different time she turns thirty years old many ways same person whitehead points out philosophically ontologically sound think person same second next
john locke whitehead's primary influences
preface process reality whitehead writer most fully anticipated main positions philosophy organism john locke essay
second problem materialism obscures importance relations
sees every object distinct discrete other objects
each object simply inert clump matter externally related other things
idea matter primary makes people think objects being fundamentally separate time space necessarily related anything
whitehead's view relations take primary role perhaps even important relata themselves
student taking notes whitehead's fall 1924 classes reality applies connections relatively things connected
real real [they are] absolutely real independent each other
fact whitehead describes any entity sense nothing nothing less sum relations other entities synthesis reaction world around
real thing just forces rest universe way conform say theoretically thing made strictly no difference any other entity
related any other entity really exist
relations secondary thing thing
must emphasized however entity merely sum relations also valuation them reaction them
whitehead creativity absolute principle existence every entity whether human being tree electron degree novelty how responds other entities fully determined causal mechanistic laws
course most entities consciousness
human being's actions cannot predicted same tree's roots will grow how electron will move whether will rain tomorrow
moreover inability predict electron's movement instance due faulty understanding inadequate technology rather fundamental creativity/freedom entities means there will remain phenomena unpredictable
other side creativity/freedom absolute principle every entity constrained social structure existence
relations each actual entity must conform settled conditions world around
freedom exists within limits
entity's uniqueness individuality arise own self-determination just how will take account world within limits set
summary whitehead rejects idea separate unchanging bits matter most basic building blocks reality favor idea reality interrelated events process
conceives reality composed processes dynamic becoming rather static being emphasizing physical things change evolve changeless essences such matter mere abstractions interrelated events final real things make up world
theory perception since whitehead's metaphysics described universe entities experience needed new way describing perception limited living self-conscious beings
term coined prehension comes latin prehensio meaning seize
term meant indicate kind perception conscious unconscious applying people well electrons
also intended make clear whitehead's rejection theory representative perception mind private ideas other entities
whitehead term prehension indicates perceiver actually incorporates aspects perceived thing itself
way entities constituted their perceptions relations rather being independent them
further whitehead regards perception occurring two modes causal efficacy physical prehension presentational immediacy conceptual prehension
whitehead describes causal efficacy experience dominating primitive living organisms sense fate emerged fate towards go
other words sense causal relations entities feeling being influenced affected surrounding environment unmediated senses
presentational immediacy other hand usually referred pure sense perception unmediated any causal symbolic interpretation even unconscious interpretation
other words pure appearance may may delusive e
mistaking image mirror real thing
higher organisms like people these two modes perception combine whitehead terms symbolic reference links appearance causation process automatic both people animals difficulty refraining
way illustration whitehead uses example person's encounter chair
ordinary person looks up sees colored shape immediately infers chair
however artist whitehead supposes might jumped notion chair instead might stopped mere contemplation beautiful color beautiful shape
normal human reaction most people place objects categories habit instinct without even thinking
moreover animals same thing
using same example whitehead points out dog acted immediately hypothesis chair jumped onto way using such
way symbolic reference fusion pure sense perceptions hand causal relations other fact causal relationships dominate basic mentality dog illustrates while sense perceptions indicate higher grade mentality artist illustrates
evolution value whitehead believed asking questions basic facts existence questions value purpose never fully escaped
borne out thoughts abiogenesis hypothetical natural process life arises simple organic compounds
whitehead makes startling observation life comparatively deficient survival value
humans exist hundred years rocks eight hundred million then forced ask why complex organisms ever evolved first place whitehead humorously notes certainly appear because better game rocks around them
then observes mark higher forms life actively engaged modifying their environment activity theorizes directed toward three-fold goal living living well living better
other words whitehead sees life directed toward purpose increasing own satisfaction
without such goal sees rise life totally unintelligible
whitehead there no such thing wholly inert matter
instead things measure freedom creativity however small allows them least partly self-directed
process philosopher david ray griffin coined term panexperientialism idea entities experience describe whitehead's view distinguish panpsychism idea matter consciousness
god henri bergson william james john dewey am also greatly indebted bergson william james john dewey
my preoccupations rescue their type thought charge anti-intellectualism rightly wrongly associated
alfred north whitehead process reality preface
whitehead's idea god differs traditional monotheistic notions
perhaps most famous pointed criticism christian conception god church gave unto god attributes belonged exclusively caesar
here whitehead criticizing christianity defining god primarily divine king imposes will world whose most important attribute power
opposed most widely accepted forms christianity whitehead emphasized idea god called brief galilean vision humility does emphasize ruling caesar ruthless moralist unmoved mover
dwells upon tender elements world slowly quietness operates love finds purpose present immediacy kingdom world
love neither rules nor unmoved also little oblivious morals
does look future finds own reward immediate present
should emphasized however whitehead god necessarily tied religion
rather springing primarily religious faith whitehead saw god necessary metaphysical system
system required order exist among possibilities order allowed novelty world provided aim entities
whitehead posited these ordered potentials exist called primordial nature god
however whitehead also interested religious experience
led reflect intensively saw second nature god consequent nature
whitehead's conception god dipolar entity called fresh theological thinking
primordial nature described unlimited conceptual realization absolute wealth potentiality
unlimited possibility universe
primordial nature eternal unchanging providing entities universe possibilities realization
whitehead also calls primordial aspect lure feeling eternal urge desire pulling entities universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities
god's consequent nature other hand anything unchanging god's reception world's activity
whitehead puts [god] saves world passes immediacy own life
judgment tenderness loses nothing saved
other words god saves cherishes experiences forever those experiences go change way god interacts world
way god really changed happens world wider universe lending actions finite creatures eternal significance
whitehead thus sees god world fulfilling another
sees entities world fluent changing things yearn permanence god provide taking them god's self thereafter changing god affecting rest universe throughout time
other hand sees god permanent deficient actuality change alone god merely eternally unrealized possibilities requires world actualize them
god gives creatures permanence while creatures give god actuality change
here worthwhile quote whitehead length way god completed individual fluent satisfactions finite fact temporal occasions completed their everlasting union their transformed selves purged conformation eternal order final absolute 'wisdom
final summary expressed terms group antitheses whose apparent self-contradictions depend neglect diverse categories existence
each antithesis there shift meaning converts opposition contrast
true say god permanent world fluent world permanent god fluent
true say god world many world god many
true say comparison world god actual eminently comparison god world actual eminently
true say world immanent god god immanent world
true say god transcends world world transcends god
true say god creates world world creates god
done world transformed reality heaven reality heaven passes back world
sense god great companion fellow-sufferer understands
above whitehead's most evocative writing god powerful enough inspire movement known process theology vibrant theological school thought continues thrive today
religion whitehead core religion individual
while acknowledged individuals cannot ever fully separated their society argued life internal fact own sake before external fact relating others
most famous remark religion religion individual does own solitariness
you never solitary you never religious
whitehead saw religion system general truths transformed person's character
took special care note while religion often good influence necessarily good idea called dangerous delusion e
religion might encourage violent extermination rival religion's adherents
however while whitehead saw religion beginning solitariness also saw religion necessarily expanding beyond individual
keeping process metaphysics relations primary religion necessitates realization value objective world community derivative interrelations component individuals
other words universe community makes itself whole through relatedness each individual entity others meaning value exist individual alone context universal community
whitehead writes further each entity find no such value till merged individual claim objective universe
religion world-loyalty
spirit once surrenders itself universal claim appropriates itself
way individual universal/social aspects religion mutually dependent
whitehead also described religion technically ultimate craving infuse insistent particularity emotion non-temporal generality primarily belongs conceptual thought alone
other words religion takes deeply felt emotions contextualizes them within system general truths world helping people identify their wider meaning significance
whitehead religion served kind bridge philosophy emotions purposes particular society
task religion make philosophy applicable everyday lives ordinary people
influence legacy isabelle stengers whiteheadians recruited among both philosophers theologians palette enriched practitioners most diverse horizons ecology feminism practices unite political struggle spirituality sciences education
indeed recent decades attention whitehead's work become widespread interest extending intellectuals europe china coming such diverse fields ecology physics biology education economics psychology
first theologians attempt interact whitehead's thought future archbishop canterbury william temple
temple's gifford lectures 1932-1934 subsequently published nature man god whitehead number philosophers emergent evolution approach temple interacts
however until 1970 s 1980 s whitehead's thought drew much attention outside small group philosophers theologians primarily americans even today considered especially influential outside relatively specialized circles
early followers whitehead found primarily university chicago's divinity school henry nelson wieman initiated interest whitehead's work last thirty years
professors such wieman charles hartshorne bernard loomer bernard meland daniel day williams made whitehead's philosophy arguably most important intellectual thread running through divinity school
taught generations whitehead scholars most notable john
cobb jr
although interest whitehead since faded chicago's divinity school cobb effectively grabbed torch planted firmly claremont california began teaching claremont school theology 1958 founded center process studies david ray griffin 1973
largely due cobb's influence today claremont remains strongly identified whitehead's process thought
while claremont remains most concentrated hub whiteheadian activity place whitehead's thought currently seems growing most quickly china
order address challenges modernization industrialization china begun blend traditions taoism buddhism confucianism whitehead's constructive post-modern philosophy order create ecological civilization
date chinese government encouraged building twenty-three university-based centers study whitehead's philosophy books process philosophers john cobb david ray griffin becoming required reading chinese graduate students
cobb attributed china's interest process philosophy partly whitehead's stress mutual interdependence humanity nature well emphasis educational system includes teaching values rather simply bare facts
overall however whitehead's influence very difficult characterize
english-speaking countries primary works little-studied outside claremont select number liberal graduate-level theology philosophy programs
outside these circles influence relatively small diffuse tended come chiefly through work students admirers rather whitehead himself
instance whitehead teacher long-time friend collaborator bertrand russell also taught supervised dissertation willard van orman quine both whom important figures analytic philosophy dominant strain philosophy english-speaking countries 20 th century
whitehead also high-profile admirers continental tradition such french post-structuralist philosopher gilles deleuze once dryly remarked whitehead stands provisionally last great anglo-american philosopher before wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion sufficiency terror
french sociologist anthropologist bruno latour even went far call whitehead greatest philosopher 20 th century
deleuze's latour's opinions however minority ones whitehead recognized particularly influential within most dominant philosophical schools
impossible say exactly why whitehead's influence widespread may partly due metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive such assertion matter abstraction inclusion theistic elements philosophy perception metaphysics itself passé simply sheer difficulty density prose
process philosophy theology philosopher nicholas rescher
rescher proponent both whiteheadian process philosophy american pragmatism
historically whitehead's work most influential field american progressive theology

rather seeing god impassive emotionless process theologians view god fellow sufferer understands being supremely affected temporal events

however process theology formulated wide variety ways
