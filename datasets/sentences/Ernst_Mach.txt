father graduated charles university prague acted tutor noble brethon family zlín eastern moravia
grandfather wenzl lanhaus administrator estate chirlitz also master builder streets there
activities field later influenced theoretical work ernst mach
sources give mach's birthplace turas/tuřany now also part brno site chirlitz registry-office
peregrin weiss baptized ernst mach roman catholic church turas/tuřany
despite catholic background later became atheist theory life compared buddhism
up age 14 mach received education home parents
then entered gymnasium kroměříž german kremsier studied three years
1855 became student university vienna
there studied physics semester medical physiology receiving doctorate physics 1860 habilitation following year
early work focused doppler effect optics acoustics
1864 took job professor mathematics university graz having turned down position chair surgery university salzburg 1866 appointed professor physics
during period mach continued work psycho-physics sensory perception
1867 took chair experimental physics charles university prague stayed 28 years before returning vienna
mach's main contribution physics involved description photographs spark shock-waves then ballistic shock-waves
described how bullet shell moved faster speed sound created compression air front
using schlieren photography son ludwig able photograph shadows invisible shock waves
during early 1890 s ludwig able invent interferometer allowed much clearer photographs
mach also made many contributions psychology physiology including anticipation gestalt phenomena discovery oblique effect mach bands inhibition-influenced type visual illusion especially discovery non-acoustic function inner ear helps control human balance
best-known mach's ideas so-called mach principle concerning physical origin inertia
never written down mach given graphic verbal form attributed philipp frank mach himself subway jerks it's fixed stars throw you down
mach also became well known philosophy developed close interplay science
mach defended type phenomenalism recognizing sensations real
position seemed incompatible view atoms molecules external mind-independent things
famously declared after 1897 lecture ludwig boltzmann imperial academy science vienna don't believe atoms exist! 1908 1911 mach's reluctance acknowledge reality atoms criticized max planck being incompatible physics
einstein's 1905 demonstration statistical fluctuations atoms allowed measurement their existence without direct individuated sensory evidence marked turning point acceptance atomic theory
mach's criticisms newton's position space time influenced einstein later einstein realized mach basically opposed newton's philosophy concluded physical criticism sound
1898 mach suffered cardiac arrest 1901 retired university vienna appointed upper chamber austrian parliament
leaving vienna 1913 moved son's home vaterstetten near munich continued writing corresponding until death 1916 day after 78 th birthday
current living descendant marilyn vos savant her father joseph mach
physics ernst mach’s photography bow shockwave around supersonic bullet 1888 most mach's initial studies field experimental physics concentrated interference diffraction polarization refraction light different media under external influences
there followed important explorations field supersonic fluid mechanics
mach physicist-photographer peter salcher presented their paper subject 1887 correctly describes sound effects observed during supersonic motion projectile
deduced experimentally confirmed existence shock wave conical shape projectile apex
ratio speed fluid local speed sound vp/vs now called mach number
critical parameter description high-speed fluid movement aerodynamics hydrodynamics
mach also contributed cosmology hypothesis known mach's principle
philosophy science bust mach rathauspark city hall park vienna austria 1895 1901 mach held newly created chair history philosophy inductive sciences university vienna
historico-philosophical studies mach developed phenomenalistic philosophy science became influential 19 th 20 th centuries
originally saw scientific laws summaries experimental events constructed purpose making complex data comprehensible later emphasized mathematical functions useful way describe sensory appearances
thus scientific laws while somewhat idealized describing sensations reality exists beyond sensations
“ goal physical science set itself simplest most economical abstract expression facts
human mind limited powers attempts mirror itself rich life world itself small part never hope exhaust every reason proceeding economically
reality law contains less fact itself because does reproduce fact whole aspect important us rest being intentionally necessity omitted
“ mentally separating body changeable environment moves really extricate group sensations our thoughts fastened relatively greater stability others stream our sensations
suppose attribute nature property producing like effects like circumstances just these like circumstances should know how find
nature exists once
our schematic mental imitation alone produces like events
mach's positivism also influenced many russian marxists such alexander bogdanov 1873–1928
1908 lenin philosophical work materialism empirio-criticism published 1909 criticized machism views russian machists
accordance philosophy mach opposed ludwig boltzmann others proposed atomic theory physics
since cannot observe things small atoms directly since no atomic model time consistent atomic hypothesis seemed mach unwarranted perhaps sufficiently economical
mach direct influence vienna circle philosophers school logical positivism general
mach attributed number principles distill ideal physical theorisation — now called machian physics should based entirely directly observable phenomena line positivistic leanings should completely eschew absolute space time favor relative motion any phenomena seem attributable absolute space time e
inertia centrifugal force should instead seen emerging large scale distribution matter universe
last singled out particularly albert einstein mach's principle
einstein cited three principles underlying general relativity
1930 stated justified consider mach precursor general theory relativity though mach before death reject einstein's theory
einstein aware theories fulfill mach's principles no subsequent theory either despite considerable effort
phenomenological constructivism according alexander riegler ernst mach's work precursor influential perspective known constructivism
constructivism holds knowledge constructed rather received learner
took exceptionally non-dualist phenomenological position
founder radical constructivism von glasersfeld gave nod mach ally
physiology spinning chair devised mach investigate experience motion 1873 independently each other mach physiologist physician josef breuer discovered how sense balance
perception head’s imbalance functions tracing management information brain receives movement fluid semicircular canals inner ear
sense balance depended three semicircular canals discovered 1870 physiologist friedrich goltz goltz didn't discover how balance-sensing apparatus functioned
mach devised swivel chair enable test theories floyd ratcliff suggested experiment may paved way mach's critique physical conception absolute space motion
psychology exaggerated contrast edges slightly differing shades gray appears soon touch area sensory perception psychologists remember mach optical illusion called mach bands
effect exaggerates contrast edges slightly differing shades gray soon contact another triggering edge-detection human visual system
clearly anyone before even since mach made distinction called physiological specifically visual geometrical spaces
mach's views mediating structures inspired
