interactional view watzlawick extensive research how communication effected within families
watzlawick defines five basic axioms theory communication popularly known interactional view
interactional view interpretive theory drawing cybernetic tradition
five axioms necessary order functioning communication process competence two individuals entire family
comes theory miscommunication happens because communicators “speaking same language”
happens because people different viewpoints speaking
principles cybernetic causality circular feedback nature information being core element concerned processes communication within systems widest sense—and therefore also human systems e
families large organizations even international relations
communication within interactional view based happening necessarily associated why takes place
normal well disturbed family studied order infer conditions conducive approach interaction-orientation
believed individual personality character deviance shaped individual's relations fellows
thus symptoms defenses character structure personality seen terms describing individual's typical interactions occur response particular interpersonal context
whole sum parts whole interested
five basic axioms interactional view requires network communication rules govern family homeostasis tacit collusion family members maintain status quo
even status quo negative still hard change
interactional theorists believe will fail recognize destructive resistance change unless understand watzlawick's axioms
following axioms explain how miscommunication occur communicators same page
these axioms somehow disturbed communication might fail
these axioms derived work gregory bateson much collected steps ecology mind 1972
watzlawick bavelas jackson support these axioms maintain family homeostatis
cannot communicate every behavior form communication
because behavior does counterpart there no anti-behavior impossible communicate
even communication being avoided such unconscious use non-verbals symptom strategy form communication
“symptom strategy” ascribing our silence something beyond our control makes no communication impossible
examples symptom strategy sleepiness headaches drunkenness
even facial expressions digital communication being silent analyzed communication receiver
every communication content relationship aspect such latter classifies former therefore metacommunication communication includes apart plain meaning words information
information based how speaker wants understood how himself sees relation receiver information
relationship command part message how non-verbally
content report verbally
being able interpret both these aspects essential understanding something communicator
relational aspect interaction known metacommunication
metacommunication communication communication
relationship messages most important element communication
nature relationship dependent punctuation partners communication procedures both sender receiver information structure communication flow differently therefore interpret their own behavior during communicating merely reaction other's behavior
every partner thinks other cause specific behavior
punctuate communication means interpret ongoing sequence events labeling event cause following event response
situation communication thing happens something else happens
example female relationship male feeling depressed
male relationship female feels guilty
observes situation might ask she depressed because guilt does feel guilty because her depression? human communication involves both digital analog modalities axiom refers back use non-verbals system strategy explained first axiom
mostly related digital content communication within relationship
inter-human communication procedures either symmetric complementary axiom focuses metacommunication two main components called symmetrical interchange complementary interchange
symmetrical interchange interaction based equal power communicators
accordance complementary interchange interaction based differences power
within these two interchanges there three different ways used one-up one-down one-across
one-up communication communicator attempts gain control exchange dominating overall communication
one-down communication opposite effect
communicator attempts yield control interaction submit someone
final message one-across communication
communication moves neutralize situation
also called transitory communicator attempting style
two communicators use same style one-up one-down one-across symmetrical
opposing another complementary
axiom allows us understand how interaction perceived styles communicator using
additional notions interrelated notions make up interactional view promoted watzlawick colleagues mri include cannot communicate related idea cannot influence understanding behavior constantly exchanging messages defining nature relationships part shifting focus attention intent effects behavior communication observer-imposed punctuation emphasizing vital role therapist's preconceptions bringing forth socially constructed reality investing ramifications self-fulfilling prophecy articulating fully embracing nature behavior
term used often theory interactional view enabler
enabler within addiction culture person whose non-assertive behavior allows others continue their substance abuse
example person letting their sibling continue act immature manner because family used doing
another word frequently used interactional view double-bind
someone double-bind person trapped expectations powerful party requests low-power party act symmetrically
example person asking another person why didn't you like movie? you like rock 'n' roll don't you? first person asking second person act way similar symmentrical them
criticisms critique theory centered main thing application theory whole
being able take these axioms apply them relationships families very difficult master
theory trapped because hard apply
also theory itself does claim exact applications other “reframing”
reframing asks communicators step outside situation reinterpret means
hard because theory states outside source see problem because people speaking their own language
theory also shows how relationship already changed does give practical ways go changing
system resists change hard actively use five axioms
related first axiom non-verbal communication viewed informative rather communicative
behavioral characteristic equifinality involved hard know system interactional view happening
equifinality systems theory assumption given outcome occurred due any many interconnected factors rather being result cause—effect relationship
theory rests word communication word interpreted very differently people
definitions communication very controversial
overall axioms great job explaining problems provide solutions problems bring up
critique does fail however acknowledge watzlawick's influence development brief therapy hugely important influential school psychotherapy too practical usable helping people make changes
