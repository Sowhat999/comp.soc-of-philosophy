develops mou's famous doctrine two-level ontology patterned off kantian buddhist metaphysics
treatise summum bonum 圓善論 1985
mou's last major work
mou intend final book scholars generally treat definitive summary thinking
attempts use tiantai ontological concepts inspiration find confucian solution kant's problem highest good summum bonum
includes chapter mou's commentary mencius complete evaluation place daoist buddhist philosophy modern confucian
mou's philosophy mou kant following teacher xiong shili mou zongsan sought articulate justify moral metaphysics
moral metaphysics asserts interconnectedness ontology morality implying moral value objects including self
mou’s philosophy attempts demonstrate limits kant suggesting instead ways chinese thought may surpass kantian morality
several mou’s titles directly reveal engagement kant intellectual intuition chinese philosophy phenomenon thing-in-itself treatise perfect good commitment reflected mou’s decision express philosophy kantian terms
example mou’s philosophy inherits kantian concepts autonomy intellectual intuition thing-in-itself although confucianism inspires mou transform these concepts
reason behind decision use kantian terms remains unknown scholars argue mou’s use certain terminologies aims facilitate dialogue east west pointing mou’s comparison mencius kant whereby demonstrates compatibility chinese western philosophies
mou's philosophy develops critique transformation kant’s critical philosophy
mou believes compatibility chinese thought kantian philosophy because both backed way way essentially truth different philosophies manifest different aspects
mou’s analysis kant centers kant’s critique pure reason
mou’s major criticisms kant involves kant’s regard free will theoretical
herein lies mou’s fundamental beliefs morality moral life contrary kant posits really real
presumption stems mou’s belief metaphysical necessity capability improving one’s moral praxis thus mou develops moral metaphysics within tenet subjectivism
while kant believes intellectual intuition possible god mou ascribes human beings equal capability intuition mou finds superior heidegger’s fundamental ontology
mou rejects heidegger because according kant true metaphysics transcendent
mou further departs kant’s philosophy eventually transforming commonly referred new confucianism mind confucianism
mou's moral metaphysics moral metaphysical systems proposed prior mou most notably platonic form good confucian concept dao
sense mou’s philosophy attempts reconcile these systems
concurrently mou’s philosophy influenced yogacara buddhism believes no objectivity possible aside subjectivity
mou’s beliefs regarding relationship philosophy culture view future humanity dictate construction philosophy argues necessity develop “confucian modernity”
akin view intellectual intuition mou constructs vertical philosophical system emphasizes relation subject ontological objective opposed horizontal system one’s relationship world functions through subject-object dichotomy
mou’s ontological ultimate benti ultimate reality
mou’s moral metaphysics includes natural ethical universe attempts validate morality through notion tiandao principle natural universe mou equates moral principle
further mou believes one’s uncomfortable reaction crime degeneracy indicates presence moral consciousness mou signifies inner essence human beings
belief infinite within benti similarly exists within human beings known doctrine infinite mind compared heidegger’s acceptance being-with-others feature dasein wittgenstein’s rejection private language husserl’s discussion immediacy our recognition others their mental states within lived world
subsequently mou uses 良知 liangzhi good consciousness 智的直觉 zhi de zhijue intellectual intuition identify substance system
again mou chooses translate philosophy kantian terminology
here liangzhi refers foundation essence morality
within confucianism liangzhi also means essence human beings explaining why mou writes “the substance human being same world world value world reality
mou substance independent social background
idea reflects human nature proposed mencius through example apparent innate reaction individual seeing child sitting precariously well four beginnings
here mou departs traditional confucianism defining essence individual terms modern individualism
thus regards mencius’ example very life child evokes reaction individual’s relation child
mou notes basic implications example individual’s inherent benevolence consistent autonomy moral subject
autonomy motivating force morality according mou exists within transcendental philosophical mind individual
accord notions intellectual intuition mou committed idea moral transformation whereby individuals transcend themselves ultimately become sages
mou borrows conception moral transformation confucianism well concept summum bonum there exists connection one’s worthiness happiness actual attainment happiness
discussion criticism mou’s philosophy several consequences arise mou’s moral metaphysics
scholars view mou defender zen buddhism over other critical buddhisms pointing mou’s morality similar zen buddhism maintains possibility enlightenment important actually attaining
additionally ascribing human beings intellectual intuition ultimately assigns humans moral responsibility
however allows individuals access kant’s noumenon
according mou intellectual intuition human beings foundation chinese thought
phenomena noumena mou zongsan writes “if true human beings cannot intellectual intuition then whole chinese philosophy must collapse completely”
despite fact mou’s claim many scholars debate validity maintaining legitimacy chinese philosophy new confucianism independent intellectual intuition
traditional confucians reject mou citing wholesale acceptance western liberty democracy problematic
despite mou’s attempt confucian modernity critics claim new confucianism cannot handle modernity’s interconnectedness inevitable negative consequences
others argue because mou political should even considered confucian because much confucian doctrine advocates active pursuit change
however limitations speech china during time period mou philosophized may address criticism
