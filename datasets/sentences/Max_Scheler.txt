1927 conference darmstadt near frankfurt arranged hermann keyserling scheler delivered lengthy lecture entitled 'man's particular place' die sonderstellung des menschen published later much abbreviated form die stellung des menschen im kosmos [literally 'man's position cosmos']
well known oratorical style delivery captivated audience four hours

however advice physician cancel reservations already made star line
time scheler increasingly focused political development

'politics morals' 'the idea eternal peace pacifism' subjects talks delivered berlin 1927

max weber very mind-set however argued scheler origin modern subconscious angst expressed increasing needs financial other securities protection personal safeguards well rational manageability entities
however subordination value individual person mind-set sufficient reason max scheler denounce outline predict whole new era culture values called 'the world-era adjustment'
scheler also advocated international university set up switzerland time supportive programs such 'continuing education' seems first call 'united states europe'
deplored gap existing germany power mind gap regarded very source impending dictatorship greatest obstacle establishment german democracy
five years after death nazi dictatorship 1933–1945 suppressed scheler's work
philosophical contributions love phenomenological attitude editors geisteswissenschaften invited scheler 1913/14 write then developing philosophical method phenomenology scheler indicated reservation concerning task because report own viewpoint phenomenology there no phenomenological school defined universally accepted theses
there circle philosophers bound common bearing attitude toward philosophical problems
scheler never agreed husserl phenomenology method strict sense rather attitude spiritual seeing
something otherwise remains hidden
calling phenomenology method fails take seriously phenomenological domain original experience givenness phenomenological facts essences values priori before fixed logic prior assuming set criteria symbols case empirical human sciences well other modern philosophies tailor their methods those sciences
rather given phenomenology given seeing experiencing act itself
essences never given 'outside' observer no direct contact thing itself
phenomenology engagement phenomena while simultaneously waiting self-givenness methodical procedure observation object stationary
thus particular attitude geisteshaltung lit
disposition spirit spiritual posture philosopher crucial disclosure seeing phenomenological facts
attitude fundamentally moral strength philosophical inquiry rests upon basis love
scheler describes essence philosophical thinking love-determined movement inmost personal self finite being toward participation essential reality possibles
movement act love important philosophy two reasons philosophy scheler describes hearkening back platonic tradition participation primal essence essences urwesen follows participation achieved must incorporate within oneself content essential characteristic primal essence
scheler such primal essence most characterized according love thus way achieve most direct intimate participation precisely share movement love
important mention however primal essence objectifiable entity whose possible correlate knowledge thus even philosophy concerned knowing scheler concur nevertheless reason itself proper participative faculty greatest level knowing achieved
reason logic behind them movement love proper moral preconditions achieve philosophical knowledge
2 love likewise important insofar essence condition possibility givenness value-objects especially givenness object terms highest possible value
love movement brings continuous emergence ever-higher value object--just streaming out object own accord without any sort exertion
part lover
true love opens our spiritual eyes ever-higher values object loved
hatred other hand closing off oneself closing ones eyes world values
latter context value-inversions devaluations become prevalent sometimes solidified proper societies
furthermore calling love movement scheler hopes dispel interpretation love hate reactions felt values rather very ground possibility value-givenness value-concealment
scheler writes love hate acts value-realm accessible feelings being
either extended narrowed
love hate distinguished sensible even psychical feelings instead characterized intentional function loves hates something therefore must belong same anthropological sphere theoretical consciousness acts willing thinking
scheler therefore calls love hate spiritual feelings basis emotive priori insofar values through love given same manner essences through cognition
short love value-cognition insofar determinative way philosopher approaches world also indicative phenomenological attitude
material value-ethics fundamental aspect scheler's phenomenology extension realm priori include formal propositions material ones well
kant's identification priori formal fundamental error basis ethical formalism
furthermore kant erroneously identified realm non-formal material sensible empirical content
heart scheler's criticism kant within theory values
values given priori feelable phenomena
intentional feeling love discloses values insofar love opens person evermore beings-of-value wertsein
additionally values formal realities exist somewhere apart world their bearers exist value-bearer value-being
therefore part realm material priori
nevertheless values vary respect their bearers without there ever occurring alteration object bearer
value specific work art specific religious articles may vary according differences culture religion
however variation values respect their bearers no means amounts relativity values such respect particular value-bearer
such values culture spiritual irrespective objects may bear value values holy still remain highest values regardless their bearers
according scheler disclosure value-being object precedes representation
axiological reality values given prior knowing upon being felt through value-feeling known their essential interconnections
values their corresponding disvalues ranked according their essential interconnections follows values holy vs
disvalues unholy values spirit truth beauty vs
disvalues their opposites values life noble vs
disvalues vulgar values pleasure vs
disvalues pain values utility vs
disvalues useless
further essential interconnections apply respect value's disvalue's existence non-existence existence positive value itself positive value
existence negative value disvalue itself negative value
non-existence positive value itself negative value
non-existence negative value itself positive value
respect values good evil good value attached realization positive value sphere willing
evil value attached realization negative value sphere willing
good value attached realization higher value sphere willing
evil value attached realization lower value [at expense higher one] sphere willing
goodness however simply attached act willing originates ultimately within disposition gesinnung basic moral tenor acting person
accordingly criterion 'good' consists agreement value intended realization value preferred disagreement value rejected
criterion 'evil' consists disagreement value intended realization value preferred agreement value rejected
scheler argued most older ethical systems kantian formalism theonomic ethics nietzscheanism hedonism consequentialism platonism example fall axiological error emphasizing value-rank exclusion others
novel aspect scheler's ethics importance kairos call hour
moral rules cannot guide person make ethical choices difficult existential life-choices
scheler very capacity obey rules rooted basic moral tenor person
disorder heart occurs whenever person prefers value lower rank higher rank disvalue value
term wertsein value-being used scheler many contexts untimely death prevented working out axiological ontology
another unique controversial element scheler's axiology notion emotive priori values felt just color seen
reason cannot think values mind order categories value after lived experience happened
scheler person locus value-experience timeless act-being acts time
scheler's appropriation value-based metaphysics renders phenomenology quite different phenomenology consciousness husserl sartre existential analysis being-in-the-world dasein heidegger
scheler's concept lived body appropriated early work maurice merleau-ponty
max scheler extended phenomenological method include reduction scientific method too thus questioning idea husserl phenomenological philosophy should pursued rigorous science
natural scientific attitudes einstellung both phenomenologically counterpositive hence must sublated advancement real phenomenological reduction eyes scheler shapes allround ascesis askese rather mere logical procedure suspending existential judgments

fragments such work published nachlass
1924 man history mensch und geschichte scheler gave preliminary statements range goal philosophical anthropology
book scheler argues tabula rasa inherited prejudices three main traditions formulated idea man religion philosophy science
scheler argues enough just reject such traditions nietzsche judeo-christian religion saying god dead these traditions impregnated parts our culture therefore still determine great deal way thinking even those don't believe christian god
really get freedom such traditions necessary study deconstruct them husserl's term abbau
scheler says philosophical anthropology must address totality man while must informed specialized sciences like biology psychology sociology

there confusion concerning whether scheler ranks pleasure agreeable higher utility vice versa
confusion started manfred frings' interpretation lists utility higher value sensible values such comfort discomfort
frings mind max scheler 29-30
seems frings derives interpretation scheler's stratification feelings sensible feelings lowest type
however scheler's list rank values formalism consistent stratification feeling insofar there scheler does even list utility values their own place rank utility self-value consecutive value founded upon self-value agreeable
'useful' consecutive value regard self-value agreeable 104
scheler's book ressentiment however provides even clearer statement frings mistaken interpretation scheler's value-rank
here again notes called useful derived pleasure basic value
course basic does mean lowest
scheler's meaning clear true enjoyment should subordinated higher values such vital values spiritual values culture 'sacredness
subordinating utility absurdity subordination end means
nevertheless become rule modern morality useful work better enjoyment pleasure
here again propelling motive hard-working modern utilitarian ressentiment against superior capacity art enjoyment
