protrepticus main article protrepticus clement orphic mysteries used example false cults greek paganism protrepticus
protrepticus title suggests exhortation pagans greece adopt christianity within clement demonstrates extensive knowledge pagan mythology theology
chiefly important due clement's exposition religion anthropological phenomenon
after short philosophical discussion opens history greek religion seven stages
clement suggests first men mistakenly believed sun moon other heavenly bodies gods
next development worship products agriculture contends cults demeter dionysus arose
man then paid reverence revenge deified human feelings love fear among others
following stage poets hesiod homer attempt enumerate gods hesiod's theogony giving number twelve
finally men proclaimed other men such asclepius heracles deities
discussing idolatry clement contends objects primitive religion unshaped wood stone idols thus arose such natural items carved
following plato clement critical forms visual art suggesting artworks illusions deadly toys
clement criticizes greek paganism protrepticus basis deities both false poor moral examples attacks mystery religions their obscurantism trivial rituals
particular worshippers dionysus ridiculed their ritual use children's toys
suggests points pagan deities based humans others misanthropic demons cites several classical sources support second hypothesis
clement like many pre-nicene fathers writes favourably euhemerus other rationalist philosophers grounds least saw flaws paganism
however greatest praise reserved plato whose apophatic views god prefigure christianity
figure orpheus prominent throughout narrative clement contrasts song representing pagan superstition divine logos christ
according clement through conversion christianity alone man fully participate logos universal truth
paedagogus main article paedagogus christ logos incarnate paedagogus work's title
work's title translatable tutor refers christ teacher mankind features extended metaphor christians children
simply instructional author intends show how christian should respond love god authentically
clement following plato republic 4441 divides life three elements character actions passions
first having dealt protrepticus devotes paedagogus reflections christ's role teaching us act morally control our passions
despite explicitly christian nature clement's work draws stoic philosophy pagan literature homer alone cited over sixty times work
although christ like man made image god alone shares likeness god father
christ both sinless apathetic thus striving imitate christ man achieve salvation
clement sin involuntary thus irrational [αλόγον] removed through wisdom logos
god's guidance us away sin thus manifestation god's universal love mankind
word play λόγος αλόγον characteristic clement's writing may rooted epicurean belief relationships words deeply reflective relationships objects signify
clement argues equality sexes grounds salvation extended mankind equally
unusually suggests christ neither male female god father both male female aspects eucharist described milk breast christ father
supportive women playing active role leadership church provides list women considers inspirational includes both biblical classical greek figures
suggested clement's progressive views gender set out paedagogus influenced gnosticism
however later work argues against gnostics faith esoteric knowledge [γνῶσις] required salvation
according clement through faith christ enlightened come know god
second book clement provides practical rules living christian life
argues against overindulgence food favour good table manners
while prohibiting drunkenness promotes drinking alcohol moderation following timothy 523
clement argues simple way life accordance innate simplicity christian monotheism
condemns elaborate expensive furnishings clothing argues against overly passionate music perfumes
clement does believe abandoning worldly pleasures argues christian should able express joy god's creation through gaiety partying
opposes wearing garlands because picking flowers ultimately kills beautiful creation god garland resembles crown thorns
clement treats sex length
argues both promiscuity sexual abstinence unnatural main goal human sexuality procreation
homosexuality prostitution concubinage adultery coitus pregnant women should avoided will act towards generation legitimate offspring
third book continues along similar vein condemning cosmetics grounds our souls our bodies should seek beautify
clement also opposes dyeing men's hair male depilation effeminacy
advises choosing one's company carefully avoid being corrupted immoral people while arguing material wealth no sin itself too likely distract infinitely important spiritual wealth found christ
work finishes selections scripture supporting clement's argument following prayer lyrics hymn
stromata clement describes stromata work various subjects spring up text like flowers meadow
main article stromata contents stromata title suggests miscellaneous
place trilogy disputed clement initially intended write didasculus work complement practical guidance paedagogus intellectual schooling theology
stromata less systematic ordered clement's other works theorized andré méhat intended limited esoteric readership
although eusebius eight books work seven undoubtably survive
photius writing 9 th century found various text appended manuscripts seven canonical books lead daniel heinsius suggest original eighth book lost identified text purported eighth book fragments hypopotoses
first book starts topic greek philosophy
consistent other writing clement affirms philosophy propaedeutic role greek similar function law jews
then embarks discussion origins greek culture technology arguing most important figures greek world foreigners erroneously jewish culture most significant influence greece
attempt demonstrate primacy moses clement gives extended chronology world wherein dates birth christ 25 april may 4-2
creation world 5592
books ends discussion origin languages possibility jewish influence plato
second book largely devoted respective roles faith philosophical argument
clement contends while both important fear god foremost because through faith receives divine wisdom
clement scripture innately true primitive philosophy complemented human reason through logos
faith voluntary decision believe crucial fundamental step becoming closer god
never irrational founded knowledge truth logos knowledge proceeds faith first principles unprovable outside systematic structure
third book covers asceticism
discusses marriage treated similarly paedagogus
clement rejects gnostic opposition marriage arguing men uninterested women should remain celibate sex positive good performed within marriage purposes procreation
however fall occurred because adam eve succumbed their desire each other copulated before allotted time
argues against idea christians should reject their family ascetic life stems luke 1425–27 contending jesus contradicted precept honour thy father thy mother exodus ten commandments
clement concludes asceticism will rewarded motivation christian nature thus asceticism non-christians such gymnosophists pointless
clement begins fourth book belated explanation disorganized nature work gives brief description aims remaining three four books
fourth book focuses martyrdom
while good christians should unafraid death clement condemns those actively seek out martyr's death arguing sufficient respect god's gift life
ambivalent whether any believing christian become martyr virtue manner their death whether martyrdom reserved those lived exceptional lives
marcionites cannot become martyrs because believe divinity god father their sufferings vain
there then digression subject theological epistemology
according clement there no way empirically testing existence god father because logos revelatory analysable meaning although christ object senses
god no beginning universal first principle
fifth book returns subject faith
clement argues truth justice goodness seen mind eye faith way accessing unseeable
stresses knowledge god achieved through faith once ones moral faults corrected
parallels clement's earlier insistence martyrdom achieved those practice their faith christ through good deeds those simply profess their faith
god transcends matter entirely thus materialist cannot truly come know god
although christ god incarnate our spiritual physical comprehension important
beginning sixth book clement intends demonstrate works greek poets derived prophetic books bible
order reinforce position greeks inclined towards plagiarism cites numerous instances such inappropriate appropriation classical greek writers reported second-hand plagiarism anonymous 3 rd century bc work sometimes ascribed aretades
clement then digresses subject sin hell arguing adam perfect created given potential achieve perfection
espouses broadly universalist doctrine holding christ's promise salvation available even those condemned hell
final extant book begins description nature christ true christian aims similar possible both father son
clement then criticizes simplistic anthropomorphism most ancient religions quoting xenophanes' famous description african thracian egyptian deities
greek gods may also their origins personification material objects ares representing iron dionysus wine
prayer relationship love knowledge then discussed
corinthians 138 seems contradict characterization true christian knows clement knowledge vanishes subsumed universal love expressed christian reverence creator
following socrates argues vice arises state ignorance intention
christian labourer god's vineyard responsible both own path salvation neighbor
work ends extended passage against contemporary divisions heresies within church
other works besides great trilogy clement's other extant work treatise salvation rich also known rich man saved?
having begun scathing criticism corrupting effects money misguided servile attitudes towards wealthy clement discusses implications mark 1025
rich either unconvinced promise eternal life unaware conflict possession material spiritual wealth good christian duty guide them towards better life through gospel
jesus' words taken literally should seek supercelestial [ὑπερουράνιος] meaning true route salvation revealed
holding material wealth itself wrong long used charitably men should careful let their wealth dominate their spirit
important give up sinful passions external wealth
rich man saved must follow two commandments while material wealth no value god used alleviate suffering our neighbor
other known works exist fragments alone including four eschatological works secret tradition hypotyposes excerpta ex theodoto eclogae propheticae adumbraetiones
these cover clement's celestial hierarchy complex schema universe headed face god below lie seven protoctists followed archangels angels humans
according jean daniélou schema inherited judaeo-christian esotericism followed apostles imparted orally those christians trusted such mysteries
proctocists first beings created god act priests archangels
clement identifies them both eyes lord thrones
clement characterizes celestial forms entirely different anything earthly although argues members each order seem incorporal those lower orders
according eclogae propheticae every thousand years every member each order moves up degree thus men become angels
even protoctists elevated although their new position hierarchy clearly defined
apparent contradiction fact there seven protoctists also vast number archangels promoted their order problematic
commonest modern explanation number seven meant taken literally principally numerological significance
know titles several lost works because list eusebius' ecclesiastical history 6
include outlines eight books against judaizers
others known mentions clement's own writings including marriage prophecy although few attested other writers difficult separate works intended write those actually completed
mar saba letter attributed clement morton smith there remains much debate today over whether authentic letter clement ancient pseudepigraph modern forgery
authentic main significance relating apostle mark came alexandria rome there spiritual gospel entrusted church alexandria death genuine letter pushes back tradition related eusebius connecting mark alexandria century
legacy eusebius first writer provide account clement's life works church history
there two separate sections work dedicated clement 5
latter seems decidedly out place valesius argued evidence eusebius never revised work
eusebius provides list clement's works biographical information extended quotation stromata
photios constantinople writes against clement's theology bibliotheca although appreciative clement's learning literary merits work
particular highly critical hypotyposes work biblical exegesis few fragments survived
photius compared clement's treatise like other works highly syncretic featuring ideas hellenistic jewish gnostic origin unfavourably against prevailing orthodoxy 9 th century
among particular ideas photius deemed heretical belief matter thought eternal thus originate god contradicting doctrine creatio ex nihilo
belief cosmic cycles predating creation world following heraclitus extra-biblical origin
belief christ logos sense created contrary john following philo
ambivalence towards docetism heretical doctrine christ's earthly body illusion
belief eve created adam's sperm after ejaculated during night
belief genesis 62 implies angels indulged coitus human women
orthodox catholic theology angels considered sexless
down seventeenth century venerated saint catholicism
name found martyrologies feast fell fourth december
roman martyrology revised pope clement viii name dropped calendar advice cardinal baronius
benedict maintained decision predecessor grounds clement's life little known never obtained public cultus church doctrines erroneous least suspect
thus clement revered saint contemporary roman catholicism nor considered saint much eastern orthodox christianity
clement's veneration somewhat limited commemorated nonetheless anglicanism
well universal catholic church's cathedral dallas dedicated
earliest church fathers whose works survived subject significant amount recent academic work mainly focusing relationship thought non-christian philosophy influence origen
