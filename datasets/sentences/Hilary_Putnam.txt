despite these changes view throughout career remained committed scientific realism roughly view mature scientific theories approximately true descriptions ways things
philosophy perception putnam came endorse direct realism according perceptual experiences directly present external world
past further held there no mental representations sense data other intermediaries stand mind world
however rejected further commitment favor transactionalism view accepts both perceptual experiences world-involving transactions these transactions functionally describable provided worldly items intentional states may referred specification function
such transactions further involve qualia

philosophy mind multiple realizability illustration multiple realizability
m stands mental p stands physical
seen p instantiate m vice versa
causal relations states represented arrows m1 goes m2 etc
putnam's best-known work concerns philosophy mind
most noted original contributions field came several key papers published late 1960 s set out hypothesis multiple realizability
these papers putnam argues contrary famous claim type-identity theory necessarily true pain identical c-fibre firing
pain according putnam's papers may correspond utterly different physical states nervous system different organisms yet experience same mental state being pain
putnam cited examples animal kingdom illustrate thesis
asked whether likely brain structures diverse types animals realize pain other mental states same way
share same brain structures cannot share same mental states properties
answer puzzle mental states realized different physical states different species
putnam then took argument step further asking such things nervous systems alien beings artificially intelligent robots other silicon-based life forms
these hypothetical entities contended should considered incapable experiencing pain just because lack same neurochemistry humans
putnam concluded type-identity theorists making ambitious highly implausible conjecture disproven example multiple realizability
argument sometimes referred likelihood argument
putnam formulated complementary argument based called functional isomorphism
defined concept these terms two systems functionally isomorphic 'there correspondence states states other preserves functional relations'
case computers two machines functionally isomorphic sequential relations among states first exactly mirrored sequential relations among states other
therefore computer made out silicon chips computer made out cogs wheels functionally isomorphic constitutionally diverse
functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability
argument sometimes referred priori argument
jerry fodor putnam others noted along being effective argument against type-identity theories multiple realizability implies any low-level explanation higher-level mental phenomena insufficiently abstract general
functionalism identifies mental kinds functional kinds characterized exclusively terms causes effects abstracts level microphysics therefore seemed better explanation relation mind body
fact there many functional kinds such mousetraps software bookshelves multiply realized physical level
machine state functionalism turing machine visualized finite-length tape slots however made before run arbitrarily longer needed written erased time choice action determined state
according putnam's machine-state functionalism notions state abstract computer mental state essentially same
first formulation such functionalist theory put forth putnam himself
formulation now called machine-state functionalism inspired analogies noted putnam others mind theoretical turing machines capable computing any given algorithm
non-technical terms turing machine visualized infinitely long tape divided squares memory box-shaped scanning device sits over scans square memory time
each square either blank written
these inputs machine
possible outputs halt nothing
r move square right
l move square left
erase whatever square
erase whatever square print
simple example turing machine writes out sequence '111' after scanning three blank squares then stopping specified following machine table state state 2 state 3 write stay state write stay state 2 write stay state 3 go right go state 2 go right go state 3 [halt] table states machine state scans blank square will print remain state
state reads will move square right also go state two
state two reads will print stay state two
it's state two reads will move square right go state three
finally state three reads prints remains state three
point functionalism nature states turing machine
each state defined terms relations other states inputs outputs
state example simply state machine reads writes stays state reads moves square right goes different state
functional definition state causal role overall system
details how accomplishes accomplishes material constitution completely irrelevant
according machine-state functionalism nature mental state just like nature automaton states described above
just state simply state given input such-and-such happens being pain state disposes cry ouch become distracted wonder cause forth
rejection functionalism late 1980 s putnam abandoned adherence functionalism other computational theories mind
change mind primarily due difficulties computational theories explaining certain intuitions respect externalism mental content
illustrated putnam's own twin earth thought experiment see philosophy language
also developed separate argument against functionalism 1988 based fodor's generalized version multiple realizability
asserting functionalism really watered-down identity theory mental kinds identified functional kinds putnam argued mental kinds may multiply realizable over functional kinds
argument functionalism same mental state implemented different states universal turing machine
despite putnam's rejection functionalism continued flourish developed numerous versions thinkers diverse david marr daniel dennett jerry fodor david lewis
functionalism helped lay foundations modern cognitive science dominant theory mind philosophy today
putnam accepted modification functionalism called liberal functionalism
view holds matters consciousness mental properties generally right sort functional capacities particular matter subserves those capacities
specification these capacities may refer goes outside organism's brain 2 may include intentional idioms 3 need describe capacity compute something other
philosophy language semantic externalism putnam's contributions philosophy language claim meaning just ain't head
illustrated using twin earth thought experiment argue environmental factors play substantial role determining meaning
twin earth shows according putnam since twin earth everything identical earth except lakes rivers oceans filled xyz whereas those earth filled h2 o
consequently earthling fredrick uses earth-english word water different meaning twin earth-english word water used physically identical twin frodrick twin earth
since fredrick frodrick physically indistinguishable utter their respective words since their words different meanings meaning cannot determined solely their heads
led putnam adopt version semantic externalism regard meaning mental content
late philosopher mind language donald davidson despite many differences opinion putnam semantic externalism constituted anti-subjectivist revolution philosophers' way seeing world
since time descartes philosophers concerned proving knowledge basis subjective experience
thanks putnam tyler burge others davidson philosophy now take objective realm granted start questioning alleged truths subjective experience
theory meaning putnam along saul kripke keith donnellan others contributed known causal theory reference
particular putnam maintained meaning meaning objects referred natural kind terms—such tiger water tree—are principal elements meaning such terms
there linguistic division labor analogous adam smith's economic division labor according such terms their references fixed experts particular field science terms belong
example reference term lion fixed community zoologists reference term elm tree fixed community botanists reference term table salt fixed na cl chemists
these referents considered rigid designators kripkean sense disseminated outward linguistic community
putnam specifies finite sequence elements vector description meaning every term language
such vector consists four components object term refers e
object individuated chemical formula h2 o set typical descriptions term referred stereotype e
transparent colorless hydrating semantic indicators place object general category e
natural kind liquid syntactic indicators e
concrete noun mass noun
such meaning-vector provides description reference use expression within particular linguistic community
provides conditions correct usage makes possible judge whether single speaker attributes appropriate meaning expression whether use changed enough cause difference meaning
according putnam legitimate speak change meaning expression reference term stereotype changed
however since there no possible algorithm determine aspect—the stereotype reference—has changed particular case necessary consider usage other expressions language
since there no limit number such expressions must considered putnam embraced form semantic holism
philosophy mathematics putnam made significant contribution philosophy mathematics quine–putnam indispensability argument mathematical realism
argument considered stephen yablo most challenging arguments favor acceptance existence abstract mathematical entities such numbers sets
form argument follows
must ontological commitments entities indispensable best scientific theories those entities commonly referred
mathematical entities indispensable best scientific theories
therefore must ontological commitments mathematical entities
justification first premise most controversial
both putnam quine invoke naturalism justify exclusion non-scientific entities hence defend part
assertion entities postulated scientific theories including numbers should accepted real justified confirmation holism
since theories confirmed piecemeal fashion whole there no justification excluding any entities referred well-confirmed theories
puts nominalist wishes exclude existence sets non-euclidean geometry include existence quarks other undetectable entities physics example difficult position
putnam holds view mathematics like physics other empirical sciences uses both strict logical proofs quasi-empirical methods
example fermat's last theorem states no integer there positive integer values x z such
before proven 1995 andrew wiles proven many values n
these proofs inspired further research area formed quasi-empirical consensus theorem
even though such knowledge conjectural strictly proven theorem still used developing other mathematical ideas
mathematics computer science putnam contributed scientific fields directly related work philosophy
mathematician putnam contributed resolution hilbert's tenth problem mathematics
problem settled yuri matiyasevich 1970 proof relied heavily previous research putnam julia robinson martin davis
computability theory putnam investigated structure ramified analytical hierarchy connection constructible hierarchy turing degrees
showed there exist many levels constructible hierarchy add any subsets integers later student george boolos first such non-index ordinal ramified analysis smallest such model full second-order comprehension also together separate paper richard boyd another putnam's students gustav hensel how davis–mostowski–kleene hyperarithmetical hierarchy arithmetical degrees naturally extended up
computer science putnam known davis–putnam algorithm boolean satisfiability problem sat developed martin davis 1960
algorithm finds there set true false values satisfies given boolean expression entire expression becomes true
1962 further refined algorithm help george logemann donald w
became known dpll algorithm
algorithm efficient still forms basis most complete sat solvers
epistemology brain vat—putnam uses thought experiment argue skeptical scenarios impossible
field epistemology putnam known brain vat thought experiment modernized version descartes' evil demon hypothesis
argument cannot coherently state disembodied brain vat placed there mad scientist
follows causal theory reference
words refer kinds things coined refer thus kinds things their user user's ancestors experienced
person mary brain vat whose every experience received through wiring other gadgetry created mad scientist then mary's idea brain refer real brain since she her linguistic community never seen such thing
rather she saw something looked like brain actually image fed her through wiring
similarly her idea vat refer real vat
brain vat she say i'm brain vat she actually saying i'm brain-image vat-image incoherent
other hand she brain vat then saying she brain vat still incoherent now because she actually means opposite
form epistemological externalism knowledge justification depends factors outside mind solely determined internally
putnam clarified real target argument never skepticism metaphysical realism
since realism kind assumes existence gap how man conceives world way world really skeptical scenarios such descartes' evil demon present formidable challenge
putnam arguing such scenario impossible attempts show notion gap man's concept world way itself absurd
man cannot god's eye view reality
limited conceptual schemes
metaphysical realism therefore false according putnam
metaphilosophy ontology late 1970 s 1980 s stimulated results mathematical logic ideas quine putnam abandoned long-standing defence metaphysical realism—the view categories structures external world both causally ontologically independent conceptualizations human mind
adopted rather different view called internal realism
internal realism view although world may causally independent human mind structure world—its division kinds individuals categories—is function human mind hence world ontologically independent
general idea influenced kant's idea dependence our knowledge world categories thought
problem metaphysical realism according putnam fails explain possibility reference truth
according metaphysical realist our concepts categories refer because match up mysterious manner pre-structured categories kinds individuals inherent external world
how possible world carves up certain structures categories mind carves up world own categories structures two carvings perfectly coincide? answer must world does come pre-structured structure must imposed human mind conceptual schemes
reason truth history putnam identified truth termed idealized rational acceptability
theory owes something c
peirce belief true accepted anyone under ideal epistemic conditions
nelson goodman formulated similar notion fact fiction forecast 1956
work goodman went far suggest there no world many worlds each created human mind
putnam rejected form social constructivism retained idea there many correct descriptions reality
no these descriptions scientifically proven true description world
does imply relativism putnam because descriptions equally correct ones correct determined subjectively
putnam renounced internal realism reply simon blackburn volume reading putnam
reasons gave up antirealism stated first three replies philosophy hilary putnam issue journal philosophical topics gives history uses term internal realism length threefold cord mind body world 1999
although abandoned internal realism putnam still resists idea any given thing system things described exactly complete correct way
thus accepts conceptual relativity view may matter choice convention e
whether mereological sums exist whether space-time points individuals mere limits
other words having abandoned internal realism putnam came accept metaphysical realism simply broad sense rejecting forms verificationism talk our 'making' world
under influence c
peirce william james putnam also became convinced there no fact–value dichotomy normative e
ethical aesthetic judgments often factual basis while scientific judgments normative element
neopragmatism wittgenstein end 1980 s putnam became increasingly disillusioned perceived scientism rejection history characterize modern analytic philosophy
rejected internal realism because assumed cognitive interface model relation mind world
putnam claimed very notion truth abandoned consistent eliminative materialist
under increasing influence james pragmatists adopted direct realist view relation
time under influence ludwig wittgenstein adopted pluralist view philosophy itself came view most philosophical problems nothing conceptual linguistic confusions created philosophers using ordinary language out original context
many putnam's most recent works addressed concerns ordinary people particularly their concerns social problems
example written nature democracy social justice religion
discussed ideas continental philosopher jürgen habermas written articles influenced continental ideas
death putnam died mesothelioma rare form lung cancer home arlington massachusetts during early hours march 13 2016
criticism putnam himself may own most formidable philosophical adversary
frequent changes mind led attack previous positions
however many significant criticisms views come other philosophers scientists
example multiple realizability criticized grounds true research experimentation neurosciences impossible
according bechtel mundale able conduct such research neurosciences universal consistencies must either exist assumed exist brain structures
similarity homology brain structures allows us generalize across species
multiple realizability empirical fact results experiments conducted species animal organism meaningful generalized explain behavior another species organism same species
other criticisms metaphysical realism proposed jaegwon kim david lewis robert richardson patricia churchland
main arguments against functionalism formulated putnam himself twin earth thought experiment
however there other criticisms
chinese room argument john searle 1980 direct attack claim thought represented set functions
thought experiment designed show possible mimic intelligent action without any interpretation understanding through use purely functional system
short searle describes situation person speaks english locked room chinese symbols baskets rule book english moving symbols around
person instructed people outside room follow rule book sending certain symbols out room given certain symbols
further suppose people outside room chinese speakers communicating person inside via chinese symbols
according searle absurd claim english speaker inside knows chinese based these syntactic processes alone
thought experiment attempts show systems operate merely syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics meaning intentionality aboutness
thus searle attacks idea thought equated following set syntactic rules
thus functionalism inadequate theory mind
several other arguments against functionalism advanced ned block
putnam consistently adhered idea semantic holism spite many changes other positions
problems position described michael dummett jerry fodor ernest lepore others
first place suggest semantic holism true impossible understand how speaker language learn meaning expression any expression language
given limits our cognitive abilities will never able master whole english any other language even based false assumption languages static immutable entities
thus must understand natural language understand single word expression language learning simply impossible
semantic holism also fails explain how two speakers mean same thing using same linguistic expression therefore how any communication possible them
given sentence p since fred mary each mastered different parts english language p related different ways sentences each part result p means thing fred something else mary
moreover sentence p derives meaning relations sentences language soon vocabulary individual changes addition elimination sentence totality relations changes therefore also meaning p
common phenomenon result p two different meanings two different moments life same person
consequently accept truth sentence then reject later meaning rejected accepted completely different therefore cannot change my opinions regard same sentences
brain vat argument also subject criticism
crispin wright argues putnam's formulation brain-in-a-vat scenario too narrow refute global skepticism
possibility recently disembodied brain vat undermined semantic externalism
person lived her entire life outside vat—speaking english language interacting normally outside world—prior her envatment mad scientist she wakes up inside vat her words thoughts e
tree grass will still refer objects events external world referred before her envatment
another scenario brain vat may hooked up supercomputer randomly generates perceptual experiences
case one's words thoughts refer anything therefore devoid content
semantics no longer exist argument meaningless
philosophy mathematics stephen yablo argued quine–putnam indispensability thesis does demonstrate mathematical entities truly indispensable
argumentation sophisticated upshot achieve same logical results simply adding any statement abstract object assumption so-and-so assumed hypothesized exist
example take argument indispensability described above adjust follows 1*
must ontological commitments [abstract] entities under assumption exist their existence indispensable best scientific theories
under assumption exist existence mathematical entities indispensable best scientific theories
therefore 3*
under assumption mathematical entities exist must ontological commitments existence mathematical entities
finally putnam's internal realism accused curtis brown being disguised form subjective idealism
case subject traditional arguments against position
particular falls trap solipsism
existence depends experience subjective idealism maintains one's consciousness stop existing then rest universe stop existing well
