political career lu state headed ruling ducal house
under duke three aristocratic families whose heads bore title viscount held hereditary positions lu bureaucracy
ji family held position minister over masses also prime minister meng family held position minister works shu family held position minister war
winter 505 bc yang hu—a retainer ji family—rose up rebellion seized power ji family
however summer 501 bc three hereditary families succeeded expelling yang hu lu
then confucius built up considerable reputation through teachings while families came see value proper conduct righteousness achieve loyalty legitimate government
thus year 501 bc confucius came appointed minor position governor town
eventually rose position minister crime
confucius desired return authority state duke dismantling fortifications city-strongholds belonging three families
way establish centralized government
however confucius relied solely diplomacy no military authority himself
500 bc hou fan—the governor hou—revolted against lord shu family
although meng shu families unsuccessfully besieged hou loyalist official rose up people hou forced hou fan flee qi state
situation may favor confucius likely made possible confucius disciples convince aristocratic families dismantle fortifications their cities
eventually after year half confucius disciples succeeded convincing shu family raze walls hou ji family razing walls bi meng family razing walls cheng
first shu family led army towards their city hou tore down walls 498 bc
soon thereafter gongshan furao[a]—a retainer ji family—revolted took control forces bi
immediately launched attack entered capital lu
earlier gongshan approached confucius join confucius considered
even though disapproved use violent revolution ji family dominated lu state force generations exiled previous duke
although wanted opportunity put principles practice confucius gave up idea end
creel 1949 states unlike rebel yang hu before gongshan may sought destroy three hereditary families restore power duke
however dubs 1946 view gongshan encouraged viscount ji huan invade lu capital attempt avoid dismantling bi fortified walls
whatever situation may gongshan considered upright man continued defend state lu even after forced flee
during revolt gongshan zhong you 仲由 managed keep duke three viscounts together court
zhong you disciples confucius confucius arranged given position governor ji family
confucius heard raid requested viscount ji huan allow duke court retreat stronghold palace grounds
thereafter heads three families duke retreated ji's palace complex ascended wuzi terrace
confucius ordered two officers lead assault against rebels
least two officers retainer ji family unable refuse orders while presence duke viscounts court
rebels pursued defeated gu
immediately after revolt defeated ji family razed bi city walls ground
attackers retreated after realizing become rebels against state against their own lord
through confucius' actions bi officials inadvertently revolted against their own lord thus forcing viscount ji huan's hand having dismantle walls bi harbored such rebels confess instigating event going against proper conduct righteousness official
dubs 1949 suggests incident brought light confucius' foresight practical political ability insight human character
time dismantle city walls meng family governor reluctant city walls torn down convinced head meng family
zuo zhuan recalls governor advised against razing walls ground made cheng vulnerable qi state cause destruction meng family
even though viscount meng yi gave word interfere attempt went back earlier promise dismantle walls
later 498 bc duke ding personally went army lay siege cheng attempt raze walls ground succeed
thus confucius achieve idealistic reforms wanted including restoration legitimate rule duke
made powerful enemies within state especially viscount ji huan due successes far
according accounts zuo zhuan shiji confucius departed homeland 497 bc after support failed attempt dismantling fortified city walls powerful ji meng shu families
left state lu without resigning remaining self-exile unable return long viscount ji huan alive
exile shiji states neighboring qi state worried lu becoming too powerful while confucius involved government lu state
according account qi decided sabotage lu's reforms sending 100 good horses 80 beautiful dancing girls duke lu
duke indulged himself pleasure attend official duties three days
confucius deeply disappointed resolved leave lu seek better opportunities yet leave once expose misbehavior duke therefore bring public humiliation ruler confucius serving
confucius therefore waited duke make lesser mistake
soon after duke neglected send confucius portion sacrificial meat due according custom confucius seized upon pretext leave both post lu state
after confucius' resignation began long journey set journeys around small kingdoms north-east central china traditionally including states wei song chen cai
courts these states expounded political beliefs see them implemented

analects depict spending last years teaching 72 77 disciples transmitting old wisdom via set texts called five classics
during return confucius sometimes acted advisor several government officials lu including ji kangzi matters including governance crime
philosophy main article confucianism dacheng hall main hall temple confucius qufu although confucianism often followed religious manner chinese many argue values secular therefore isn't religion akin secular morality
proponents argue despite secular nature confucianism's teachings based worldview religious
confucianism discusses elements afterlife views concerning heaven relatively unconcerned spiritual matters often considered essential religious thought such nature souls
however confucius believed astrology saying heaven sends down good evil symbols wise men act accordingly
analects confucius analects confucius presents himself transmitter invented nothing
puts greatest emphasis importance study chinese character study 學 opens text
far trying build systematic formalist theory wanted disciples master internalize old classics their deep thought thorough study allow them relate moral problems present past political events recorded annals past expressions commoners' feelings noblemen's reflections poems book odes
ethics deepest teachings confucius may superiority personal exemplification over explicit rules behavior
moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation emulation moral exemplars attainment skilled judgment rather knowledge rules
confucian ethics may considered type virtue ethics
teachings rarely rely reasoned argument ethical ideals methods conveyed indirectly through allusion innuendo even tautology
teachings require examination context order understood
good example found famous anecdote 廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。 stables burnt down returning court confucius anyone hurt? ask horses
analects x
waley 10–13 tr
legge x-17 tr
lau asking horses confucius demonstrates sage values human beings over property readers led reflect whether their response follow confucius' pursue self-improvement
confucius exemplar human excellence serves ultimate model rather deity universally true set abstract principles
these reasons according many commentators confucius' teachings may considered chinese example humanism
teachings variant golden rule sometimes called silver rule owing negative form 己所不欲，勿施於人。 you wish yourself others
子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎？”子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。” zi gong [a disciple] asked there any word guide person throughout life? master replied how 'reciprocity'! never impose others you choose yourself
analects xv

david hinton often overlooked confucian ethics virtues self sincerity cultivation knowledge
virtuous action towards others begins virtuous sincere thought begins knowledge
virtuous disposition without knowledge susceptible corruption virtuous action without sincerity true righteousness
cultivating knowledge sincerity also important one's own sake superior person loves learning sake learning righteousness sake righteousness
confucian theory ethics exemplified lǐ 禮 based three important conceptual aspects life ceremonies associated sacrifice ancestors deities various types social political institutions c etiquette daily behavior
believed lǐ originated heavens confucius stressed development lǐ through actions sage leaders human history
discussions lǐ seem redefine term refer actions committed person build ideal society rather those simply conforming canonical standards ceremony
early confucian tradition lǐ doing proper thing proper time balancing maintaining existing norms perpetuate ethical social fabric violating them order accomplish ethical good
training lǐ past sages cultivates people virtues include ethical judgment lǐ must adapted light situational contexts
confucianism concept li closely related yì 義 based upon idea reciprocity
yì translated righteousness though may simply mean ethically best certain context
term contrasts action done out self-interest
while pursuing one's own self-interest necessarily bad better righteous person one's life based upon following path designed enhance greater good
thus outcome yì doing right thing right reason
just action according lǐ should adapted conform aspiration adhering yì yì linked core value rén 仁
rén consists 5 basic virtues seriousness generosity sincerity diligence kindness
rén virtue perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others most often translated benevolence humaneness translator arthur waley calls goodness capital g other translations put forth include authoritativeness selflessness
confucius' moral system based upon empathy understanding others rather divinely ordained rules
develop one's spontaneous responses rén these guide action intuitively even better living rules yì
confucius asserts virtue means extremes
example properly generous person gives right amount—not too much too little
politics confucius' political thought based upon ethical thought
argued best government rules through rites lǐ people's natural morality using bribery coercion
explained most important analects people led laws uniformity sought given them punishments will try avoid punishment no sense shame
led virtue uniformity sought given them rules propriety will sense shame moreover will become good
translated james legge great learning 大學
sense shame internalisation duty punishment precedes evil action instead following form laws legalism
confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days urged chinese particularly those political power model themselves earlier examples
times division chaos endless wars feudal states wanted restore mandate heaven 天命 unify world 天下 under heaven bestow peace prosperity people
because vision personal social perfections framed revival ordered society earlier times confucius often considered great proponent conservatism closer look proposes often shows used perhaps twisted past institutions rites push new political agenda own revival unified royal state whose rulers succeed power basis their moral merits instead lineage
these rulers devoted their people striving personal social perfection such ruler spread own virtues people instead imposing proper behavior laws rules
confucius believe concept democracy itself athenian concept unknown ancient china interpreted confucius' principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders govern them anyone capable self-government
expressed fears masses lacked intellect make decisions themselves view since everyone created equal everyone right self-government
while supported idea government ruling virtuous king ideas contained number elements limit power rulers
argued representing truth language honesty paramount importance
even facial expression truth must represented
confucius believed ruler lead correctly action orders deemed unnecessary others will follow proper actions their ruler
discussing relationship king subject father son underlined need give due respect superiors
demanded subordinates must give advice their superiors superiors considered taking course action wrong
confucius believed ruling example you lead correctly orders force punishment isn't necessary
disciples main article disciples confucius there much known confucius' disciples little over half them their surnames recorded zuo zhuan
analects records names most likely confucius' disciples while mencius records 24 names although quite certain there many disciples whose name recorded
most confucius' disciples lu state while others neighboring states
example zigong wey state sima niu song state
confucius' favorite disciple yan hui most probably most impoverished them
sima niu contrast yan hui hereditary noble family hailing song state
under confucius' teachings disciples became well-learned principles methods government
often engaged discussion debate students gave high importance their studies history poetry ritual
confucius advocated loyalty principle rather individual acumen reform achieved persuasion rather violence
even though confucius denounced them their practices aristocracy likely attracted idea having trustworthy officials studied morals circumstances time made desirable
fact disciple zilu even died defending ruler wei
yang hu subordinate ji family dominated lu government 505 502 even attempted coup narrowly failed
likely consequence after first disciples confucius appointed government positions
few confucius' disciples went attain official positions importance arranged confucius
time confucius 50 years old ji family consolidated their power lu state over ruling ducal house
even though ji family practices confucius disagreed disapproved nonetheless gave confucius' disciples many opportunities employment
confucius continued remind disciples stay true their principles renounced those while being openly critical ji family
legacy confucius' teachings later turned elaborate set rules practices numerous disciples followers organized teachings analects
confucius' disciples grandson zisi continued philosophical school after death
these efforts spread confucian ideals students then became officials many royal courts china thereby giving confucianism first wide-scale test dogma
two confucius' most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects teachings
centuries after death mencius 孟子 xun zi 荀子 both composed important teachings elaborating different ways fundamental ideas associated confucius
mencius 4 th century bc articulated innate goodness human beings source ethical intuitions guide people towards rén yì lǐ while xun zi 3 rd century bc underscored realistic materialistic aspects confucian thought stressing morality inculcated society through tradition individuals through training
time their writings together analects other core texts came constitute philosophical corpus confucianism
realignment confucian thought parallel development legalism saw filial piety self-interest useful tool ruler create effective state
disagreement these two political philosophies came head 223 bc qin state conquered china
li si prime minister qin dynasty convinced qin shi huang abandon confucians' recommendation awarding fiefs akin zhou dynasty before them saw being against legalist idea centralizing state around ruler
confucian advisers pressed their point li si many confucian scholars killed their books burned—considered huge blow philosophy chinese scholarship
under succeeding han dynasty tang dynasty confucian ideas gained even widespread prominence
under wudi works confucius made official imperial philosophy required reading civil service examinations 140 bc continued nearly unbroken until end 19 th century
moism lost support time han main philosophical contenders legalism confucian thought somewhat absorbed teachings laozi whose focus spiritual ideas kept direct conflict confucianism new buddhist religion gained acceptance during southern northern dynasties era
both confucian ideas confucian-trained officials relied upon ming dynasty even yuan dynasty although kublai khan distrusted handing over provincial control them
during song dynasty scholar zhu xi ad 1130–1200 added ideas daoism buddhism confucianism
life zhu xi largely ignored long after death ideas became new orthodox view confucian texts actually meant
modern historians view zhu xi having created something rather different call way thinking neo-confucianism
neo-confucianism held sway china japan korea vietnam until 19 th century

tradition interrupted several decades mainland china official stance communist party state confucius confucianism represented reactionary feudalist beliefs held subservience people aristocracy part natural order
such ceremonies rites therefore banned
