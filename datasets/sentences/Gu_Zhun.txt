raised questions contemporaries dare tried give tentative answers
process，he gradually moved away idealism still active communist doctrine rediscovered anglo-american empiricism value liberty intrinsic
time dogmas central planning predominated among world pioneers idea socialism should incorporate market economics
arguing socialism aimed good market economy distinct bad ones” found capitalist systems emphasised values rule law constitutionalism
1965 gu zhun forced work xinyang henan province
during mao’s period 200000 people died hunger region
there even cases cannibalism
shocked saw gu began ask how communist idealism doctrinal source such horrors how such tragedy avoided future
“… today people turn idealism dogmas name revolution hence am turning absolutely empiricism pluralism democracy
article commercial production theory value under socialism 1957，he insisted market rather central plan should basis productive decisions
planning expected encompass everything interfere detail processes production transfer let alone perform complete precision
time karl marx mao zedong accredited quasi-divine wisdom their dicta treated infallible unquestionable unalterable gu zhun's new model planning nothing short heresy
time ordinary person reported raised such ideas put prison even executed
these however views enlightened later key economists such sun yewang wu jinglian form core post-mao reforms why capitalism arise britain? britain inherited technologies accumulated renaissance onward gathered experience management navigation developed 16 th century trade advantageous consequences colonization
united kingdom founded whose basic policy protect expansion commercial interests united kingdom expanded immensely through colonization
however goal establish roman style empire like napoleon establish greek style colonial order relatively independent mother country
business adopted form monopolistic companies east indian company south china sea company etc
consisting mostly entrepreneurially-minded aristocrats
mid 19 th century mill emphasized works appropriate state manage business directly
these fact standard british government views since 17 th century
china just opposite monopolies salt iron han dynasty qing dynasty
traditionally these enterprises controlled managed central government
effects different approaches war
napoleonic war won england lost france gu zhun's example
france whose historical heritage many ways similar britain's adopted standard dynastic policies
virtually without exception these led suppression development
britain other hand wars led accumulation wealth leading ultimately industrial revolution
imperialism highest level capitalism according lenin failed follow path predicted lenin just capitalism developed according predictions karl marx
marx predicted inevitable demise capitalism grounds core capitalism ⇒ multiplication capital ⇒ high profit ⇒ lower wages ⇒ insufficient consumption ⇒ creates panic moreover organic composition capital increases commensurable surplus value performance increasingly lowed capital profit margin
thus margin profit capital tends zero capitalism cannot persist long run will die eventually social structural terms capital tends centralised
capitalists deprived contradictions capital private ownership will increase
socialism will finally require slight effort
these predictions belied realities early 20 th century making necessary lenin offer modified theory
unfortunately too failed confirmed
great depression followed economic crisis 1929 third international general crisis 1930 s encouraged rediscovery marx
now 40 years gone
time gu zhun's writing no repeat great depression taken place unlikely ever
why? reason capitalism's great vitality apart new technology products materials big companies governments trade union addition pluralistic philosophy academic freedom democratic politics limit tried develop critique
capitalism may pile evil fact constantly exposed given unceasingly attention
improvements great small thus made
hence capitalism enabled continue …i see capitalism cannot extinguished through violent revolution because improvement through critique
