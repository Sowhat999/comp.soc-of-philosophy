economic works theories overview economic writings 1899 before discussing petty's economic theories important point out two crucial influences life
[tone] first thomas hobbes whom petty acted personal secretary
according hobbes theory should set out rational requirements 'civil peace material plenty'
hobbes centred peace petty chose prosperity
[citation needed] secondly influence francis bacon profound
bacon indeed hobbes held conviction mathematics senses must basis rational sciences
passion accuracy led petty famously declare form science use measurable phenomena seek quantitative precision rather rely comparatives superlatives yielding new subject named political arithmetic
petty thus carved niche himself first dedicated economic scientist amidst merchant-pamphleteers such thomas mun josiah child philosopher-scientists occasionally discussing economics such john locke
indeed writing before true development political economy
such many claims precision imperfect quality
nonetheless petty three main works economics treatise taxes contributions written 1662 verbum sapienti 1665 quantulumcunque concerning money 1682 refreshingly concise
[editorializing] these works received great attention 1690 s show theories major areas later become economics
follows analysis most important theories those fiscal contributions national wealth money supply circulation velocity value interest rate international trade government investment
fiscal contributions fiscal contributions prime concern policymakers 17 th century remained ever since wise country spend above revenues
petty's time england engaged war holland first three chapters treatise taxes contributions petty sought establish principles taxation public expenditure monarch adhere deciding how raise money war
petty lists six kinds public charge namely defence governance pastorage men's souls education maintenance impotents sorts infrastructure things universal good
then discusses general particular causes changes these charges
thinks there great scope reduction first four public charges recommends increased spending care elderly sick orphans etc
well government employment supernumeraries
issue raising taxes petty definite proponent consumption taxes
recommended general taxes should just sufficient meet various types public charges listed
should also horizontally equitable regular proportionate
condemned poll taxes very unequal excise beer taxing poor excessively
recommended much higher quality statistical information raise taxes fairly
imports should taxed such way put them level playing field domestic produce
vital aspect economies time transforming barter economies money economies
linked aware scarcity money petty recommends taxes payable forms other gold silver estimated less 1% national wealth
too much importance placed money 'which whole effect kingdom… [even] 100'
national income accounting making above estimate petty introduces first two chapters verbum sapienti first rigorous assessments national income wealth
too obvious country's wealth lay just gold silver
worked off estimation average personal income £6 13 s 4 per annum population six million meaning national income £40 m
petty produces estimates reliable others various components national income including land ships personal estates housing
then distinguishes stocks £250 m flows yielding them £15 m
discrepancy these flows estimate national income £40 m leads petty postulate other £25 m yield must £417 m labour stock value people
gives total wealth england 1660 s £667 m
statistician sir william petty petty's statistical technique use simple averages
statistician today's standards during time statistician merely employed use quantitative data
because obtaining census data difficult impossible especially ireland applied methods estimation
way estimate population start estimating population london
either estimating exports deaths
method using exports considering 30 percent increase exports corresponds similar proportionate increase population
way use deaths multiplying number deaths 30 estimating out thirty people die each year
obtain population england multiply population london
such simple use estimation easily abused petty accused once doctoring figures crown
henry spiegel money supply velocity circulation figure stock wealth contrasted money supply gold silver £6 m
petty believed there certain amount money nation needed drive trade
hence possible too little money circulating economy mean people rely barter
also possible there too much money economy
topical question asks chapter 3 verbum sapienti £6 m enough drive nation's trade especially king wanted raise additional funds war holland? answer petty lay velocity money's circulation
anticipating quantity theory money often initiated john locke whereby yp = msv petty stated increased given money supply 'revolutions' must occur smaller circles
higher v
done through establishment bank
explicitly states verbum sapienti nor money wanting answer ends well policed state notwithstanding great decreases thereof happened within these twenty years p
113 higher velocity answer
also mentions there nothing unique gold silver fulfilling functions money money means end end itself nor hard substitute place money [gold silver] comptency wanting should equivalent unto
money fat body-politick whereof too much doth often hinder agility too little makes sick
doth money state quicken action feeds abroad time dearth home
hull 1899 p
113 striking these passages intellectual rigour put far ahead mercantilist writers earlier century
also interesting note use biological analogies illustrate point trend continued physiocrats france early 18 th century
theory value value petty continued debate begun aristotle chose develop input-based theory value things ought valued two natural denominations land labour p
both these prime sources taxable income
like richard cantillon after sought devise equation par 'mother father' output land labour express value accordingly
still included general productivity one's 'art industry'
applied theory value rent
natural rent land excess labourer produces year over ate himself traded necessities
therefore profit above various costs related factors involved production
interest rate natural rate rent related theories usury
time many religious writers still condemned charging interest sinful
petty also involved himself debate usury interest rates regarding phenomenon reward forbearance part lender
incorporating theories value asserted perfect security rate interest should equal rent land principal bought again precocious insight later become general equilibrium findings
security 'casual' return should greater return risk
having established justification usury itself forbearance then shows hobbesian qualities arguing against any government regulation interest rate pointing 'vanity fruitlessness making civil positive laws against laws nature' p
laissez-faire governance major themes petty's writings summed up use phrase vadere sicut vult whence get laissez-faire
mentioned earlier motif medicine also useful petty warned against over-interference government economy seeing analogous physician tampering excessively patient
applied monopolies controls exportation money trade commodities
vain harmful nation
recognised price effects monopolies citing french king's salt monopoly example
another work political arithmetic petty also recognised importance economies scale
described phenomenon division labour asserting good both better quality cheaper many work
petty gain greater 'as manufacture itself greater'
foreign exchange control trade efflux specie petty thought vain try control dangerous leave merchants decide goods nation buys smaller amount money
noted quantulumcunque concerning money countries plentiful gold no such laws restricting specie
exports general regarded prescriptions such recent acts parliament forbidding export wool yarn 'burthensome'
further restrictions 'would us twice much harm losse our trade' p
59 albeit concession no expert study wool trade
prohibiting imports example holland such restrictions little other drive up prices useful imports vastly exceeded exports
petty saw far use going holland learning whatever skills trying resist nature
epitomizing viewpoint thought preferable sell cloth 'debauching' foreign wines rather leave clothiers unemployed
full employment goal full employment most importance petty having recognised labour major sources wealth individuals 'the greatest wealth strength kingdom'
vein extended cloth-wine argument above arguing better employ men burn their product engage extravagant public works projects indolent 'supernumeraries' economy hence famous example relocating stonehenge across plains salisbury
division labour political arithmetick petty made practical study division labour showing existence usefulness dutch shipyards
classically workers shipyard build ships units finishing before starting another
dutch organised several teams each doing same tasks successive ships
people particular task must discovered new methods later observed justified writers political economy
petty also applied principle survey ireland
breakthrough divide up work large parts done people no extensive training
urban society petty projected growth city london supposed might swallow rest england far actually happened now city double people 40 years present number 670000 whole territory 7400000 double 360 years aforesaid then underwritten table appears
1840 people city will 10718880 those whole country 10917389 inconsiderably
wherefore certain necessary growth city must stop before year 1840 will utmost height next preceding period
1800 number city will eight times present number 5359000
besides number there will 4466000 perform tillage pasturage other rural works necessary done without city
growth city london among essays downloadable gutenberg link
imagined future city london seven times bigger now inhabitants 4690000 people other cities ports towns villages there 2710000
expected time round 1800 extrapolating existing trends
long before malthus noticed potential human population increase
also saw no reason why such society should prosperous
summary legacy above shows contribution petty made theoretical issues dominated later subject economics ever since
covered such wide range topics according political arithmetic method
like modern economists set out prove claims finding data statistics rather relying anecdotal evidence
rigorously also concision humour
issues petty thought major topics plagued minds economic theorists ever since
influenced immediate successors such richard cantillon also greatest minds economics including adam smith karl marx john maynard keynes
adam smith shared world view believed harmonious natural world
parallels their canons taxation epitomise their joint belief natural liberty equality
both saw benefits specialisation division labour
furthermore smith petty developed labour theories value david ricardo henry george karl marx 19 th century
smith says nothing petty wealth nations
published writings there nothing apart reference letter lord shelburne petty's aristocratic descendants correspondence adam smith letter no
30 glasgow edition
petty continued exercise influence
karl marx believed petty total effort put aggregate ordinary workers represented far greater contribution economy contemporary thought recognised
belief led petty conclude estimates labour ranked greatest source wealth kingdom
marx's conclusions surplus labour source profit labourer alienated surplus thus society
marx's high esteem adam smith mirrored high consideration petty's analysis witnessed countless quotations major work das kapital
john maynard keynes also time mass discord unemployment rampant economies stagnant during 1930 s
showed how governments manage aggregate demand stimulate output employment much petty done simpler examples 17 th century
petty's simple £100-through-100-hands multiplier refined keynes incorporated model
