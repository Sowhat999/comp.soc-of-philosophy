during first fourteen years life lived alongside grandfather zayn al-abedin witnessed latter's withdrawal politics

imamate see also imamah shia doctrine al-sadiq thirty four thirty seven inherited position imamah imamate father muhammad al-baqir
held imamate 28 years longer any other shiite imam
imamate crucial period islamic history both political doctrinal areas
prior al-sadiq majority shiites preferred revolutionary politics zaid al-sadiq's uncle mystical quietism al-sadiq's father grandfather
zaid claimed position imam conditional appearing publicly claim rights
al-sadiq other hand elaborated doctrine imamate says imamate matter human choice self-assertion each imam possesses unique ilm knowledge qualifies position
knowledge passed down prophet muhammad through line ali's immediate descendants
doctrine nass divinely inspired designation each imam previous imam therefore completed al-sadiq
[a] spite being designated imam al-sadiq hold lay claim caliphate
under umayyad rulers al-sadiq's imamate extended over latter half umayyad caliphate marked many revolts mostly shiite movements eventually violent overthrow umayyad caliphate abbasids decedents muhammad's uncle abbas
al-sadiq maintained predecessors' policy quietism played no part numerous rebellions
stayed out uprising zaydits gathered around al-sadiq's uncle zayd support mu'tazilites traditionalists medina kufa
al-sadiq also support rebellion led cousin muhammad al-nafs al-zakiyya inspired kaysanites
al-sadiq played no part abbassid rebellion against umayyads
response message requesting help abu muslim khorasani leader uprising against umayyads became famous
al-sadiq asked lamp burned abu muslim's letter saying envoy brought tell your master you seen
burning abû muslim's letter also man my men time mine
al-sadiq also evaded other requests assistance other claims throne without advancing own claims
even though designated imam true leader ummah press claim caliphate
under abbasid rulers end umayyad dynasty beginning abbasid period during central authority weak allowing al-sadiq teach freely school trained four thousands students
among these abū ḥanīfa malik ibn anas founder two major sunni schools law hanafiyah malikiyah
wasil ibn ata founder mu`tazila school also among pupils
after abbasid revolution overthrown umayyad caliphate turned against shiite groups previously allies against umayyads
new abbasid rulers risen power basis their descent muhammad's uncle abbas ibn ‘abd al-muttalib suspicious al-sadiq because shiites believed leadership ummah position issued divine order given each imam previous imam
addition al-sadiq large following both among scholars among those believed imam
during rule al-mansur al-sadiq summoned baghdad along other prominent men medina order caliph keep close watch them
al-sadiq however asked caliph excuse going there reciting hadith man goes away make living will achieve purpose sticks family will prolong life
al-mansur reportedly accepted request
after defeat death cousin muhammad al-nafs al-zakiyya 762 however al-sadiq thought advisable obey al-mansur's summons
after short stay baghdad however convinced caliph threat allowed return medina
toward end life subject harassment abbasid caliphs
governor medina instructed caliph burn down house event reportedly al-sadiq no harm
[b] cut ties followers al-sadiq also watched closely occasionally imprisoned

following wife's death al-sadiq purchased berbery andalusian slave named hamidah khātūn arabic حميدة خاتون‎ freed her trained her islamic scholar then married her
she bore two sons musa al-kadhim seventh twelver imam muhammad al-dibaj
she revered shiites especially women her wisdom
she known hamidah pure
ja'far al-sadiq used send women learn tenets islam her hamidah pure every impurity like ingot pure gold
death historical tomb al-baqi' destroyed 1926
ja'far al-sadiq four shia imams buried here
al-sadiq arrested several times umayyad abbasid caliphs hisham saffah mansur
according sources[c] poisoned through behest mansur 148/765 age 64 65 leading uncertainty future imamate
buried medina famous jannatul baqee cemetery tomb place pilgrimage until 1926
wahhabis conquered medina second time 1925 razed many tombs ground exception muhammad's tomb
according tabatabai upon hearing news al-sadiq's death mansur wanted put end imamate
mansur reportedly governor medina commanding read imam's testament behead person named future imam
however governor found al-sadiq chosen four people rather mansur himself governor imam's oldest son abdullah al-aftah musa al-kazim younger son
succession shiite group begun split during lifetime al-sadiq eldest son isma'il ibn jafar predeceased
death occurred presence many witnesses
after death ja'far al-sadiq following fractured further larger group came known twelvers following younger son musa al-kadhim
another group believed instead isma'il designated next imam since predeceased father imamate passed isma'il's son muhammad ibn ismail descendants
latter group became known isma'ilis
isma'ilis believe isma'il actually died reappear mahdi rejuvenator islam shiite doctrine
still other groups accepted either abdullah al-aftah muhammad ibn ja'far al-sadiq al-dibaj both sons ja'far al-sadiq imam
final group believed al-sadiq last imam lineage continued
after death musa al-kazim majority followers recognized son ali al-ridha eighth imam while others believed al-kazim last imam
latter group became known waqifiyah
no major divisions occurred shiitism eighth twelfth imam whom majority shiite considered muhammad al-mahdi
among sects separated majority zaidiyyah ismaili continue exist today
religious views al-sadiq religious views recorded authority writing number contradictory positions
use name authority within sufi scientific sunni legal ismaili extremist writings shows importance figure within development early muslim thought
according ya'qubi customary anyone wanted relate tradition say learned informed us
malik ibn anas quoting anything al-sadiq say thiqa truthful ja'far
muhammad himself me that… same reported abu hanifa
works attributed may dubious authenticity establish name least indicating mastery learning generally islamic sciences particular
though most groups wished recruit al-sadiq's legacy their own cause most extensive source teachings found within imami shiite tradition
twelver shiites ja'far al-ṣadiq sixth imam established shiism serious intellectual force late umayyad early abbasid periods
according tabatabai number traditions left behind al-sadiq father hadiths recorded muhammad other shiite imams combined
shiite thought starting sayyid haydar amuli leading safavid philosophers like mir damad mulla sadra qazi sa’id qumi continuing present day based shiite imam's tradition specially al-sadiq
ja'fari school law shiite jurisprudence became known ja'fari jurisprudence after ja'far al-sadiq whose legal dicta most important source shiite law
like sunni law ja'fari jurisprudence based quran hadith also based consensus ijma
unlike sunnis shiites give weight reasoning 'aql while sunnis allow kind analogical reasoning qiyas
al-sadiq presented denounces personal opinion raʾy analogical reasoning qiās contemporaries arguing god’s law occasional unpredictable servants' duty embark reasoning order discover law submit inscrutable will god revealed imam
book maqbula omar ibn ḥanẓala disciple al-sadiq asks imam how legal disputes within community should solved whether should take such cases ruler sultan judges
ja'far al-sadiq replies negative saying those take their disputes rulers their judges get soḥt unlawful decision
instead al-sadiq recommends unofficial system justice community disputants should turn those relate our [i
imams'] hadiths
reason imams made such judge ḥākem over you
theology ja'far al-sadiq's view theology transmitted through mufazzel recorded own questions al-sadiq's answers book known ketab al-tawhid al-sadiq gives proofs unity god
book considered identical ketāb al-ehlilaja reply mufazzel's request al-sadiq refutation those deny god
hesham ibn ḥakam
179/796 another famous student imam proposed number doctrines later became orthodox shiite theology including rational necessity divinely guided imam every age teach lead god's community
al-sadiq attributed statement whoever claims god ordered evil lied god
whoever claims both good evil attributed lied god
view accordance mu'tazilite doctrine seems absolve god responsibility evil world
al-sadiq says god does order created beings something without providing them means doing though without god's permission
al-sadiq expressed moderate view compulsion jabr giving choice man tafviz stating god decreed things absolutely left others human agency
assertion widely adopted afterwards called al-amr bayn al-amrayn meant neither predestination nor delegation position two
al-ṣadiq's view therefore recorded supporting either position reported exchange unknown interlocutor
interlocutor asks god forces servants evil whether delegated power them
al-sadiq's answers negatively both questions
asked then? replies blessings your lord these two
tafsir works attributed jafar al-sadiq tafsir quranic exegesis mostly described sufi-mystical works such tafsir al-qorʾān manāfeʿ ṣowar al-qorʾān ḵawāsâsâ al-qorʾān al-aʿẓam
attribution these works al-sadiq however suspected
books ḥaqāʾeq al-tafsir ziādāt ḥaqāʾeq al-tafsir ʿabd-al-raḥmān solami cites al-ṣadiq major major source knowledge concerning meaning quranic verses
ketāb al-jafr early mystical commentary quran tafsir also attributed al-sadiq
according ibn khaldun originally written skin young bull allowing imam reveal hidden meaning quran
al-sadiq proposed fourfold model quran interpretation
book god comprises four things statement set down implied purport hidden meanings relating supra-sensible world exalted spiritual doctrines
plain meanings commmon people hidden meanings elite implied meanings friends god exalted spiritual doctrines province prophets
stated hadith traditional sayings prophet should rejected contradicted quran
doctrine taqiyyah see also taqiyyah al-sadiq adopted taqiyyah defensive tool against violence threats directed against shiites
taqiyya form religious dissimulation legal dispensation whereby believing individual deny their faith while fear risk significant persecution
other words taqiyya says acceptable hide one's true opinions revealing them puts oneself others danger
doctrine developed al-sadiq served protect shiites al-mansur abbasid caliph conducted brutal oppressive campaign against alids their supporters
according moezzi early sources taqiyya means keeping safeguarding secrets imams' teaching
divergence traditions therefore sometimes justified shiite imams result need using taqiyya
certain [the imams] proclaim truth al-haqq may satisfied our teaching asserts al-sadiq hears us say something contradictory heard earlier should know acting own interest
practicing taqiyya also esoteric significance those believed their teachings should comprehensible ordinary ulama hid their profound teachings
works according haywood half dozen religious works bear al-sadiq's name author though none them firmly described being written al-ṣadiq
probable al-sadiq author left writing students
alchemist geber example suggested works little records jaʿfar's teaching summaries hundreds monographs written
ja'far al-sadiq also cited wide range historical sources including al-tabari al-yaqubi al-masudi
al-dhahabi recognizes contribution sunni tradition isma'ili scholars such qadi al-nu'man recorded traditions their work
ketāb al-jafr commentary quran according ibn khaldun first written skin young bull allowed al-sadiq reveal hidden meaning quran
various versions will number collections legal dicta attributed well
there many reports attributed early shiite hadith collections such muhammad ibn ya'qub al-kulayni's kitab al-kafi featured central sources imami doctrine
al-haft wa'l-aẓella ketāb al-ṣerāṭ containing secret revelations mofażżal also attributed al-sadiq important role elaboration esoteric doctrine nosayris whom al-ṣadiq influential figure
