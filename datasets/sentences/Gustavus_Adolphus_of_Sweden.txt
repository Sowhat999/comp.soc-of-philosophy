matter fact opponent johann tserclaes count tilly also favored same ferocious charges swedish cavalry become famous
neither swedish practice integrating shot horse so-called commanded shot new huguenot horsemen battle coutras having same supporting shooters
made swedish army unique regard fact use commanded shot became standard tactical doctrine horse turn adopted other armies period including imperial opponents english civil war
adolphus better deserved credit introducing standard caliber light muskets infantry forces replacing previous mix arquebus heavy musket common imperial tercios
shallower infantry formation swedish brigade much conducive massed firepower inspired work maurice
however adolphus perfected system introduced use salvo fire two three ranks musketeers fired simultaneously usually point blank range rather rank time counter marching common era
'swedish salve' much effective breaking enemy's morale repulsing cavalry charges earlier method

alternative views german socialist franz mehring biography gustavus adolphus marxist perspective actions swedish king during thirty years' war
makes case war fought over economics trade rather religion
swedes discovered huge deposits copper used build brass cannon
cottage-industrial growth stimulated armaments industry
book ofredsår years warfare swedish historian author peter englund argues there probably no single all-important reason king's decision go war
instead likely combination religious security well economic considerations
image king gustav adolph wall stockholm palace
view supported german historian johannes burkhardt writes gustavus entered 30 years war exactly 100 years after publication confessio augustana core confession faith lutheran church let himself praised saviour
yet gustavus' own manifesto war does mention any religious motivations speaks political economical reasons
sweden maintain integrity face several provocations aggressions habsburgian empire
manifesto written scholar johann adler salvius style common time promotes just war
burkhardt argues traditional swedish historiography constructed defensive interest security out taking manifesto's text granted
defend stockholm occupation german baltic territories extreme advance imperial baltic sea fleet mentioned threat manifesto never reached quarter size swedish fleet
moreover never maintained challenge sweden face separatist netherlands
ruling baltic sea goal swedish strategy conquests germany defensive war act expansion
swedish finland gustavus advanced along baltic sea coast eventually augsburg munich even urged swiss confederacy join
no longer baltic interests imperial capital vienna alpine passes now close reach swedish army
burkhardt points out gothic legacy swedes coalesced political program
swedish king also rex gotorum latin king goths list kings traced back gothic rulers construct continuity
prior embarkment northern germany gustavus urged swedish nobility follow example conquests set their gothic ancestors
lived longer likely gustavus reached out imperial crown holy roman empire
