book's first part theoretical understanding human conduct develops theory human action exercise intelligent agency activities such wanting choosing second civil condition discusses formal conditions association appropriate such intelligent agents described civil legal association third character modern european state examines how far understanding human association affected politics political ideas post-renaissance european history
oakeshott suggests there two major modes understandings human social organization
