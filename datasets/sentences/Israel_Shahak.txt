zerah warhaftig refute rabbinical ruling quoted traditional jewish sources according jewish doctors saved lives non-jews sabbath although required
1966 immanuel jakobovits later became chief rabbi united hebrew congregations britain commonwealth disputed veracity shahak's story
jakobovits alleged shahak eventually forced admit orthodox jew witnessed jakobovits words simply exist
jakobovits whole incident fabricated true protocols style

’ following year zeev falk though disapproved shahak's allegedly invented [] case positive outcome
while dissociate myself methods action dr
israel shahak invented case gentile given treatment sabbath fiction led chief rabbi unterman issue ruling permitting violation sabbath order save life gentile
shahak repeated account opening chapter 1994 book jewish history jewish religion stating neither israeli nor diaspora rabbinical authorities ever reversed their ruling jew should violate sabbath order save life gentile
added much sanctimonious twaddle effect consequence such act puts jews danger violation sabbath permitted their sake
writing 2008 rabbi shmuley boteach stated beginning story curious
prohibition there possibly allowing someone else use one's phone sabbath? cited eli beer chief coordinator israel's volunteer ambulance service oversees 1100 medical volunteers approximately 60 percent whom orthodox stating someone say won't save non-jewish life sabbath liar
jewish christian muslim save everyone's life any day year including sabbath yom kippur done myself

reception memoirs arab israel palestinian poet fouzi el-asmar described shahak remarkable outstanding individual gore vidal introduction shahak's jewish history jewish religion weight three thousand years described there 'the latest last great prophets
according haim genizi shahak's extreme anti-israeli statements welcomed plo widely circulated pro-arab circles
after death shahak received tributes number sources
friend co-author historian norton mezvinsky stated rare intellectual giant superior humanist edward described very brave man should honored services humanity
christopher hitchens considered shahak dear friend comrade brilliant devoted student archaeology jerusalem palestine during chairmanship israeli league human civil rights [he] set personal example very difficult emulate
com alexander cockburn described tireless translator erudite footnoter singular man original while allan c
brownfeld american council judaism writing washington report middle east affairs opposed racism oppression any form any country genuinely prophetic jewish voice ardently advocated democracy human rights
obituary guardian elfi pallis described old-fashioned liberal while michel warschawski described last israeli liberal stated above last philosophers 18 th century school enlightenment rationalism liberalism american meaning concept
shahak accused fabricating incidents blaming victim distorting normative meaning jewish texts misrepresenting jewish belief law
according paul bogdanor shahak regaled audience stream outrageous libels ludicrous fabrications transparent hoaxes
each successive allegation exposed discredited simply proceed new invention
ari alexander co-founder children abraham organization jewish-islamic dialogue while noting widespread use shahak's works neo-nazis arab countries concludes texts shahak cites real though shahak's sporadic use footnotes makes difficult check them
oftentimes interpretation these texts debatable their prominence judaism negligible nonetheless part jewish tradition therefore cannot ignored
reaction writings judaism talmud shahak accused antisemitism
anti-defamation league listed shahak four authors polemics paper talmud anti-semitic polemics while bogdanor accused shahak recycling soviet antisemitic propaganda
1995 werner cohn shahak without question world's most conspicuous jewish antisemite
like nazis before shahak specialized defaming talmud
fact made life's work popularize anti-talmud ruminations 18 th century german antisemite johann eisenmenger
emanuele ottolenghi argues jews like shahak act enablers antisemites stating their rhetoric plays crucial role
excusing condoning — effect — abetting anti-semitism
view anti-semites rely jews confirm their prejudice jews recur such language advocate such policies how anyone accused anti-semitism making same arguments? [
mechanism through anti-semitic accusation becomes respectable once jew endorses limited israel’s new historians
israel shahak made comparison israel nazism respectable — while describing judaism according medieval canons blood libel
while agreeing shahak's works contribute antisemitism dan rickman writing guardian completely dismissive shahak ignores [the dialectical nature humanist] aspects sources
further through overstating case analysis fits antisemitic traditions such accusations against talmud
copies talmud burned text talmud studied today still heavily censored
shahak's view chauvinism these sources any way justifies antisemitism also very troubling
however believe trenchant critique judaism tragically without force
contemporary situation see modern orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources modern rulings
orthodox rabbis organisations such rabbis human rights sadly exception rather rule
