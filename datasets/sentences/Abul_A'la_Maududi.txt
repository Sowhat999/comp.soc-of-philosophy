maududi ji especially influential early years general zia ul-haq's rule

maududi arrested military deployment headed lieutenant general azam khan sentenced death part agitation

sought mujaddid renewing tajdid religion
role great responsibility believed mujaddid whole undertake perform same kind work accomplished prophet
while earlier mujaddids renewed religion wanted also propagate true islam absence accounted failure earlier efforts tajdid
according least biographer vali nasr maududi ji moved away their controversial doctrinal ideas e
criticism sufism ulama closer orthodox islam over course career order expandthe base support jama'at-e islami
qur'an maududi believed quran just religious literature recited pondered investigated hidden truths according vali nasr socio-religious institution work accepted face value obeyed
implementing prescriptions ills societies solved
pitted truth bravery against ignorance falsehood evil
book contains message invitation generates movement
moment began sent down impelled quiet pious man
raise voice against falsehood pitted grim struggle against lords disbelief evil iniquity
drew every pure noble soul gathered them under banner truth
every part country made mischievous corrupt rise wage war against bearers truth
tafsir quranic interpretation tafhimu'l-qur'an introduced four interrelated concepts believed essential understanding quran ilah divinity rabb lord `ibadah worship meaning cherishing praising god acting out absolute obedience din religion
islam maududi saw muslims simply those followed religion islam almost everything because obedience divine law defines muslim everything universe 'muslim' obeys allah submission laws
laws physical universe -- heaven above earth night follows day etc
-- much part sharia banning consumption alcohol interest debts
thus followed stars planets oceans rocks atoms etc
should actually considered muslims since obey their creator's laws
rather muslims being minority among humans religious group among many non-muslims small minority among everything universe
creatures humans jinn endowed free will non-muslim humans jinn choose use will disobey laws their creator
rejecting islam maududi believed non-muslim struggled against truth very tongue account ignorance advocates denial god professes multiple deities very nature 'muslim'
man denies god called kafir concealer because conceals disbelief inherent nature embalmed own soul
whole body functions obedience instinct… reality becomes estranged dark
since muslim obeys divine law simply having made shahada declaration belief oneness god acceptance muhammad god's prophet being born muslim family does make you muslim
nor seeking knowledge god part religion islam
muslim slave god absolute obedience god fundamental right god
muslim does right choose way life himself assume whatever duties likes
maududi believed islam covered aspects life
islam 'religion' sense term commonly understood
system encompassing fields living
islam means politics economics legislation science humanism health psychology sociology
system makes no discrimination basis race color language other external categories
appeal mankind
wants reach heart every human being
these aspects islam maududi primarily interested culture—preserving islamic dress language customs believed dangers women's emancipation secularism nationalism etc
also important separate realm islam non-islam—to form boundaries around islam
also proven scientifically maududi believed islam eventually
emerge world-religion cure man maladies
many muslims including many ulama considered islam maududi
maudid complained `not 0
001%` muslim knew islam actually
maududi idealized first years muslim society muhammad rightly guided caliphs considered came after un-islamic jahiliya—with exception brief religious revivals
muslim philosophy literature arts mysticism syncretic impure diverting attention divine
hadith maududi unique perspective transmission hadith—the doings sayings islamic prophet muhammad form part basis islamic law
rather basing judgement quality hadith number reliability chain transmission known isnad hadith passed orally before being written down judgments generations muhaddithin hadith scholars maududi believed intuition extensive study practice develop power intuitively sense wishes desires holy prophet
seeing hadith tell whether holy prophet
women maududi preached duty women manage household bring up children provide them her husband greatest possible comfort contentment
maududi supported complete veiling segregation women practiced most muslim india time
women believed should remain their homes except absolutely necessary
room argument saw matter veiling/hijab whether hands face women covered left uncovered
question maududi came down side complete covering women's faces whenever left their homes
concerning separation genders preached men should avoid looking women other their wives mothers sisters etc
mahram much less trying make their acquaintance
opposed birth control family planning rebellion against laws nature unnecessary because population growth led economic development
maududi opposed allowing women either head state legislator since according islam active politics administration field activity womenfolk
allowed elect their own all-woman legislature men's legislature should consult matters concerning women's welfare
their legislature also full right criticize matters relating general welfare country though vote them
economics although maududi primarily interested cultural issues rather socioeconomic ones complete system islam included economic program strike balance harshness capitalism restriction property rights socialism
embodying virtues two inferior systems none their shortcomings
same time islamic economics kind mixed economy/social democratic compromise distinct superior system
believed economic exploitation poverty brought private wealth property lack virtue public welfare among wealthy turn brought lack adherence sharia law
islamic society greed selfishness dishonesty replaced virtue eliminating need state make any significant intervention economy
before economy like government other parts society islamized islamic revolution-through-education take place develop virtue create support total sharia law
put maududi political disadvantage populist socialist programs because solution neither immediate nor tangible
islamic laws dealing property money payment zakat other islamic taxes etc
maududi emphasised elimination interest loans riba
according scholar because british india hindus dominated money lending trade
socialism populism unlike islamists like ayatollah ruhollah khomeini maududi visceral antipathy socialism spent much time denouncing godless well being unnecessary redundant face islamic state
staunch defender rights property warned workers peasants you must never take exaggerated view your rights protagonists class war present before you
also believe intervention economy provide universal employment
islam does make binding society provide employment each every citizens since responsibility cannot accepted without thorough nationalisation country's resources
maududi held position despite popularity populism among many pakistanis despite poverty vast gap rich poor pakistan often described feudal jagirdari large landholdings rural poverty
maududi openly opposed land reform proposals punjab prime minister liaquat ali khan 1950 s going far justify feudalism pointing islam's protection property rights
later softened views extolling economic justice equity egalitarianism cautioned government against tampering lawful jagirdari continuing emphasise sanctity private property
islamic modernism maududi believed islam supported modernization westernization
agreed islamic modernists islam contained nothing contrary reason superior rational terms other religious systems
disagreed their practice examining quran sunnah using reason standard instead starting proposition `true reason islamic` accepting book sunnah rather reason final authority
also took narrow view ijtihad limiting authority use those thorough grounding islamic sciences faith sharia then serve needs vision islamic state
same time least scholar maryam jameelah noted extensive use modern non-traditionally islamic ideas western idioms concepts maududi's thought
islam revolutionary ideology dynamic movement jama'at-e-islami party shari'ah complete code islam's total scheme life
enthusiasm [western idioms concepts] infectious among those admired encouraging them implement pakistan manifestos programmes schemes' usher true islamic renaissance
mughal empire abul a'la maududi condemned religious ideas mughal emperor akbar controversially known din-e ilahi religion god form apostasy
contemporary scholars such s
ikram argue akbar's true intentions create iradat muridi discipleship new religion
secularism maududi see secularism way state/government dampen tensions divisions multi-religious societies remaining religiously neutral avoid choosing sides
rather believed removed religion society translated secularism urdu din literally religionless
since believed morality came religion necessarily mean exclusion morality ethics human decency controlling mechanisms society
avoid restraints morality divine guidance out pragmatism higher motive espoused secularism
science maududi believed modern science `body` accommodate any `spirit`—philosophy value system—just radio broadcast islami western messages equal facility
nationalism maududi strongly opposed concept nationalism believing shirk polytheism western concept divided muslim world thus prolonged supremacy western imperialist powers
after pakistan formed maududi ji forbade pakistanis take oath allegiance state until became islamic arguing muslim clear conscience render allegiance god
ulama maududi also criticized traditionalist clergy ulama their moribund scholastic style servile political attitudes ignorance modern world
believed traditional scholars unable distinguish fundamentals islam details application built up elaborate structures medieval legal schools fiqh islamic jurisprudence
rid islam these obscure laws muslims should return quran sunna ignoring judgments made after reign first four rightfully guided caliphs al-khulafāʾu ar-rāshidūn islam
maududi also believed there little need traditional roll ulama leaders judges guardians community reformed rationalized islamic order those trained modern well traditional subjects practice ijtihad muslims educated properly arabic quran hadith etc
however over time maududi became orthodox attitudes including toward ulama times allied himself party them after formation pakistan
sufism popular islam like other contemporary revivalists maududi critical sufism historical influence
also went record denying any antagonism toward sufism himself jama'at
according least biographer change position result importance sufism pakistan among muslim masses ulama well
time maududi distinguished sufism shaikhs like `alau'ddin shah approved shrines festivals rituals popular sufism
also redefined sufism describing traditional sense form spirit esoteric dimension islam way measure concentration morals religion saying example say our prayers fiqh will judge us fulfillment outward requirements such ablution facing toward ka'ba
while tasawwuf sufism will judge our prayers our concentration
effect our prayers our morals manners
mid-1960 s onward redefinition islam increasingly gave way outright recognition sufism after maududi's death ji amir qazi hussain ahmad went far visit sufi data durbar shrine lahore 1987 part tour generate mass support ji
sharia maududi believed sharia just crucial command helped define meant muslim something without muslim society islamic islamic society consciously resolves accept sharia decides enact own constitution laws borrow them any other source disregard sharia such society breaks contract god forfeits right called 'islamic
many unbelievers agreed god creator made them unbelievers their failure submit will
god's law
obedience god's law will historical controversy islam awakened throughout world
brought heavenly reward earthly blessing
failure obey rebellion against brought eternal punishment evil misery here earth
source sharia found quran also sunnah doings sayings islamic prophet muhammad since quran proclaimed whoever obeys messenger [i
muhammad] obeys allah
[quran 480] sharia perhaps most famous calling abolition interest-bearing banks hadd penalties such flogging amputation alcohol consumption theft fornication adultery other crimes
hadd penalties criticized westernized muslims cruel violation international human rights maududi argued any cruelty far outweighed cruelty west resulted absence these punishments any case applied until muslims fully understood teachings their faith lived islamic state
fact sharia much these laws
recognizes no division religion other aspects life maududi's view there no area human activity concern sharia address specific divine guidance
family relationships social economic affairs administration rights duties citizens judicial system laws war peace international relations
short embraces various departments life
sharia complete scheme life all-embracing social order nothing superfluous nothing lacking
very large part sharia required coercive power authority state enforcement
consequently while state based islam legislature ruler must consult function really law-finding law-making
same time maududi states somewhat astonishingly according scholar there yet another vast range human affairs sharia totally silent islamic state may write independent legislation
according scholar vali nasr maududi believed sharia needed streamlined reinterpreted expanded address questions governance extent required state function
example sharia needed make clear relation various branches government
islamic revolution though phrase islamic revolution commonly associated 1979 iranian revolution general zia's islamisation maududi coined popularized 1940 s
process maududi envisioned—changing hearts minds individuals top society downward through educational process da'wah—was very different happened iran under zia ul-haq
maududi talked islam being revolutionary ideology revolutionary practice aims destroying social order world totally rebuilding scratch opposed sudden change violent unconstitutional action uninterested grassroots organizing socio-economic changes
revolution achieved step-by-step patience since sudden change short-lived
warned against emotionalism demonstrations agitations
flag waving slogans
impassioned speeches
like believed societies built structured controlled top down conscious manipulation those power grassroots movements
revolution carried out training cadre pious dedicated men lead then protect islamic revolutionary process
facilitate far-reaching program cultural change party invested heavily producing disseminating publications
maududi committed non-violent legal politics even current methods struggle takes century bear fruit
1957 outlined new jama'at policy declaring transformation political order through unconstitutional means against sharia law
even party repressed ayub khan people's party 1972 governments maududi kept party clandestine activity
until retired emir ji ji jam'iat-e tulabah became routinely involved violence
objective revolution justice `adl benevolence ihsan injustice wrong overcome focused immorality fahsha` forbidden behavior munkarat
maududi interested ethical changes rather socio-economic changes sort drive most historical revolutions revolutionary movements
support these example opposing land reform 1950 s encroachment property rights believed problems addressed solved islamic state established revolution
left least commentator vali nasr wonder maudidi any actual interest revolution ideology saw them simply buzzwords necessary indicate commitment progress justice political idealism anti-colonialist political milieu 20 th century south asia
islamic state further information islamic state modern conceptualization islamic state also attributed maududi
term coined popularized book islamic law constitution 1941 subsequent writings
maududi's islamic state both ideological all-embracing based islamic democracy will eventually rule earth
1955 described god-worshipping democratic caliphate founded guidance vouchsafed us through muhammad
ultimately though islam important state judged adherence din religion islamic system democracy
unlike islamic state ayatollah khomeini establish enforce islamisation follow islamisation society
maududi became involved politics vision relegated distant utopia
three principles underlying tawhid oneness god risala prophethood khilafa caliphate
sphere activity covered islamic state co-extensive human life
such state no regard any field affairs personal private
islamic state recognizes sovereignty god meant god source law
islamic state acts vicegerent agent god earth[quran 2455] enforces islamic law mentioned above both all-embracing totally silent vast range human affairs
while government follows sharia law comes question no explicit injunction found sharia matter settled consensus among muslims
state called caliphate caliph traditional descendant quraysh tribe maududi believed entire muslim community popular vicegerency
although there also individual leader chosen muslim community
thus state theocracy theodemocracy
maududi believed sovereignty god hakimiya sovereignty people mutually exclusive
sovereignty human beings simply domination man man source most human misery calamity
governance based sovereignty other god's does just lead inferior governance injustice maladministration evil
therefore while maududi used term democracy describe state part appeal westernized muslim intellectuals islamic democracy antithesis secular western democracy transfers hakimiya god's sovereignty people may pass laws without regard god's commands
islamic state conduct affairs mutual consultation shura among muslims
means consultation should suit conditions particular time place must free impartial
while government follows sharia law comes question no explicit injunction found sharia matter settled consensus among muslims
maududi favored giving state exclusive right power declaring jihad ijtihad establishing islamic law through independent reasoning traditionally domain ulama
rights while no aspect life considered personal private danger foreign influence conspiracies ever present nationalism example western concept divided muslim world thus prolonged supremacy western imperialist powers there also personal freedom no suspicion government
maududi's time spent jail political prisoner led personal interest individual rights due process law freedom political expression
maududi stated espionage life individual cannot justified moral grounds government saying necessary know secrets dangerous persons
exactly islam called root cause mischief politics
injunction prophet ruler begins search causes dissatisfaction amongst people spoils them abu dawud
however basic human right islamic law demand islamic order live
included any rights differ rulers defy authority
islamic constitution according maududi islam unwritten constitution needed transformed written
constitution sharia quran saudi arabia's constitution alleged religious document based conventions rightly guided caliphs canonized verdicts recognized jurists
sharia well quran hadith
model government expanding government islamic state should look like book islamic law constitution maududi took model government muhammad first four caliphs al-khulafāʾu ar-rāshidūn
head state should supreme head legislature executive judiciary alike under these three organs should function separately independently another
head state should elected must enjoy country's confidence limited terms office
no allowed nominate office nor engage electioneering run office according another source
because correct position exist pluralism
competition political views/parties allowed there party
other hand maududi believed state no need govern western sense term since government citizenry abide same infallible inviolable divine law power corrupt no feel oppressed
power resources distributed fairly
there no grievances no mass mobilizations demands political participation any other turmoil non-islamic governance
since prophet early muslims my community will never agree error there no need establishing concrete procedures mechanisms popular consultation
since state defined ideology—not boundaries ethnicity—its raison d'etre protector ideology purity must protected against any efforts subvert
naturally must controlled run exclusively muslims just any muslims those believe ideology based divine law assigned administer
state's legislature should consist body such learned men ability capacity interpret quranic injunctions giving decisions take liberties spirit letter sharia
their legislation based practice ijtihad source islamic law relying careful analogical reasoning using both qu'ran hadith find solution legal problem making legal organ political
must also persons enjoy confidence masses
may chosen modern system elections other method appropriate circumstances needs modern times
since upright character essential office holders desire office represents greed ambition anyone actively seeking office leadership automatically disqualified
non-muslims women may head state vote separate legislators
originally maududi envisioned legislature consultative body later proposed using referendum deal possible conflicts head state legislature loser referendum resigning
another later rule allowing formation parties factions during elections representatives within legislature
judiciary maududi originally proposed inquisitional system judges implement law without discussion interference lawyers saw un-islamic
after party rescued government repression pakistani judiciary changed mind supporting autonomy judiciary accepting adversarial system right appeal
failure western democracy secular western representative democracy—despite free elections civil rights—is failure maududi believed two reasons
because secular society divorced politics religion maududi believed leaders ceased attach much any importance morality ethics ignore their constituents' interests common good
furthermore without islam common people incapable perceiving their own true interests
example being prohibition law united states despite fact rationally logically established drinking injurious health produces deleterious disorder human society maududi states law banning alcohol consumption repealed american congress
non-muslims maududi believed copying cultural practices non-muslims forbidden islam having very disastrous consequences upon nation destroys inner vitality blurs vision befogs critical faculties breeds inferiority complexes gradually assuredly saps springs culture sounds death-knell
why holy prophet positively forcefully forbidden muslims assume culture mode life non-muslims
appalled saw satanic flood female liberty licence threatens destroy human civilisation west
maududi strongly opposed small ahmadiyya sect muslim sect maududi many other muslims consider muslim
preached against ahmadiyya pamphlet qadiani question book finality prophethood
under islamic state rights non-muslims limited under islamic state laid out maududi's writings
although non-muslim faith ideology rituals worship social customs interfered non-muslims accept muslim rule
islamic 'jihad' does recognize their right administer state affairs according system view islam evil
furthermore islamic 'jihad' also refuses admit their right continue such practices under islamic government fatally affect public interest viewpoint islam
non-muslims eligible kinds employment must rigorously excluded influencing policy decisions hold key posts government elsewhere
right vote presidential elections elections muslim representatives
ensure basic policy ideological state remains conformity fundamentals islam
islamic republic may however allow non-muslims elect their own representatives parliament voting separate electorates islamic republic iran
while might see discrimination islam most just most tolerant most generous political systems treatment minorities according maududi
non-muslims also pay traditional special tax known jizya
under maududi's islamic state tax applicable able-bodied non-muslim men—elderly children women being exempt—in return their exemption military service adult muslim men subject
those serve military exempted
non-muslims also barred holding certain high level offices islamic state
jizya thus seen tax paid return protection foreign invasion also symbol islamic sovereignty
jews christians
should forced pay jizya order put end their independence supremacy should remain rulers sovereigns land
these powers should wrested them followers true faith should assume sovereignty lead others towards right way
jihad maududi's first work come public attention al jihad fil-islam jihad islam serialized newspaper 1927 twenty-four
maintained because islam all-encompassing islamic state world should limited just homeland islam
jihad should used eliminate un-islamic rule establish worldwide islamic state islam wishes destroy states governments anywhere face earth opposed ideology programme islam regardless country nation rules
purpose islam set up state basis own ideology programme regardless nation assumes role standard-bearer islam rule nation undermined process establishment ideological islamic state
islam requires earth—not just portion whole planet
because entire mankind should benefit ideology welfare programme [of islam]
towards end islam wishes press service forces bring revolution composite term use these forces ‘jihad’
objective islamic ‘ jihād’ eliminate rule un-islamic system establish stead islamic system state rule
maududi taught destruction lives property others lamentable part great sacrifice jihad muslims must follow islamic principle better suffer lesser loss save ourselves greater loss
though jihad thousands lives may lost cannot compare calamity may befall mankind result victory evil over good aggressive atheism over religion god
explained jihad combat god any effort helped those waging combat qitaal including non-violent work jihad way allah active combat role battlefield nor everyone fight front line
just single battle preparations often made decades end plans deeply laid while thousands fight front line there behind them millions engaged various tasks though small themselves contribute directly supreme effort
same time took conservative line jihad other revivalist thinkers such ayatollah khomeini sayyid qutb
general argued jihad should denote crazed faith
blood-shot eyes shouting allahu akbar decapitating unbeliever wherever see cutting off heads while invoking ilaha illa-llah [there no god god]
during cease-fire india 1948 opposed waging jihad kashmir stating jihad proclaimed muslim governments religious leaders
criticism controversy political while seen supporters intellectual pioneer affirmed true islamic values
sought actualize idea islamic state society opponents criticized self-promoting preacher restrictive interpretation islam threatened pluralistic fabric pakistani civil society
opposition pakistan founder muhammed ali jinnah every government pakistan -- save general muhammad zia-ul-haq's—made dubious patriot according these critics
jama'ati party applauded time resources spent educational social welfare projects
however methods recruitment involved membership initiation pledging allegiance organization rather pakistan constitution
gave cult-like reputation led accusations critics brainwashing supporters/members

choueiri maududi's theo-democracy ideological state legislators legislate citizens vote reaffirm permanent applicability god's laws women rarely venture outside their homes lest social discipline disrupted non-muslims tolerated foreign elements required express their loyalty means paying financial levy

adams complained maududi never enters detailed discussion precise limits freedom islamic state explain how state may both control everything yet limited power certain respects
while god's sovereignty hands muslim people theory plan islamic state puts power hands ruler
maududi never provided explanation how prevent development tyranny sees secular government
ideas criticized failure solve real day-to-day problems building functional government reply defending truth islam implying muslim critics criticizing islam
adams also finds closeness lack friction ruler legislature maududi envisioned state unrealistic
ruler legislature agreement there no opposition ruler long right while entire parliament become opposition party ruler deviated straight path
maududi himself admitted visionary ideal nature much islamic state
once spoke characteristics realizable context ideal islamic society does now exist
adams criticized power maududi puts virtue vice rather political interests expertise other attributes
whenever injustice suffering exist society because leadership prefers state affairs doesn't care
will ended good pious moral muslim man implementing sharia law whatever physical social economic other difficulties society
political scientist vali nasr questions maududi's idea muslims following islam almost entirety muslim history history islam resume after fourteen-century interlude muslim follow maududi's teachings establish islamic state
nasr also questioned how popular interests popular will translated government policy without competition among political representatives popular support electioneering/campaigning votes connect leaders concerns people
conceptual level journalist author abdelwahab meddeb questions basis maududi's reasoning sovereignty truly islamic state must divine popular saying maududi constructed coherent political system follows wholly manipulation
manipulation arabic word hukm usually defined exercise power governing pronounce sentence judge two parties knowledgeable medicine philosophy wise prudent considered judgment
quran contains phrase `hukm god's alone` thus according maududi god form sharia law must govern
meddeb argues full reading ayah phrase appears reveals refers god's superiority over pagan idols role government
those whom you follow outside nothing names you your fathers given them
god granted them no authority
hukm god's alone
commanded you follow none
such right religion most people know
[quran 1240] quranic commentators never forget remind us verse devoted powerlessness companion deities pardras idolaters raise up next god… abdel meddab's view contradicted wahhabi islamic scholars such saleh al-fawzan writes accepts law other allah's ascribes partner allah
whatever act worship legislated hukam allah messenger bid‘ah every bid'ah means deviation
relations ulama maududi members party sometimes confrontation traditional scholars sometimes allies
maududi worried muslim society fallen jahiliyya pre-islamic ignorance saw himself mujaddid renewer faith
although trained islamic scholar consider himself member ulama
believed simplifying language style religious discourse educated people direct access quran sunnah seek commandments exemplification warned students religious traders ulama being led astray
particular maududi criticized former colleagues jamiat ulema-e-hind
other hand people pakistan considered focus politics sectarian doctrine lacking orthodoxy maududi himself having mahdiist pretensions
over years jama'at positions became traditionalist
first part differentiate ideas movement competing muslim reformist revivalist movements british india found himself same side ulama defending validity hadith against critics those made unorthodox interpretations them
ji founded 1941 maududi invited 75 clerics join
most ignored disapproved start-up handful younger clerics joined
joining ji members shahada traditional statement conversion islam implying ji members felt less-than-true muslims before joining
maududi's use title emir also controversial
first years after creation pakistan maududi ulama found common cause fighting secular islamic modernist policies ruling elites
also subject critical fatwas lack orthodoxy 1952 maududi ji under attack schools ulama india pakistan
campaign greatly damaged ji deobandi parts pakistan jama'at worked hard refute charges against denying departed orthodoxy blaming pakistani government
anti-maududi fatwa campaigns also erupted 1963 1966
ji started association seminary madrassa students jam'iat-i tulabah-i arabiyah own association ulama jam'iat-i ittihad-i ulama 1963 ulama academy 1976
however such attacks against maududi's work haven't affected their widespread influence islamic community nor conflict majority maududi's views
[citation needed] maududi's party very limited success uniting religious parties—the other religious parties being affiliated ulama
elections 1970 jamiat ulema-e-pakistan party contested 42 tickets there jama'at candidate harming jama'at's election results jama'at's created pakistan islamic front 1993 no other religious parties joined
mystique personality personal life jama'at amir remained close contact ji members conducting informal discussions everyday house maghrib isha'a prayers although according later years discussion replaced answers members questions any rebuttals ignored
votaries jama'at maududi revered scholar politician thinker hallowed mujaddid
adding mystic survival assassination attempts while jama'at's enemies liaquat ali khan ghulam muhammad huseyn shaheed suhrawardy ayub khan zulfikar ali bhutto fell grace killed
powerful command urdu language insisted using order free muslims minds influence english
private described strict rigid taciturn poised composed uncompromising unyielding
biographers talked karanat special gifts haybah great presence
public speaking style described having great authority
maududi make argument step-by-step islamic edicts rather attempting excite audience oratory
although publicize fact maududi practitioner traditional medicine unani tibb
family health maududi described close wife able spend much time six sons three daughters due commitments religious dawah political action
offspring ever joined ji
second daughter asma showed any scholarly promise
maududi suffered kidney ailment most life
often bedridden 1945 1946 1969 forced travel england treatment
late life april 1979 maududi's long-time kidney ailment worsened then also heart problems
went united states treatment hospitalized buffalo new york second son worked physician
following few surgical operations died september 1979 age 75
funeral held buffalo buried unmarked grave residence ichhra lahore after very large funeral procession through city

pakistan ji claims oldest religious party hard exaggerate importance country's current drift toward maududi's version islam according scholar eran lerman
