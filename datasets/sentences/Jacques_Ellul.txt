met through protestant student federation during academic school year 1929–30
early 1930 s ellul's three primary sources inspiration karl marx søren kierkegaard karl barth
ellul first introduced ideas karl marx during economics lecture course taught joseph benzacar 1929–30 ellul studied marx became prolific exegete theories
during same period also came across christian existentialism kierkegaard
according ellul marx kierkegaard two greatest influences two authors read their work
also considered karl barth leader resistance against german state church world war ii greatest theologian 20 th century
addition these intellectual influences ellul also father played great role life considered role model
these ideological influences earned both devoted followers vicious enemies
large measure especially those books concerned theological matters ellul restates viewpoints held barth whose polar dialectic word god gospel both judges renews world shaped ellul's theological perspective

[citation needed] theology while ellul perhaps most noted sociological work especially discussions technology saw theological work essential aspect career began publishing theological discussions early such books presence kingdom 1948
although son minority french reformed tradition thus spiritual heir thinkers like john calvin ulrich zwingli ellul departed substantially reformed doctrinal traditions unlike other european protestant thinkers utterly rejected influence philosophical idealism romanticism upon beliefs god human faith
articulating theological ideas mainly drew upon corpus works swiss-german theologian karl barth critiques european state christianity made dane søren kierkegaard
thus considered ardent expositors dialectical theology decline elsewhere western theological scene during ellul's heyday
much like barth ellul no use either liberal theology dominated enlightenment notions goodness humanity thus rendered puerile naïveté orthodox protestantism e
fundamentalism scholastic calvinism both refuse acknowledge radical freedom god humanity maintained roughly un-catholic view bible theology churches
particular theological movement aroused ire death god theology
within movement held conviction traditional christian conceptions god humanity arise primitive consciousness most civilized people quite overcome
line thought affirmed ethical teachings jesus rejected idea represented anything highly accomplished human being
ellul attacked school practitioners such harvey cox out accord christian doctrinal traditions reality itself namely perceived irreducible religiosity human race devotion worshiped idols such rulers nations recent times materialism scientism technology economics
ellul people use such fallen images powers substitute god turn used them no possible appeal innocence neutrality although possible theoretically does fact exist
ellul thus renovates non-legalistic manner traditional christian understanding original sin espouses thoroughgoing pessimism human capabilities view most sharply evidenced meaning city see bibliography below
ellul stated problems these new theologies “ consequence desire make message kerygma valid see men presence god increase universality lordship jesus christ insist value mankind generally detriment christian insist value world detriment church comes point denying whatever specifically christian
“ ultimate purpose whole death-of-god system justify certain kind behavior part christians relation society—a kind behavior dictated conformism modern world
justificatory formula manufactured alas often turns out theology merely amounts justification behavior pretend-christians
theology death god reinforces evil tendency
justifies sociological impulsion
kind theology really unconsciously
nor marvelous intellectual operations proponents perform every appearance seriousness make less profoundly false
ellul espouses views salvation sovereignty god ethical action appear take deliberately contrarian stance toward established mainstream opinion
instance book believe declared himself christian universalist writing people beginning time saved god jesus christ recipients grace no matter done
ellul formulated stance any liberal humanistic sympathies main extremely high view god's transcendence god totally free god pleases
any attempts modify freedom merely human standards righteousness justice amount sin putting oneself god's place precisely adam eve sought creation myths genesis
highly unusual juxtaposition original sin universal salvation repelled liberal conservative critics commentators alike charge such views amount antinomianism denying god's laws binding upon human beings
most theologically-oriented writings ellul effectively dismisses those charges stemming radical confusion religions human phenomena unique claims christian faith predicated upon human achievement moral integrity whatsoever
“ bible however find god escapes us totally whom absolutely cannot influence dominate much less punish god reveals himself wants reveal himself god very often place expected god truly beyond our grasp
thus human religious feeling satisfied situation
god descends humanity joins us
presence faith jesus christ alters reality
also believe hope no way escape future active force now love leads us deeper understanding reality
love probably most realistic possible understanding our existence
contrary reality itself

ellul set forth seven characteristics modern technology make efficiency necessity rationality artificiality automatism technical choice self-augmentation monism universalism autonomy
rationality technique enforces logical mechanical organization through division labor setting production standards etc
creates artificial system eliminates subordinates natural world
regarding technology instead being subservient humanity human beings adapt accept total change
example ellul offered diminished value humanities technological society
people begin question value learning ancient languages history question those things surface little advance their financial technical state
according ellul misplaced emphasis problems modern education produces situation immense stress placed information our schools
focus those schools prepare young people enter world information able work computers knowing their reasoning their language their combinations connections them
movement invading whole intellectual domain also conscience
ellul's commitment scrutinize technological development expressed such “ [w]hat issue here evaluating danger might happen our humanity present half-century distinguishing want keep ready lose welcome legitimate human development should reject our last ounce strength dehumanization
cannot think choices kind unimportant
sacred then classically defined object both hope fear both fascination dread
once nature all-encompassing environment power upon human beings dependent life death experienced sacred
reformation desacralized church name bible bible became sacred book
since then scientism through charles darwin's theory evolution reason higher criticism liberal theology desacralized scriptures sciences particularly those applied sciences amenable aims collective economic production capitalist socialist communist elevated position sacred western culture
today argues technological society generally held sacred cf
saint steve jobs
since defines technique totality methods rationally arrived having absolute efficiency given stage development every field human activity clear sociological analysis focuses society machines such society efficient techniques “ modern technology become total phenomenon civilization defining force new social order efficiency no longer option necessity imposed human activity
useless argues think distinction made technique use techniques specific social psychological consequences independent human desires

best cease good technicians
end technique principle efficient ordering
anarchy violence ellul identified himself christian anarchist
ellul explained view way anarchy mean first absolute rejection violence
jesus socialist anarchist want stress here regard anarchism fullest most serious form socialism
meant nation-states primary sources violence modern era should neither praised nor feared continually questioned challenged
ellul human government largely irrelevant revelation god contained scripture sufficient exclusive
being christian means pledging absolute allegiance christ makes other laws redundant best counter revelation god worst
despite initial attraction evangelicals thinking because high view biblical texts
generally eschewing historical-critical method position alienated conservative protestants
later attract following among adherents ethically-compatible traditions such anabaptists house church movement
similar political ideas ellul's appear writings corresponding friend american william stringfellow long-time admirer vernard eller author christian anarchy
ellul identified state political power beast book revelation
jacques ellul discusses anarchy few pages ethics freedom[page needed] detail within later work anarchy & christianity
although does admit anarchy does seem direct expression christian freedom concludes absolute power sees within current nation-state responded absolute negative position
states intention establish anarchist society total destruction state
initial point anarchy & christianity led toward anarchy commitment absolute rejection violence
however ellul does entertain idea christians places times will refrain violence
rather insisted violence reconciled god love thus true freedom
christian chooses path violence must admit she abandoning path freedom committing way necessity
during spanish civil war spanish anarchist friends ellul's soon-to-be wife came france search weapons
tried get them through old school friend claimed probably time life sufficiently motivated commit act violence
go anarchists primarily because recently met woman become wife wish leave her
ellul states subversion christianity thinks biblical teaching clear
contests political power
incites 'counterpower' 'positive' criticism irreducible dialogue like king prophet israel antistatism decentralizing relation extreme relativizing everything political anti-ideology questioning claims either power dominion other words things political finally may use modern term kind anarchism long relate term anarchist teaching nineteenth century
ellul states violence idealism serves justify use violence including revolutionary idealism viewing violence means end and/or violence under mask legality generous idealism leading violence toward reconciliation and/or blindness violence one's enemy “
there generous idealism many young men risk imprisonment death rather participate war condemn because idealize whitewash their country's enemy
those young men heroes fools both
repelled violence see—the massive enormous violence cries heaven
seeing highly visible violence forthwith make lambs saints martyrs victims
close their eyes enemy really like cruelty violence lies
overlook real intentions overlook fact use terrible violence won power
poor young men totally unknowing uncomprehending blind perceiving happening now! side enemy countenance enemy's violence
france before second world war great many people sided nazis
hadn't nazis out their generosity protested against violence done sudeten germans croats germans danzig? hadn't declared defend rights poor unemployed victims exploited capitalists? their admiration nazis cost those people dearly
again after war many french people sided communism 'the party poor proletariat
few years later stunned declarations twentieth communist congress moscow's suppression hungarian revolt
kind idealism must combated radically condemned
pacifist idealism beliefs lifestyles possible within larger violence-based society 4
christian idealism concerned moral goodness human world
leads concepts progressiveness unreserved participation good conscience political scientific action
their idyllic world harshness torture war seem abnormal almost incomprehensible
gross highly visible undeniable violence evokes scandalized reaction
deny existence masked secret covert violence—insofar concealed
justice ellul believed social justice true freedom incompatible
rejected any attempt reconcile them
believed christian choose join movement justice doing must admit fight justice necessarily same time fight against forms freedom
while social justice provides guarantee against risk bondage simultaneously subjects life necessities
ellul believed christian decides act must way specifically christian
christians must never identify themselves political economic movement
rather must bring social movements alone provide
signalize kingdom
far act like others—even forward social justice equality etc
—i say there no sense nothing specifically christian acting like others
fact political revolutionary attitude proper christian radically different attitude others specifically christian else nothing
violence ellul states belief god able establish justice god alone will institute kingdom end time
acknowledges used excuse nothing also points out how death-of-god advocates use claim ourselves must undertake establish social justice
ellul maintained without belief traditional judeo-christian conception god love pursuit justice becomes selective relation left horizontal
ellul asks how define justice claims followers death-of-god theology and/or philosophy clung matthew 25 stating justice requires them feed poor
ellul says many european christians rushed socialist circles began accept movement's tactics violence propaganda etc
mistakenly thinking socialism assure justice fact pursues justice chosen and/or interesting poor whose condition victim capitalism other socialist enemy consistent socialist ideology
76–77 “
jesus christ come establish social justice any come establish power state reign money art
jesus christ come save men matters men may come know
adept finding reasons-good theological political practical reasons camouflaging
real reason let ourselves impressed dominated forces world press public opinion political game appeals justice liberty peace poverty third world christian civilization west play our inclinations weaknesses
modern protestants main prepared things men like st
paul unfortunately order may save order may like men
254–255 ellul states subversion christianity proclaim class conflict 'classical' revolutionary struggle stop same point those defend their goods organizations
may useful socially christian spite disconcerting efforts theologies revolution
revelation demands renunciation-the renunciation illusions historic hopes references our own abilities numbers sense justice
tell people thus increase their awareness offense ruling classes trying blind deaden awareness those whom dominate
renounce everything order everything
trust no human means god will provide cannot say how
confidence word rational program
enter way you will gradually find answers no guaranteed substance
difficult much recruiting guerillas instigating terrorism stirring up masses
why gospel intolerable intolerable myself speak say myself others intolerable readers shrug their shoulders
“ disciples wanted their preaching effective recruit good people move crowds launch movement made message material
formulated material goals economic social political spheres
stirred people up easy way
declare however kingdom world freedom achieved revolt rebellion serves no purpose there neither nor will any paradise earth there no social justice justice resides god comes look responsibility culpability others first ourselves ask defeat say intolerable things
media propaganda information ellul discusses these topics detail landmark work propaganda formation men's attitudes
viewed power media another example technology exerting control over human destiny
mechanism change media almost invariably manipulated special interests whether market state
also within propaganda ellul claims fact excessive data enlighten reader listener drown
cannot remember them coordinate them understand them does want risk losing mind will merely draw general picture them
facts supplied simplistic image
additionally people become caught web facts given
cannot even form choice judgment other areas other subjects
thus mechanisms modern information induce sort hypnosis individual cannot get out field laid out information
true choose freely regard presented truth
because rational propaganda thus creates irrational situation remains above propaganda—that inner control over individual social force means deprives himself
ellul agreed jules monnerot stated individual passion leads suppression critical judgment regard object passion
“ individual burns desire action does know common type our society
wants act sake justice peace progress does know how
propaganda show 'how' then won game action will surely follow
response invitation protestant associations ellul visited germany twice 1934 1935
second visit attended nazi meeting out curiosity influenced later work propaganda ability unify group
throw wager secular faith boldest possible relief ellul places dialectical contrast biblical faith
dialectical contrast technique instance ellul writes sans feu ni lieu published 1975 although written much earlier
humanism explaining significance freedom purpose resisting enslavement humans via acculturation sociological bondage ellul rejects notion due supposed supreme importance linked humanity
states modern enslavement expresses how authority signification value attached humanity beliefs institutions creates
leads exaltation nation state money technology art morality party etc
work humanity glorified worshiped while simultaneously enslaving humankind
man himself exalted paradoxical though may seem means crushing man
man's enslavement reverse side glory value importance ascribed
society magnifies human greatness will see men alienated enslaved imprisoned tortured
humanism prepares ground anti-human
say intellectual paradox
need read history
men never oppressed societies set man pinnacle values exalt greatness make measure things
such societies freedom detached purpose affirm glory god
“ before god am human being
am caught situation there truly radically no escape spider's web cannot break
am continue living human being someone must come free me
other words god trying humiliate me
mortally affronted situation my humanity my dignity
my pride vainglorious declaration myself
cannot accept
our own eyes declare ourselves righteous free
want grace
fundamentally want self-justification
there thus commences patient work reinterpreting revelation make christianity will glorify humanity humanity will able take credit own righteousness
