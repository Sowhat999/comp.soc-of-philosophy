political philosophy main article anarchy state utopia anarchy state utopia 1974 nozick received national book award category philosophy religion
there nozick argues minimal state limited narrow functions protection against force theft fraud enforcement contracts justified without violating people's rights
nozick distribution goods just brought free exchange among consenting adults just starting position even large inequalities subsequently emerge process
nozick appealed kantian idea people should treated ends termed 'separateness persons' merely means other end
nozick challenged partial conclusion john rawls' second principle justice theory justice social economic inequalities arranged greatest benefit least-advantaged members society
anarchy state utopia claims heritage john locke's second treatise government seeks ground itself upon natural law doctrine reaches importantly different conclusions locke himself several ways
most controversially nozick argued consistent upholding non-aggression principle allow regard valid consensual non-coercive enslavement contracts adults
rejected notion inalienable rights advanced locke most contemporary capitalist-oriented libertarian academics writing anarchy state utopia typical notion free system allow adults voluntarily enter non-coercive slave contracts
epistemology philosophical explanations 1981 received phi beta kappa society's ralph waldo emerson award nozick provided novel accounts knowledge free will personal identity nature value meaning life
also put forward epistemological system attempted deal both gettier problem those posed skepticism
highly influential argument eschewed justification necessary requirement knowledge
7 nozick's four conditions s's knowing p p true s believes p case not-p s believe p case p s believe p nozick's third fourth conditions counterfactuals
called tracking theory knowledge
nozick believed counterfactual conditionals bring out important aspect our intuitive grasp knowledge any given fact believer's method must reliably track truth despite varying relevant conditions
way nozick's theory similar reliabilism
due certain counterexamples otherwise raised against these counterfactual conditions nozick specified p weren’t case s use m arrive belief whether p then s wouldn’t believe via m p
p case s use m arrive belief whether p then s believe via m p
m stands method s came arrive belief whether p
major criticism nozick's theory knowledge rejection principle deductive closure
principle states s knows x s knows x implies then s knows
nozick's truth tracking conditions allow principle deductive closure
nozick believes truth tracking conditions fundamental human intuition principle deductive closure
unlike many epistemologists nozick does attempt disprove skeptic
instead qualifies using truth tracking theory knowledge
example skeptic may argue cannot know brain vat
nozick argues know brain vat
simultaneously argues another sense know brain vat
specifically uses g
moore's here hand thought experiment
assume true belief hands
furthermore nearby possible worlds continues hands continues hands
moreover nearby possible worlds no longer hands stop believing hands
thus know hands
nonetheless nozick admits cannot overcome skeptic
assuming actually brain vat third condition cannot satisfied
other words does stop believing brain vat nearby possible worlds vatted brain
does know brain vat then know hands
thus nozick argues know hands also know handless brain vat
later books examined life 1989 pitched broader public explores love death faith reality meaning life
according stephen metcalf nozick expresses serious misgivings capitalist libertarianism going far reject much foundations theory grounds personal freedom sometimes fully actualized via collectivist politics wealth times justly redistributed via taxation protect freedom many potential tyranny overly selfish powerful few
nozick suggests citizens opposed wealth redistribution fund programs object should able opt out supporting alternative government approved charities added 5% surcharge
however jeff riggenbach noted
interview conducted july 2001 stated never stopped self-identifying libertarian
roderick long reports last book invariances [nozick] identified voluntary cooperation 'core principle' ethics maintaining duty interfere another person's 'domain choice' '[a]ll any society should coercively demand' higher levels ethics involving positive benevolence represent instead 'personal ideal' should left 'a person's own individual choice development
certainly sounds like attempt embrace libertarianism over again
my own view nozick's thinking these matters evolved over time any given time accurate reflection thinking time
nature rationality 1993 presents theory practical reason attempts embellish notoriously spartan classical decision theory
socratic puzzles 1997 collection papers range topic ayn rand austrian economics animal rights
thesis claims social ties deeply interconnected vital parts nozick's later philosophy citing these two works development examined life
last production invariances 2001 applies insights physics biology questions objectivity such areas nature necessity moral value
utilitarianism nozick created thought experiment utility monster show average utilitarianism lead situation needs vast majority sacrificed individual
also version essentially previously-known thought experiment experience machine attempt show ethical hedonism false
nozick asked us imagine superduper neuropsychologists figured out way stimulate person's brain induce pleasurable experiences
210–11 able tell these experiences real
asks us given choice choose machine-induced experience wonderful life over real life? nozick says no then asks whether reasons plug machine concludes since does seem rational plug ethical hedonism must false
unusual philosophical method nozick notable exploratory style philosophizing methodological ecumenism
often content raise tantalizing philosophical possibilities then leave judgment reader nozick also notable drawing literature outside philosophy e
economics physics evolutionary biology
