received ph electrical engineering columbia 1949 became assistant professor next year
zadeh taught ten years columbia promoted full professor 1957 taught university california berkeley since 1959
published seminal work fuzzy sets 1965 detailed mathematics fuzzy set theory
1973 proposed theory fuzzy logic
personal life beliefs zadeh noted quick shrug off nationalism insisting there much deeper issues life quoted stating interview question really isn't whether i'm american russian iranian azerbaijani anything else
i've shaped these people cultures feel quite comfortable among them
zadeh also notes same interview obstinacy tenacity
being afraid get embroiled controversy
that's very much turkish tradition
that's part my character too
very stubborn
that's probably beneficial development fuzzy logic

work according google scholar september 2015 zadeh's work cited 150852 times 1965 fuzzy sets paper receiving 58251
fuzzy sets systems zadeh theory fuzzy sets proposed using membership function range covering interval operating domain possible values
proposed new operations calculus logic showed fuzzy logic generalisation classical boolean logic
also proposed fuzzy numbers special case fuzzy sets well corresponding rules consistent mathematical operations fuzzy arithmetic
other contributions lotfi zadeh also credited along john r
ragazzini 1952 having pioneered development z-transform method discrete time signal processing analysis
these methods now standard digital signal processing digital control other discrete-time systems used industry research
