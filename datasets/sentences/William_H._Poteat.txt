understand teaching william poteat important realize sought primarily accomplish—specifically teaching generally intellectual endeavors—according those most closely associated ph
no ordinary matter conveying information understanding nor helping students gain mastery difficult ideas texts turn position help their students gain such mastery—although these tasks unavoidably involved
primary aim teaching provoke students fundamental shift sensibility perspective mode critical intellection reflection characterizes modernity predominates academic world michael polanyi called post-critical mode thinking
instead attending solely topic item content teaching matter subjected intellectual mastery critique indifferent object thought shift involves becoming aware how intellection itself — specifically how one's responsive relationship person world object thought—of how personally happens relating oneself
how intellection how one's personal relation object thought—in other words underlying relationship knower known—is predominantly tacit difficult articulate therefore something easily reflect causes potentially consequential process knowing
poteat polanyi understood post-critical mode thinking essential corrective natural successor critical approach thinking knowing tends lose track how knowing while presuming relationship hypercritical suspicion guarded distance objectification achieve objective knowledge personal presence involvement withheld repressed
presuming personal involvement process knowing illegitimate because thought adulterate objectivity known features knowledge result personal participation drop out resulting conception including most notably presence subject doing knowing indwelling context discerning facts knowing
their view critical mode thinking operates under unacknowledged presumption such depersonalized relationship result unadulterated truth
consequence most part oblivious distortions attendant such impoverished reductive relationship
idolization objectivity critical perspective tends lose entirely contributions knowing come through personal presence mindbodily participation empathy caring thoughtful hospitality sensitive thoughtful interpretation — aspects poteat polanyi refer indwelling
thus critical mode devaluing becoming oblivious intimate connections how generally underlying tacit relationship knower known leaves place colorless purposeless meaningless world objects subject unchecked manipulation
poteat's own words perennial temptation critical thought demand total explicitness things bring background foreground dissolve tension focal subsidiary making everything focal dilute temporal intentional thickness perception dehistoricize thought
lighten every shadowy place dig up aerate roots our being make interiors exterior unsituate reflection time space disincarnate mind define knowledge grasped thought absolutely lucid 'moment' without temporal extension flatten out epistemic hierarchy homogenize logical heterogeneity poteat demonstrated students making shift post-critical mode thinking requires escaping largely subconscious profoundly self-alienating abstractedness critical mode — default mode modernity
able break free taught way cleared one's authentic self fully present authentic selves others things world concerned
happen acute awareness those self-alienating tendencies their tragic consequences must developed
place hypercritical suspicion driving central motive thought comes share post-critical sensibility centered recovery passionate methodological faith tacit intimations reality truth common reveals itself inexhaustibly
also one's understanding oneself knower shifts former split now recognized illusionary subjective knower outside world depersonalized object knowledge among objects unified mindbodily knower deeply richly implicated within natural cultural world alongside other persons
poteat accomplished pedagogical feat through combination ironic stance whereby deliberately made impossible any simple straightforward taking might convey skillful use socratic method question draw out bring light implications students' own thoughts ideas text under consideration issues raised
poteat typically conducted process discovery reorientation during seminar discussions certain assigned texts often relation each other
although others included time time central core key texts included polanyi's personal knowledge wittgenstein's philosophical investigations certainty merleau-ponty's phenomenology perception hannah arendt's human condition selection kierkegaard's works particularly essay immediate stages erotic musical erotic either/or vol
those books their authors undertook radical critique prepossessions european enlightenment concerning nature human knowing doing
later life described principal focus teaching effort following words [it was] sustained critical colloquy three generations graduate students set among half-dozen canonical volumes context our mutual search imagination's way out walker percy called old modern age
my students measure truly joined colloquy outset aspired radically critical critical tradition modernity say undertaken become postcritical
like any parasite essentially polemical convivium battened host hoping weaken eventually bring down rather modestly change universities formed whose sufferance lived
least those us sustained colloquy hoped changed
example profound confusion poteat cited texts assigned noted patricia lewis poteat's commentary percy walker percy old modern age reflections language argument telling stories
percy's conceptual vision becomes progressively blurred style vocabulary become progressively less anecdotal narrative analytical abstract — hence ever anchored concrete particulars persons predicaments she suggests essays often falls very cartesian dualism fiction condemns
another example vividly illustrating poteat's pedagogy comes araminta stone johnson self-described bill poteat's 'last' students' thanks everything poteat! intellectual personal autobiography polanyi society journal tradition discovery ricoeur's freud philosophy
ponderous tome assigned reading first class poteat
thing ricouer doing poteat wanted us experience just see ricoeur's not-so-latent cartesianism
poteat convinced order us know something different cartesian water swam necessary us struggle struggle
because struggled
poteat my fellow students later see same pattern [other works]
although poteat drew heavily small core texts teaching methodology particularly duke teaching ranged over very wide scope incorporate most aspects history western culture renaissance visual art tragedy ancient greek culture interaction greek hebrew metaphysics existentialism ordinary language philosophy theory myth symbol religious language philosophy science phenomenology philosophical psychology philosophical anthropology
contrast close powerful relationships students fellow professor duke's religion department whose career there overlapped poteat's robert osborn reports no comparable relationships faculty colleagues my colleagues duke university recognized bill impressive remarkable man
attractive person — brilliant widely read very charming even winsome scintillating intellectual
however mystery
don’t think any us department religion knew began know
during time us—some 27 years
— never heard story
spent little time department precincts except meetings students mandated department meetings chaired considerable success
otherwise minimally present
attend meetings american academy religion regional national even colleagues performing
short really colleague sense normally think colleague
bill first finally teacher
writing ideas william poteat known original thinker also extraordinarily agile — conversation teaching writing
consequently many ideas start draw upon build upon ideas other thinkers develop them ways might surprised their originators
previously indicated students often amazed discover implied presupposed their own ideas ways might never come light poteat drawn them out usually while withholding own opinions subject enable students develop their own ways
times wasn't clear student whether there difference her own ideas poteat's
similar process work during class discussion published writing poteat presented explored ideas wittgenstein polanyi merleau-ponty among many others
poteat times call attention certain ideas particular thinker point their tension conflict other ideas same thinker another point comment example polanyi evidently realize saying meant say should being true polanyi's deepest insight point other point
poteat extraordinarily alert ambiguities nuances language mentored students developing similar alertness themselves
although awareness subtle ambiguity facilitates full comprehension idea produces tendency found many published works sometimes also students' writing parenthetically qualify explain precise sense word phrase midst otherwise long complex sentence sometimes two three times single convoluted sentence
other hand poteat often took convinced these writers' key insights appropriating himself drew implications developed far beyond original writer made — especially evident book polanyian meditations
claimed their insight own rather sought aid their insight achieve greater understanding realities sought articulate their deeper implications
such idea derived both michael polanyi maurice merleau-ponty poteat's conception mindbody term coined persons neither simply minds bodies nor simply bodies minds especially manner descartes conceived them extended matter immaterial consciousness
instead persons mindbodies both minds bodies once same inextricable every aspect such mind body taken separately reflection seriously distorting abstractions whole person pre-reflectively
according poteat one's mindbody one's place world oriented whence one's activities place means relation other places things make any sense
other words mindbody sentient motile oriented self — active center every person's life
very brief review poteat’s account mindbody david w
rutledge writes through own phenomenological examination bodily being thinking writing bike-riding playing tennis poteat reveals insidious tendency critical tradition make us think our body thing like other things fact us radically unlike anything else universe
center our stretching forth toward world commences beginning my mother’s womb within her beating heart rhythmically pumps blood life through my foetal body forming itself toward my primal initiation very foundation my first most primitive cosmos
these forms me even still conscious reflective critical me archetypically forms measured time tempo beat strophe pulse
there then archaic prejudice far older my pre-reflective unreflecting mindbody indwell form meaning order world kindred first order known order my mother’s beating heart
ground human notions order measure “connectedness” “hanging together” logic lies prelingual level awareness inescapably ours never leaves us articulations higher thought educed
else human sense pattern order rhythm come long before formal reflection already immersed world gave us meaning?
clear tonic mindbody omnipresent inalienable matrix within our acts meaning-discernment conceived brought term say new picture ourselves beings world actively engaged asking seeking finding affirming clearly situates us moil ruck world’s temporal thickness marinating there our own carnal juices then our rationality appear here inextricably consanguine our most primitive sentience motility orientation
another poteat’s significant ideas touched last quotation support poteat’s polanyian meditations search post-critical logic dedicated explicitly formal modes rationality—including logic mathematics geometry computer processing—and wonderfully useful things endow us our technocratic world ultimately rooted grounded pre-reflectively lived flesh our mindbodies world—not any sense compromise their validity enabling power their meaning coherence
poteat’s own words argue therefore contrary subtly pervasive “picture” regnant cartesianism culture conceptually estranges thought our minds thought our bodies formalized rationality—mathematics formal logic—derives remains parasitical upon “hanging togetherness” “sense-making” our integral mindbodily rootedness yet unreflected world our unreflected “thinkings” doings world
course means mix among our uses such concepts ‘reason’ ‘logic’ ‘body’ ‘mind’ mention will come drastically revised
among most significant ideas poteat made own starting idea another thinker concept post-critical already discussed several times article
phrase post-critical poteat drew directly michael polanyi’s personal knowledge towards post-critical philosophy 1958 poteat discovered polanyi meant substantially akin shifts thinking advocated under other names other philosophical critics modern intellectual culture—specifically critics critical mode thinking come dominate culture particularly academy
chief among these critics poteat addition polanyi pascal kierkegaard wittgenstein merleau-ponty arendt
different ways sought move beyond break critical intellectual sensibility defined intellectual thinking since enlightenment period
articulated originally rené descartes critical mode inquiry seeks arrive undistorted truth filtering one's encounter reality through lens extreme suspicion doubt—specifically toward each every candidate belief require rendered clearly distinctly explicit therewith prove itself undoubtable before granting credence
course calls question things taken granted unreflectively things passed tradition things held matter faith deliverances our sense experience commonsense judgments—especially things uncertain indefinite non-explicit
since emergence predominant epistemic paradigm modern era taken central component method modern science critical mode assailed many thinkers mentioned previously especially polanyi breeding pervasive skepticism toward higher-order realities ideals meanings alleged realities traditionally associated arts humanities
result inherent meaning purpose value thus filtered out allowed make up objective reality surviving apparently baseless projections human subjectivity no wonder great numbers people within our culture suffered continue suffer rootlessness nihilism despair
view poteat polanyi post-critical designates shift critical mode profound recognition something quite different heart genuine intellectual inquiry something unrecognized unrecognizable critical mode
place suspicion doubt there tacit methodological faith—which say intellectual passion—to discover truth make sense things
recognize embrace shift poteat realized requires intellectual breakthrough existential transformation detached withdrawn withheld faith passion pouring forth one's personal presence empathy creative powers actively reaching out apprehend indwell intimations truth yet undisclosed realities whatever field inquiry
distinctive philosophical methodologies employed poteat teaching particularly later writing closely akin writers especially merleau-ponty phenomenology perception called existential phenomenology just phenomenology
poteat recognized merleau-ponty's practice existential phenomenology means appropriating existentially edmund husserl’s shift husserl called natural standpoint third-person abstractive account supposedly objective world material objects our body supposedly being them confident embracing concrete pre-reflective lifeworld know within our lived body
existential phenomenology merleau-ponty way wonders lifeworld adequately described understood fundamental any abstract conceptions deriving natural standpoint
poteat recognized shift transition merleau-ponty via practice existential phenomenology another instance shift critical post-critical
rather pursuing methodology systematically phenomenologists attempted poteat’s teaching writing describes brings our notice normally tacit aspects our mindbodily being world usually reflectively aware able articulate
very abstractedness our usual patterns thinking our habituated modern fixation upon made explicit keep us unaware such aspects experience without reality whole cannot apprehended nor experience comprehended
poteat seeks us awaken those tacit aspects then appropriate them extensions ourselves grounding us reflectively our own mindbodily being world
others among poteat's principal ideas include dialectic self- absence self-presence
recovery responsibly owning up oneself incarnate person among persons linking profoundly key emphases christian jewish existentialism their roots traditions spirituality their source
fact human beings merely animals gift language first primarily speech persons come being realize ourselves through language speech
resources reflexive self-reference language particularly first-person singular nominative pronoun other reflexive pronouns paradigmatic means identiifying owning up tacit personal presence center responsibility
metaphorical intentionalities words gestures our culture extend our mindbodily powers make reflective sense our experience yet simultaneously render us captive specific ways construe world ourselves within it—captivating us within picture wittgenstein's phrase picture held us captive
concrete places here one's mindbody experienced pre-reflectively versus modernity's abstract homogenized space spatial location
concrete temporality manifold particular pretensions retrotensions one's temporal being shifting present moment one's mindbody experienced pre-reflectively versus modernity's abstract homogenized clock-time
increasing dominance our culture visual sensorium versus specifically auditory sensorium tendency objectify exteriorize our sensibility prevailing since advent renaissance art culture print literacy
