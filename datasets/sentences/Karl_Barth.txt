barth featured cover april 20 1962 issue time magazine indication influence reached out academic ecclesiastical circles mainstream american religious culture
theology trinitarian focus major objective barth recover doctrine trinity theology putative loss liberalism
argument follows idea god object god's own self-knowledge revelation bible means self-unveiling humanity god cannot discovered humanity simply through own intuition
election most influential controversial features barth's dogmatics doctrine election church dogmatics ii/2
barth's theology entails rejection idea god chose each person either saved damned based purposes divine will impossible know why god chose others
barth's doctrine election involves firm rejection notion eternal hidden decree
keeping christo-centric methodology barth argues ascribe salvation damnation humanity abstract absolute decree make part god final definitive god's saving act jesus christ
god's absolute decree may speak such thing god's gracious decision humanity person jesus christ
drawing earlier reformed tradition barth retains notion double predestination makes jesus himself object both divine election reprobation simultaneously jesus embodies both god's election humanity god's rejection human sin
while regard revision doctrine election improvement augustinian-calvinist doctrine predestination individuals critics namely brunner charged barth's view amounts soft universalism thereby departing augustinian-calvinism
barth’s doctrine objective atonement develops distances himself anselm canterbury’s doctrine atonement
epistle romans barth endorses anselm’s idea god robbed honor must punish those robbed
church dogmatics i/2 barth advocates divine freedom incarnation support anselm’s cur deus homo
barth holds anselm’s doctrine atonement preserves both god’s freedom necessity christ’s incarnation
positive endorsement anselmian motives cur deus homo continues church dogmatics ii/1
barth maintains anselm sin humanity cannot removed merciful act divine forgiveness alone
church dogmatics iv/1 however barth’s doctrine atonement diverges anselm
over-christologizing doctrine barth completes formulation objective atonement
finalizes necessity god’s mercy place anselm firmly establishes dignity freedom will god
barth’s view god’s mercy identified god’s righteousness distinctive way god’s mercy takes initiative
change barth’s reception anselm’s doctrine atonement shows barth’s doctrine entails support universalism
salvation barth argued previous perspectives sin salvation influenced strict calvinist thinking sometimes misled christians thinking predestination set up humanity such vast majority human beings foreseen disobey reject god damnation coming them matter fate
barth's view salvation centrally christological writings stating jesus christ reconciliation mankind god essentially already taken place through christ man already elect justified
though advocate christian universalism strictly speaking barth asserted eternal salvation everyone even those reject god possibility isn't just open question should hoped christians matter grace specifically even though theological consistency might seem lead our thoughts utterances most clearly direction must arrogate ourselves given received free gift just hoping total reconciliation
barth words later scholar went significant step beyond traditional theology argued against conservative strains protestant christianity damnation seen absolute certainly many most people
barth christ's grace central
understanding mary main article karl barth's views mary unlike many protestant theologians barth topic mariology theological study mary
barth's views subject agreed much roman catholic dogma disagreed catholic veneration mary

through jesus mary mother god
barth liberals fundamentalists desk karl barth's old office painting matthias grünewald’s crucifixion scene
although barth's theology rejected german protestant liberalism theology usually found favour those other end theological spectrum confessionalists fundamentalists
doctrine word god instance holds christ word god does proceed arguing proclaiming bible must uniformly historically scientifically accurate then establishing other theological claims foundation
fundamentalist critics joined liberals referring barth neo-orthodox because while theology retains most tenets their understanding christianity seen rejecting belief linchpin their theological system biblical inerrancy
such critics believe written text must considered historically accurate verifiable see barth's view separation theological truth historical truth
barth respond saying claim foundation theology biblical inerrancy use foundation other jesus christ our understanding scripture's accuracy worth properly emerge consideration means true witness incarnate word jesus
relationship barth liberalism fundamentalism goes far beyond issue inerrancy however
barth's perspective liberalism understood sense 19 th century friedrich schleiermacher hegel leading exponents necessarily expressed any particular political ideology divinization human thinking
inevitably leads philosophical concepts become false god thus attempting block true voice living god
turn leads captivity theology human ideology
barth's theology emphasizes again again human concepts any kind breadth narrowness quite beside point never considered identical god's revelation
aspect scripture also written human language bears witness self-revelation god jesus christ
scripture cannot considered identical god's self-revelation properly jesus christ
however freedom love god truly reveals himself through human language concepts view toward their necessity reaching fallen humanity
thus barth claims christ truly presented scripture preaching church echoing stand expressed native swiss reformed church's helvetic confession 16 th century
opposes any attempts closely relate theology philosophy although barth consistently insists anti-philosophical
approach respect predominantly christocentric thus termed kerygmatic opposed apologetic
influence christian ethics among many other areas barth also profound influence modern christian ethics
influenced work ethicists such stanley hauerwas john howard yoder jacques ellul oliver o'donovan
relationship charlotte von kirschbaum charlotte von kirschbaum barth's secretary theological assistant three decades
barth first met charlotte von kirschbaum 1924 already married 12 years 1929 von kirschbaum moved barth family household included wife nelly five children

while nelly supplied household children von kirschbaum barth shared academic relationship
