objections council illustrated 1911 roman missal reprint 1884 edition
questioning validity second vatican council continues contending point rejection conflict among various religious communities full communion roman catholic church
particular two schools thought may discerned traditionalist catholics claim modernising reforms resulted both directly indirectly council consequently brought detrimental effects heretical acts indifference customs beliefs pious practices church before 1962
addition say there doctrinal contradiction council earlier papal statements regarding faith morals doctrine declared prior council itself
addition claim council decentralised previous notion catholic church's supremacy over other religions while demoralising longstanding pious practices religiosity
assert since there no dogmatic proclamations defined within documents council such documents infallible therefore canonically binding faithful roman catholics most notably such concilliar documents give way say loose implementation longstanding upheld catholic doctrine previously sanctioned former popes prior 1962
light most traditionalist catholics often exclusively adhere 1917 code canon law
[c] sedevacantists go beyond asserting after breaking catholic tradition espousing heresy present popes forward cannot legitimately claim papacy therefore remains vacant until another papal claimant formally abandons vatican ii council re-establishes former traditional norms prior 1962
most recent edition 1983 code canon law states catholics may disregard teaching ecumenical council even does propose such definitive
accordingly also maintains present living pope alone judges criterion membership being communio church
present canon law further articulates although assent faith religious submission intellect will must given doctrine supreme pontiff college bishops declares concerning faith morals exercise authentic magisterium even intend proclaim definitive act therefore christian faithful take care avoid those things agree

spirit vatican ii often meant promoting teachings intentions attributed second vatican council ways limited literal readings documents spoken letter council cf
saint paul's phrase letter kills spirit gives life
spirit vatican ii invoked great variety ideas attitudes
bishop john tong hon hong kong used regard merely openness dialogue others saying guided spirit vatican ii dialogue negotiation solve conflicts
contrast michael novak described spirit
sometimes soared far beyond actual hard-won documents decisions vatican ii
… though world least history church now divided two periods pre-vatican ii post-vatican ii
everything 'pre' then pretty much dismissed far authority mattered
most extreme catholic now meant believe less anything wished believe least sense personally interpreted
catholic 'in spirit'
take catholic mean 'culture' born rather mean creed making objective rigorous demands
imagine rome distant irrelevant anachronism embarrassment even adversary
rome 'them'
such views second vatican council condemned church's hierarchy works theologians active council closely adhered council's aspect reform such hans küng often criticized church espousing belief system hierarchy considers radical misguided
