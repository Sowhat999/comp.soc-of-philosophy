early manuscript vygotsky argued formation general psychology unite naturalist objectivist strands psychological science philosophical approaches marxist orientation
however also harshly criticized those colleagues attempted build marxist psychology alternative naturalist philosophical schools
argued wanted build truly marxist psychology there no shortcuts found merely looking applicable quotes marx' writings
rather should look methodology accordance marxian spirit
1926-30 vygotsky worked research programme investigating development higher cognitive functions logical memory selective attention decision making language comprehension early forms primal psychological functions
during period gathered group collaborators including alexander luria leonid sakharov boris varshava alexei leontiev leonid zankov several others
vygotsky guided students researching phenomenon three different angles instrumental angle tried understand ways humans use objects aides mediation memory reasoning
developmental approach focusing how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development
culture-historical approach studying ways forms mediation developmental trajectories shaped different social cultural patterns interaction
early 1930 s vygotsky experienced deep crisis personal theoretical after period massive self-criticism made attempt radical revision theory
work representatives gestalt psychology other holistic scholars instrumental theoretical shift
1932-1934 vygotsky aiming establishing psychological theory consciousness theory because death remained very sketchy unfinished form
life scientific legacy vygotsky pioneering psychologist major works span six separate volumes written over roughly 10 years psychology art 1925 thought language [or thinking speech] 1934
vygotsky's interests fields developmental psychology child development education extremely diverse
philosophical framework includes interpretations cognitive role mediation tools well re-interpretation well-known concepts psychology such internalization knowledge
vygotsky introduced notion zone proximal development metaphor capable describing potential human cognitive development
work covered topics such origin psychology art development higher mental functions philosophy science methodology psychological research relation learning human development concept formation interrelation language thought development play psychological phenomenon learning disabilities abnormal human development aka defectology
scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout career generally vygotsky's legacy divided two fairly distinct periods[citation needed] transitional phase two during vygotsky experienced crisis theory personal life
these mechanistic instrumental period 1920 s integrative holistic period 1930 s transitional years roughly 1929-1931
each these periods characterized distinct themes theoretical innovations
instrumental period 1920 s section requires expansion
june 2013 cultural mediation internalization vygotsky studied child development significant roles cultural mediation interpersonal communication
observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions also represented shared knowledge culture
process known internalization
internalization understood respect knowing how
example riding bicycle pouring cup milk tools society initially outside beyond child
mastery these skills occurs through activity child within society
further aspect internalization appropriation child takes tool makes own perhaps using way unique himself
internalizing use pencil allows child use very much own ends rather drawing exactly others society drawn previously
period crisis criticism self-criticism 1929–1932 section requires expansion
june 2013 1930 s vygotsky engaged massive reconstruction theory instrumental period 1920 s
around 1929-1930 realized numerous deficiencies imperfections earlier work vygotsky circle criticized number occasions 1929 1930 1931 1932
specifically vygotsky criticized earlier idea radical separation lower higher psychological functions around 1932 appears abandon
vygotsky's self-criticism complemented external criticism number issues including separation higher lower psychological functions impracticality inapplicability theory social practices such industry education during time rapid social change vulgar marxist interpretation human psychological processes
critics also pointed overemphasis role language other hand ignorance emotional factors human development
major figures soviet psychology such sergei rubinstein criticized vygotsky's notion mediation development works students
following criticism response generous offer highest officials soviet ukraine major group vygotsky's associates members vygotsky circle including luria mark lebedinsky leontiev moved moscow ukraine establish kharkov school psychology
second half 1930 s vygotsky yet again criticized involvement cross-disciplinary study child known paedology uncritical borrowings contemporary bourgeois science
considerable critique came alleged vygotsky's followers such leontiev members research group kharkov
much early criticism later discarded these vygotskian scholars themselves
holistic period 1932–1934 section requires expansion
june 2013 period major revision vygotsky's theory transition mechanist orientation 1920 s integrative holistic science 1930 s
during period vygotsky under particularly strong influence holistic theories german-american group proponents gestalt psychology most notably peripheral participants gestalt movement kurt goldstein kurt lewin
however vygotsky's work period remained largely fragmentary unfinished therefore unpublished
zone proximal development zone proximal development zpd vygotsky’s term range tasks child process learning complete
lower limit zpd level skill reached child working independently also referred child’s actual developmental level
upper limit level potential skill child able reach assistance capable instructor
vygotsky viewed zpd way better explain relation children’s learning cognitive development
prior zpd relation learning development boiled down following three major positions development precedes learning e
constructivism children first need meet particular maturation level before learning occur 2 learning development cannot separated instead occur simultaneously e
behaviorism essentially learning development 3 learning development separate interactive processes e
gestaltism process prepares other process vice versa
vygotsky rejected these three major theories because believed learning precedes development zpd
other words through assistance capable person child able learn skills aspects skill go beyond child’s actual developmental maturational level
therefore development follows child’s potential learn
sense zpd provides prospective view cognitive development opposed retrospective view characterizes development terms child’s independent capabilities
thought language perhaps vygotsky's most important contribution concerns inter-relationship language development thought
concept explored vygotsky's book thought language russian myshlenie rech alternative translation thinking speaking establishes explicit profound connection speech both silent inner speech oral language development mental concepts cognitive awareness
vygotsky described inner speech being qualitatively different normal external speech
although vygotsky believed inner speech developed external speech via gradual process internalization younger children really able think out loud claimed mature form inner speech unintelligible anyone except thinker resemble spoken language know particular being greatly compressed
hence thought itself develops socially
language starts tool external child used social interaction
child guides personal behavior using tool kind self-talk thinking out loud
initially self-talk very much tool social interaction tapers negligible levels child alone deaf children
gradually self-talk used tool self-directed self-regulating behavior
because speaking appropriated internalized self-talk no longer present around time child starts school
self-talk develops along rising declining curve goes through evolution involution
end becomes inner speech vygotsky 1987 pg 57
speaking thus developed along two lines line social communication line inner speech child mediates regulates her activity through their thoughts
thoughts turn mediated semiotics meaningful signs inner speech
say thinking cannot take place without language rather mediated thus develops much higher level sophistication
just birthday cake sign provides much deeper meaning physical properties allow inner speech sign provides much deeper meaning lower psychological functions otherwise allow
death 1934 posthumous fame vygotsky died tuberculosis june 1934 age 37 moscow soviet union
last vygotsky's private notebook entries gives proverbial yet very pessimistic self-assessment contribution psychological theory final thing done psychology will like moses die summit having glimpsed promised land without setting foot
farewell dear creations
rest silence
immediately after death vygotsky proclaimed leading psychologists soviet union although stellar reputation somewhat undermined decree central committee communist party 1936 denounced mass movement discipline related social practice so-called pedology
yet even despite criticisms even censorship works—most notably post-stalin era soviet union 1960 s-1980 s russian alleged self-proclaimed best students followers—vygotsky remained among most quoted scholars field become cult figure number contemporary intellectuals practitioners russia international psychological educational community alike

1962 translation posthumous book thinking speech came out under title thought language seem considerably change situation
after eclectic compilation partly rephrased partly translated works vygotsky collaborators however came out under vygotsky's name book titled mind society vygotsky boom started west originally north america later following north american example spread other regions world
version vygotskian science typically associated names chief proponents michael cole james wertsch their associates followers relatively well-known under names cultural-historical activity theory aka chat yet distant vygotsky's legacy activity theory
scaffolding concept introduced wood bruner ross 1976 somewhat related idea zpd although vygotsky never actually used term
criticisms north american vygotskian legacy critique north american interpretation vygotsky's ideas somewhat later global spread dissemination appeared 1980 s
early 1980 s criticism russian western vygotskian scholars continued throughout 1990 s
thus different authors emphasized biased fragmented interpretations vygotsky representatives termed neo-vygotskian fashions contemporary psychology selective traditions vygotskian scholarship
characteristically most fashionable vygotskian phraseology wide circulation western scholarly educational discourse—such so-called zone proximal development—in critical literature period referred most used least understood constructs appear contemporary educational literature construct used little fashionable alternative piagetian terminology concept iq describing individual differences attainment potential
other authors also suggest clearly distinguishing original vygotsky's notion zona blizhaishego razvitiia zbr later western superficial interpretations known under umbrella term zone proximal development zpd
criticism continued reached peak 2000 s
most often these critiques address numerous distortions vygotsky's ideas mere declarations faith versions vygotsky concepts inferences curiously attributed lev vygotsky multiple readings vygotsky which—for instance activity theory—are referred dead end” cultural-historical psychology moreover methodological thinking cultural psychology
publications question anyone actually reads vygotsky’s words whether too late understand vygotsky classroom suggest turning vygotsky head
inconsistencies contradictions times fundamental flaws vygotskian literature revealed ocean critical publications subject typically associated with—but certainly limited to—the north american legacy michael cole james wertsch their associates
these criticisms contributed significantly increasing awareness numerous challenges claiming vygotskian perspective
revisionist movement vygotsky studies revisionist movement vygotsky studies termed revisionist revolution order describe relatively recent trend emerged 1990 s
trend typically associated growing dissatisfaction quality scholarly integrity available english translations texts vygotsky members vygotsky circle made largely mistaken distorted even few instances falsified soviet editions raises serious concerns reliability vygotsky's texts available english
however unlike critical literature discusses western interpretations vygotsky's legacy target criticism primary object research studies revisionist strand vygotsky's texts proper manuscripts original lifetime publications vygotsky's posthumous soviet editions most often subsequently uncritically translated other languages
revisionist strand solidly grounded series studies vygotsky's archives uncovered previously unknown unpublished vygotsky's materials
thus studies revisionist strand show certain phrases terms expressions typically associated vygotskian legacy core notions concepts—such cultural-historical psychology cultural-historical theory cultural-historical school higher psychical/mental functions internalization zone proximal development etc
-- fact either occupy just few dozen pages within six-volume collection vygotsky’s works even never occur vygotsky's own writings
another series studies revealed questionable quality vygotsky's published texts fact never finished intended publication their author nevertheless posthumously published without giving proper editorial acknowledgement their unfinished transitory nature numerous editorial interventions distortions vygotsky's text
another series publications reveals another well-known vygotsky's text often presented foundational work back-translated russian english translation lost original passed original vygotsky's writing
