nevertheless author recognized most promising young poet time

most important events tasso's biography during following four years completion aminta 1573 gerusalemme liberata 1574
aminta pastoral drama very simple plot exquisite lyrical charm
appeared moment music under influence composers like palestrina monteverdi marenzio others becoming dominant art italy
honeyed melodies sensuous melancholy aminta exactly suited interpreted spirit age
influence opera cantata felt through two successive centuries
aminta first printed aldo manuzio venice january 1581
croatian translation aminta poet dominko zlatarić ljubmir pripovijest pastijerska printed year before original also venice
gerusalemme liberata gerusalemme liberata occupies larger space history european literature considerable work
yet commanding qualities epic poem those revealed tasso's individuality made immediately pass rank classics beloved people no less persons culture akin lyrical graces aminta
hero godfrey bouillon leader first crusade climax epic capture holy city
finished tasso's thirty-first year manuscripts lay before best part life over best work already accomplished
troubles immediately began gather round
instead having courage obey own instinct publish gerusalemme conceived yielded excessive scrupulosity formed feature paranoid character
poem sent manuscript large committee eminent literary men tasso expressing willingness hear their strictures adopt their suggestions unless convert them own views
result each these candid friends while expressing general high admiration epic took exception plot title moral tone episodes diction detail
wished regularly classical another wanted romance
hinted inquisition tolerate supernatural machinery another demanded excision most charming passages loves armida clorinda erminia
tasso defend himself against these ineptitudes pedantries accommodate practice theories rashly expressed
rinaldo also jerusalem delivered aimed ennobling italian epic style preserving strict unity plot heightening poetic diction
chose virgil model took first crusade subject infused fervor religion conception hero godfrey
natural bent romance
spite poet's ingenuity industry stately main theme evinced less spontaneity genius romantic episodes adorned done rinaldo
godfrey mixture pious aeneas tridentine catholicism real hero gerusalemme
fiery passionate rinaldo ruggiero melancholy impulsive tancredi chivalrous saracens whom clash love war divide reader's interest divert goffredo
action epic turns armida beautiful witch sent forth infernal senate sow discord christian camp
she converted true faith her adoration crusading knight quits scene phrase virgin mary her lips
brave clorinda dons armor like ariosto's marfisa fighting duel her devoted lover receiving baptism hands time her pathetic death erminia seeks refuge shepherds' hut
these lovely pagan women touching their sorrows romantic their adventures tender their emotions rivet readers' attention while battles religious ceremonies conclaves stratagems campaign easily skipped
truth tasso's great invention artist poetry sentiment
sentiment sentimentality gives value immortal gerusalemme
new thing 16 th century something concordant growing feeling woman ascendant art music
sentiment refined noble natural steeped melancholy exquisitely graceful pathetically touching breathes throughout episodes gerusalemme finds metrical expression languishing cadence mellifluous verse sustains ideal life those seductive heroines whose names familiar household words europe 17 th 18 th centuries
tasso's self-chosen critics men admit public since accepted incontrovertible
vaguely felt great beautiful romantic poem imbedded dull very correct epic
their uneasiness suggested every course right publish gerusalemme without further dispute
tasso already overworked precocious studies exciting court-life exhausting literary industry now grew almost mad worry
health began fail
complained headache suffered malarious fevers wished leave ferrara
gerusalemme laid manuscript upon shelf
opened negotiations court florence exchange service
irritated duke ferrara
alfonso hated nothing see courtiers especially famous ones leave rival duchy
moreover alfonso married french calvinist princess thus justly worried antagonizing orthodox powers italy concentrated florence rome
difficult relationships court ferrara alfonso ii d'este portrait girolamo da carpi alfonso thought moreover tasso allowed go medici get coveted dedication already famous epic
therefore bore poet's humors contrived latter should no excuse quitting ferrara
meanwhile through years 1575 1576 1577 tasso's health grew worse
jealousy inspired courtiers malign insult
irritable suspicious temper vain sensitive slights rendered too easy prey their malevolence
course 1570 s tasso developed persecution mania led legends restless half-mad misunderstood author
became consumed thoughts servants betrayed confidence fancied denounced inquisition expected daily poisoned
literary political events surrounding contributed upsets mental state troubles stress social troubles escalating
autumn 1576 tasso quarrelled ferrarese gentleman maddalo talked too freely same-sex love affair same year letter homosexual friend luca scalabrino dealing own love 21-year-old young man orazio ariosto[a] summer 1577 drew knife upon servant presence lucrezia d'este duchess urbino
excess arrested duke released took change air country seat belriguardo
happened there known
biographers surmised compromising liaison leonora d'este came light tasso agreed feign madness order cover her honor there no proof
certain belriguardo returned franciscan convent ferrara express purpose attending health
there dread being murdered duke took firm hold mind
escaped end july disguised himself peasant went foot sister sorrento
conclusions tasso after beginning 1575 became victim mental malady without amounting actual insanity rendered fantastical insupportable cause anxiety patrons
there no evidence whatsoever later romantic myth state things due overwhelming passion leonora
duke contrary image tyrant showed considerable forbearance
though rigid unsympathetic man egotistical any princeling era tasso never cruel unintelligent perhaps far being monster ferocity later portrayed
subsequent history connection poet corroborates view
while sister sorrento tasso yearned ferrara
court-made man breathe freely outside charmed circle
humbly requesting taken back
alfonso consented provided tasso agree undergo medical course treatment melancholy
returned alacrity under those conditions well received ducal family
might gone well old maladies revived
scene followed scene irritability moodiness suspicion wounded vanity violent outbursts
madhouse st
anna summer 1578 ran away again traveled through mantua padua venice urbino lombardy
september reached gates turin foot courteously entertained emmanuel philibert duke savoy
wherever went wandering like world's rejected guest met honor due illustrious name
great folk opened their houses gladly partly compassion partly admiration genius
soon wearied their society wore their kindness thin querulous peevishness
seemed moreover life intolerable outside ferrara
accordingly once opened negotiations duke february 1579 again set foot castle
alfonso contract third marriage time princess house mantua
no children unless got heir there probability state fall fact eventually holy see
nuptial festivals eve tasso arrived therefore occasion great rejoicing elderly bridegroom
forlorn hope wed third wife heart engaged expectations far sanguine

emerges clearly them labored under serious mental disease conscious
meanwhile occupied uneasy leisure copious compositions
mass prose dialogues philosophical ethical themes very considerable belong years imprisonment st
except occasional odes sonnets—some written request others inspired keen sense suffering therefore poignant—he neglected poetry

battista guarini tasso cell allow odes sonnets poems personal feeling occasional pieces compliment collected emended without lifting voice matter
few years later 1585 two florentine pedants crusca academy declared war against gerusalemme
loaded insults seem those read their pamphlets now mere parodies criticism
yet tasso felt bound reply moderation urbanity prove full possession reasoning faculties gentleman noble manners also
man like hamlet distraught through ill-accommodation circumstances age brain-sick undoubtedly duke ferrara's justification treatment endured
