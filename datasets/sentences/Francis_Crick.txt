research double helix william astbury oswald avery lawrence bragg francis crick erwin chargaff jerry donohue rosalind franklin raymond gosling frederick griffith phoebus levene friedrich miescher fred neufeld sir john randall alex stokes james watson maurice wilkins herbert wilson vte crick interested two fundamental unsolved problems biology how molecules make transition non-living living how brain makes conscious mind
realized background made qualified research first topic field biophysics
time crick’s transition physics biology influenced both linus pauling erwin schrödinger
clear theory covalent bonds biological molecules provide structural stability needed hold genetic information cells
remained exercise experimental biology discover exactly molecule genetic molecule
crick’s view charles darwin’s theory evolution natural selection gregor mendel’s genetics knowledge molecular basis genetics combined revealed secret life
crick very optimistic view life very soon created test tube
however people such fellow researcher colleague esther lederberg thought crick unduly optimistic clear macromolecule such protein likely genetic molecule
however well known proteins structural functional macromolecules carry out enzymatic reactions cells
1940 s evidence found pointing another macromolecule dna other major component chromosomes candidate genetic molecule
1944 avery-mac leod-mc carty experiment oswald avery collaborators showed heritable phenotypic difference caused bacteria providing them particular dna molecule
however other evidence interpreted suggesting dna structurally uninteresting possibly just molecular scaffold apparently interesting protein molecules
crick right place right frame mind right time 1949 join max perutz’s project university cambridge began work x-ray crystallography proteins
x-ray crystallography theoretically offered opportunity reveal molecular structure large molecules like proteins dna there serious technical problems then preventing x-ray crystallography being applicable such large molecules
1949–1950 crick taught himself mathematical theory x-ray crystallography
during period crick's study x-ray diffraction researchers cambridge lab attempting determine most stable helical conformation amino acid chains proteins alpha helix
linus pauling first identify 3
6 amino acids per helix turn ratio alpha helix
crick witness kinds errors co-workers made their failed attempts make correct molecular model α helix these turned out important lessons applied future helical structure dna
example learned importance structural rigidity double bonds confer molecular structures relevant both peptide bonds proteins structure nucleotides dna
1951–1953 dna structure 1951 1952 together william cochran vladimir vand crick assisted development mathematical theory x-ray diffraction helical molecule
theoretical result matched well x-ray data proteins contain sequences amino acids alpha helix conformation
helical diffraction theory turned out also useful understanding structure dna
late 1951 crick started working james watson cavendish laboratory university cambridge england
using photo 51 x-ray diffraction results rosalind franklin her graduate student raymond gosling king's college london given them gosling franklin's colleague maurice wilkins watson crick together developed model helical structure dna published 1953
subsequent work jointly awarded nobel prize physiology medicine 1962 maurice wilkins
james watson came cambridge crick 35-year-old graduate student due work during wwii watson 23 already ph
shared interest fundamental problem learning how genetic information might stored molecular form
watson crick talked endlessly dna idea might possible guess good molecular model structure
key piece experimentally-derived information came x-ray diffraction images obtained maurice wilkins rosalind franklin their research student raymond gosling
november 1951 wilkins came cambridge shared data watson crick
alexander stokes another expert helical diffraction theory wilkins both king's college reached conclusion x-ray diffraction data dna indicated molecule helical structure—but franklin vehemently disputed conclusion
stimulated their discussions wilkins watson learned attending talk given franklin her work dna crick watson produced showed off erroneous first model dna
their hurry produce model dna structure driven part knowledge competing against linus pauling
given pauling's recent success discovering alpha helix feared pauling might also first determine structure dna
many speculated might happened pauling able travel britain planned may 1952
political activities caused travel restricted u
government visit uk until later point met none dna researchers england
any rate preoccupied proteins time dna
watson crick officially working dna
crick writing ph
thesis watson also other work such trying obtain crystals myoglobin x-ray diffraction experiments
1952 watson performed x-ray diffraction tobacco mosaic virus found results indicating helical structure
having failed once watson crick now somewhat reluctant try again while forbidden make further efforts find molecular model dna
diagram emphasizes phosphate backbone dna
watson crick first made helical models phosphates center helices
great importance model building effort watson crick rosalind franklin's understanding basic chemistry indicated hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones nucleotide chains dna should positioned interact water molecules outside molecule while hydrophobic bases should packed core
franklin shared chemical knowledge watson crick she pointed out them their first model 1951 phosphates inside obviously wrong
crick described saw failure maurice wilkins rosalind franklin cooperate work towards finding molecular model dna major reason why watson eventually made second attempt
asked received permission both william lawrence bragg wilkins
order construct their model dna watson crick made use information unpublished x-ray diffraction images franklin's shown meetings freely shared wilkins including preliminary accounts franklin's results/photographs x-ray images included written progress report king's college laboratory sir john randall late 1952
matter debate whether watson crick should access franklin's results without her knowledge permission before she chance formally publish results her detailed analysis her x-ray diffraction data included progress report
however watson crick found fault her steadfast assertion according her data helical structure possible shape dna—so dilemma
effort clarify issue max ferdinand perutz later published progress report suggested nothing report franklin herself her talk attended watson late 1951
further perutz explained report medical research council mrc committee created order establish contact different groups people working council
randall's perutz's laboratories both funded mrc
also clear how important franklin's unpublished results progress report actually model-building done watson crick
after first crude x-ray diffraction images dna collected 1930 s william astbury talked stacks nucleotides spaced 3
4 angström 0
34 nanometre intervals dna
citation astbury's earlier x-ray diffraction work eight references franklin's first paper dna
analysis astbury's published dna results better x-ray diffraction images collected wilkins franklin revealed helical nature dna
possible predict number bases stacked within single turn dna helix 10 per turn full turn helix 27 angströms [2
7 nm] compact form 34 angströms [3
4 nm] wetter form
wilkins shared information form dna crick watson
crick see franklin's form x-ray images photo 51 until after dna double helix model published
few references cited watson crick published their model dna published article included sven furberg's dna model bases inside
thus watson crick model first bases model proposed
furberg's results also provided correct orientation dna sugars respect bases
during their model building crick watson learned antiparallel orientation two nucleotide chain backbones worked best orient base pairs centre double helix
crick's access franklin's progress report late 1952 made crick confident dna double helix antiparallel chains there other chains reasoning sources information also led these conclusions
result leaving king's college birkbeck college franklin asked john randall give up her work dna
became clear wilkins supervisors watson crick franklin going new job linus pauling working structure dna willing share franklin's data watson crick hope find good model dna before pauling able
franklin's x-ray diffraction data dna her systematic analysis dna's structural features useful watson crick guiding them towards correct molecular model
key problem watson crick resolved data king's college guess how nucleotide bases pack core dna double helix
diagrammatic representation key structural features dna
similar structures guaninecytosine adeninethymine base pairs illustrated
base pairs held together hydrogen bonds
phosphate backbones anti-parallel
another key finding correct structure dna so-called chargaff ratios experimentally determined ratios nucleotide subunits dna amount guanine equal cytosine amount adenine equal thymine
visit erwin chargaff england 1952 reinforced salience important fact watson crick
significance these ratios structure dna recognized until watson persisting building structural models realized cg pairs structurally similar
particular length each base pair same
chargaff also pointed out watson aqueous saline environment cell predominant tautomers pyrimidine c t bases amine keto configurations cytosine thymine rather imino enol forms crick watson assumed
consulted jerry donohue confirmed most likely structures nucleotide bases
base pairs held together hydrogen bonds same non-covalent interaction stabilize protein α-helix
correct structures essential positioning hydrogen bonds
these insights led watson deduce true biological relationships cg pairs
after discovery hydrogen bonded cg pairs watson crick soon their anti-parallel double helical model dna hydrogen bonds core helix providing way unzip two complementary strands easy replication last key requirement likely model genetic molecule
important crick's contributions discovery double helical dna model stated without chance collaborate watson found structure himself
crick tentatively attempt perform experiments nucleotide base pairing theoretical biologist experimental biologist
there another near-discovery base pairing rules early 1952
crick started think interactions bases
asked john griffith try calculate attractive interactions dna bases chemical principles quantum mechanics
griffith's best guess gc attractive pairs
time crick aware chargaff's rules made little griffith's calculations although start thinking complementary replication
identification correct base-pairing rules a-t g-c achieved watson playing cardboard cut-out models nucleotide bases much manner linus pauling discovered protein alpha helix few years earlier
watson crick discovery dna double helix structure made possible their willingness combine theory modeling experimental results albeit mostly done others achieve their goal
dna double helix structure proposed watson crick based upon watson-crick bonds four bases most frequently found dna c t g rna c u g
however later research showed triple-stranded quadruple-stranded other complex dna molecular structures required hoogsteen base pairing
entire field synthetic biology began work researchers such erik t
kool bases other c t g used synthetic dna
addition synthetic dna there also attempts construct synthetic codons synthetic endonucleases synthetic proteins synthetic zinc fingers
using synthetic dna instead there being 43 codons there n new bases there many n3 codons
research currently being done see codons expanded 3 bases
these new codons code new amino acids
these synthetic molecules used medicine creation new materials

[citation needed] after discovery double helix model dna crick's interests quickly turned biological implications structure
1953 watson crick published another article nature stated therefore seems likely precise sequence bases code carries genetical information
collagen triple helix
[citation needed] 1956 crick watson speculated structure small viruses
suggested spherical viruses such tomato bushy stunt virus icosahedral symmetry made 60 identical subunits
after short time new york crick returned cambridge worked until 1976 time moved california
crick engaged several x-ray diffraction collaborations such alexander rich structure collagen
however crick quickly drifting away continued work related expertise interpretation x-ray diffraction patterns proteins
george gamow established group scientists interested role rna intermediary dna genetic storage molecule nucleus cells synthesis proteins cytoplasm rna tie club
clear crick there code short sequence nucleotides specify particular amino acid newly synthesized protein
1956 crick informal paper genetic coding problem small group scientists gamow's rna group
article crick reviewed evidence supporting idea there common set 20 amino acids used synthesize proteins
crick proposed there corresponding set small adaptor molecules hydrogen bond short sequences nucleic acid also link amino acids
also explored many theoretical possibilities short nucleic acid sequences might code 20 amino acids
molecular model t rna molecule
[citation needed] crick predicted such adaptor molecules might exist links codons amino acids
during mid-to-late 1950 s crick very much intellectually engaged sorting out mystery how proteins synthesized
1958 crick's thinking matured list orderly way key features protein synthesis process genetic information stored sequence dna molecules messenger rna molecule carry instructions making protein cytoplasm adaptor molecules might contain nucleotides match short sequences nucleotides rna messenger molecules specific amino acids ribonucleic-protein complexes catalyse assembly amino acids proteins according messenger rna adaptor molecules eventually shown t rnas catalytic ribonucleic-protein complexes became known ribosomes
important step later realization 1960 messenger rna same ribosomal rna
none however answered fundamental theoretical question exact nature genetic code
1958 article crick speculated others triplet nucleotides code amino acid
such code might degenerate 4×4×4=64 possible triplets four nucleotide subunits while there 20 amino acids
amino acids might multiple triplet codes
crick also explored other codes various reasons triplets used magically producing just 20 needed combinations
experimental results needed theory alone decide nature code
crick also used term central dogma summarize idea implies genetic information flow macromolecules essentially one-way dna → rna → protein critics thought using word dogma crick implying rule questioned really meant compelling idea without much solid evidence support
thinking biological processes linking dna genes proteins crick made explicit distinction materials involved energy required information flow
crick focused third component information became organizing principle became known molecular biology
crick time become highly influential theoretical molecular biologist
proof genetic code degenerate triplet code finally came genetics experiments performed crick
details code came mostly work marshall nirenberg others synthesized synthetic rna molecules used them templates vitro protein synthesis
nirenberg first announced results small audience moscow 1961 conference
crick's reaction invite nirenberg deliver talk larger audience
controversy article nominated checked neutrality
discussion nomination found talk page
november 2015 enduring controversy generated watson crick's use dna x-ray diffraction data collected rosalind franklin her student raymond gosling
controversy arose fact franklin's unpublished data used without her knowledge consent watson crick their construction double helix model dna
four dna researchers rosalind franklin degree chemistry wilkins crick backgrounds physics watson molecular biology
prior publication double helix structure watson crick little direct interaction franklin herself
however aware her work aware she herself realized
watson present lecture given november 1951 franklin presented two forms molecule type type discussed position phosphate units external part molecule
she also specified amount water found molecule accordance other parts data considerable importance terms stability molecule
franklin first discover formulate these facts fact constituted basis later attempts build model molecule
before both linus pauling watson crick generated erroneous models chains inside bases pointing outwards
her identification space group dna crystals revealed crick two dna strands antiparallel
january 1953 james watson shown x-ray photograph b-dna called photograph 51 maurice wilkins
maurice wilkins given photograph 51 rosalind franklin's ph
student raymond gosling
wilkins gosling worked together medical research council's mrc biophysics unit before director john randall appointed franklin take over both dna diffraction work guidance gosling's thesis
appears randall communicate effectively them franklin's appointment contributing confusion friction wilkins franklin
middle february 1953 crick's thesis advisor max perutz gave crick copy report written medical research council biophysics committee visit king's december 1952 containing data king's group including rosalind franklin's crystallographic calculations
franklin unaware photograph 51 other information shared crick watson
she series three draft manuscripts two included double helical dna backbone
her two form manuscripts reached acta crystallographica copenhagen 6 march 1953 day before crick watson completed their model
x-ray diffraction images collected gosling franklin provided best evidence helical nature dna
franklin's experimental work thus proved crucial watson crick's discovery
her experimental results provided estimates water content dna crystals these results most consistent three sugar-phosphate backbones being outside molecule
franklin's x-ray photograph showed backbones outside
although she first insisted vehemently her data force conclude dna helical structure drafts she submitted 1953 she argues double helical dna backbone
her identification space group dna crystals revealed crick dna strands antiparallel helped watson crick decide look dna models two antiparallel polynucleotide strands
summary watson crick three sources franklin's unpublished data her 1951 seminar attended watson 2 discussions wilkins worked same laboratory franklin 3 research progress report intended promote coordination medical research council-supported laboratories
watson crick wilkins franklin worked mrc laboratories
crick watson felt benefited collaborating wilkins
offered co-authorship article first described double helix structure dna
wilkins turned down offer fact may led terse character acknowledgment experimental work done king's college eventual published paper
rather make any dna researchers king's college co-authors watson crick double helix article solution arrived publish two additional papers king's college along helix paper
brenda maddox suggests because importance her experimental results watson crick's model building theoretical analysis franklin should her name original watson crick paper nature
franklin gosling submitted their own joint 'second' paper nature same time wilkins stokes wilson submitted theirs
'third' paper dna
watson's portrayal franklin double helix written after franklin's death libel laws apply anymore negative gave appearance she wilkins' assistant unable interpret her own dna data
x-ray diffraction images collected franklin provided best evidence helical nature dna
while franklin's experimental work proved important crick watson's development correct model she herself realize time
she left king's college director sir john randall insisted dna work belonged exclusively king's ordered franklin even think

views religion crick referred himself humanist defined belief human problems must faced terms human moral intellectual resources without invoking supernatural authority
publicly called humanism replace religion guiding force humanity writing human dilemma hardly new
find ourselves through no wish our own slowly revolving planet obscure corner vast universe
our questioning intelligence will let us live cow-like content our lot
deep need know why here
world made of? important made of? past religion answered these questions often considerable detail
now know almost these answers highly likely nonsense having sprung man's ignorance enormous capacity self-deception
simple fables religions world come seem like tales children
even understood symbolically often perverse rather unpleasant
humanists then live mysterious exciting intellectually expanding world once glimpsed makes old worlds religions seem fake-cosy stale
crick especially critical christianity respect christian beliefs
think ridiculous
get rid them easily get down serious problem trying find out world
crick once joked christianity may ok consenting adults private should taught young children
book molecules men crick expressed views relationship science religion
after suggesting become possible computer programmed soul wondered point during biological evolution first organism soul? moment does baby get soul? crick stated view idea non-material soul enter body then persist after death just imagined idea
crick mind product physical brain activity brain evolved natural means over millions years
felt important evolution natural selection taught schools regrettable english schools compulsory religious instruction
also considered new scientific world view rapidly being established predicted once detailed workings brain eventually revealed erroneous christian concepts nature humans world no longer tenable traditional conceptions soul replaced new understanding physical basis mind
sceptical organized religion referring himself skeptic agnostic strong inclination towards atheism
1960 crick accepted honorary fellowship churchill college cambridge factor being new college chapel
time later large donation made establish chapel college council decided accept
crick resigned fellowship protest
october 1969 crick participated celebration 100 th year journal nature attempted make predictions next 30 years hold molecular biology
speculations later published nature
near end article crick briefly mentioned search life other planets held little hope extraterrestrial life found year 2000
also discussed described possible new direction research called biochemical theology
crick many people pray finds hard believe get satisfaction
crick suggested might possible find chemical changes brain molecular correlates act prayer
speculated there might detectable change level neurotransmitter neurohormone people pray
might imagining substances such dopamine released brain under certain conditions produce rewarding sensations
crick's suggestion there might someday new science biochemical theology seems realized under alternative name there now new field neurotheology
crick's view relationship science religion continued play role work made transition molecular biology research theoretical neuroscience
crick asked 1998 bible manifestly wrong why should any rest accepted automatically?
important find our true place universe removing these unfortunate vestiges earlier beliefs? 2003 nobel laureates signed humanist manifesto
directed panspermia during 1960 s crick became concerned origins genetic code
1966 crick took place leslie orgel meeting orgel talk origin life
crick speculated possible stages initially simple code few amino acid types might evolved complex code used existing organisms
time everyone thought proteins kind enzymes ribozymes yet found
many molecular biologists puzzled problem origin protein replicating system complex exists organisms currently inhabiting earth
early 1970 s crick orgel further speculated possibility production living systems molecules may very rare event universe once developed spread intelligent life forms using space travel technology process called directed panspermia
retrospective article crick orgel noted overly pessimistic chances abiogenesis earth assumed kind self-replicating protein system molecular origin life
1976 crick addressed origin protein synthesis paper sydney brenner aaron klug george pieczenik
paper based pieczenik's work speculate code constraints nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis without need ribosome
however requires five base binding m rna t rna flip anti-codon creating triplet coding even though five-base physical interaction
thomas h

crick's period cambridge pinnacle long scientific career left cambridge 1977 after 30 years having offered having refused mastership gonville & caius
james watson claimed cambridge conference marking 50 th anniversary discovery structure dna 2003 now perhaps it's pretty well kept secret most uninspiring acts university cambridge over past century turn down francis crick applied professor genetics 1958
now there may series arguments led them reject francis

lord adrian first offered professorship compromise candidate guido pontecorvo refused offered then crick also refused
1976 crick took sabbatical year salk institute biological studies jolla california
crick nonresident fellow institute since 1960
crick felt home southern california
after sabbatical crick left cambridge order continue working salk institute
also professor university california san diego
taught himself neuroanatomy studied many other areas neuroscience research
took several years disengage molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued made including discovery alternative splicing discovery restriction enzymes helped make possible genetic engineering
eventually 1980 s crick able devote full attention other interest consciousness
autobiographical book mad pursuit personal view scientific discovery includes description why left molecular biology switched neuroscience
upon taking up work theoretical neuroscience crick struck several things there many isolated subdisciplines within neuroscience little contact them many people interested behaviour treated brain black box consciousness viewed taboo subject many neurobiologists crick hoped might aid progress neuroscience promoting constructive interactions specialists many different subdisciplines concerned consciousness
even collaborated neurophilosophers such patricia churchland
1983 result their studies computer models neural networks crick mitchison proposed function rem sleep remove certain modes interactions networks cells mammalian cerebral cortex called hypothetical process 'reverse learning' 'unlearning'
final phase career crick established collaboration christof koch lead publication series articles consciousness during period spanning 1990 2005
crick made strategic decision focus theoretical investigation consciousness how brain generates visual awareness within few hundred milliseconds viewing scene
crick koch proposed consciousness seems mysterious because involves very short-term memory processes yet poorly understood
crick also published book describing how neurobiology reached mature enough stage consciousness subject unified effort study molecular cellular behavioural levels
crick's book astonishing hypothesis made argument neuroscience now tools required begin scientific study how brains produce conscious experiences
crick skeptical value computational models mental function based details brain structure function
reactions crick often described very talkative watson double helix implying lack modesty
personality combined scientific accomplishments produced many opportunities crick stimulate reactions others both inside outside scientific world centre intellectual professional life
crick spoke rapidly rather loudly infectious reverberating laugh lively sense humour
colleague salk institute described brainstorming intellectual powerhouse mischievous smile
francis never mean-spirited just incisive
detected microscopic flaws logic
room full smart scientists francis continually reearned position heavyweight champ
eugenics crick occasionally expressed views eugenics usually private letters
example crick advocated form positive eugenics wealthy parents encouraged children
once remarked long run unavoidable society will begin worry character next generation
subject moment tackle easily because people many religious beliefs until uniform view ourselves think risky try anything way eugenics
astonished next 100 200 years society come round view try improve next generation extent way another
