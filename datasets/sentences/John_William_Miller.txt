pedagogy williams miller taught courses across whole philosophical curriculum—i
epistemology metaphysics aesthetics semiotics political philosophy

there also no separating miller’s historical idealism pedagogical philosophy
known say cannot understand man unless take word

reflects upon himself
short making both these commitments—i
expression reflection—honest conversation no possible philosophy
speech classroom serves highlight philosophical bases conversation
influence writing teacher scholar miller best known initially

miller consciously sought middle route through oppositions realism idealism well pragmatism idealism
synthesis revision those contesting positions
miller philosophy means removing strife rather recognition thoughtful organization conflict
philosophize miller thoughtful control problem
important way describing thinking then say miller's philosophical synthesis does effectively resolve conflicts predecessors shows philosophical import their disputes way their contests outline must ingredient any worthwhile philosophy
conception defines philosophy activity criticism kantian sense term—i
aware conditions one's endeavors
stated above miller’s philosophy unites philosophical thinking historical thinking
doing fully integrated concepts action symbolism epistemology metaphysics
fruits approach seen ethical political philosophy
definition action dissertation subsequent book definition thing notes language 1980 miller tied together epistemology ontology via examination process definition
here possibility “static definition” attacked—i
definition no connection action defined thing fundamentally ahistorical
unless definition considered manner miller argued cannot make sense our own participation process establishment meaning 2 evolution constant refinement our understanding things world
there dynamic relationship universal particular terms definition predicates thing defined
process definition founded human action meaning understood meaning human actor
bottom definition miller contended unending search local control—i
understanding oneself one’s world adequate support plan action
definition thus ties pragmatism
miller careful underscore appropriation pragmatism crude pragmatism simple means–ends thinking
rather miller saw fundamental practicality universal ideas fundamental concepts provide general order our world e
mathematics language their face useful any immediate sense
definition links together individual actors universal concepts existential dialectic meaning established revised
midworld midworld miller’s central ideas also most difficult understand
first needs stated midworld symbols miller called ‘’functioning objects’’ part answer problem universals
these universals part process definition? how arise? how relate particulars? miller’s response these age-old questions say universals embodied applied made evident action
just idea space established measuring devices like rulers
instruments such clocks determine idea time
idea justice founded judicial courts
rulers clocks courts—these symbolic objects practices
also functioning objects sense ruler different another piece wood terms does symbolic objects exist use no other way
miller made clear midworld symbols functioning objects midworld world proper rather totality functioning objects understanding object enough flexibility include regularized practices natural bodies such human organism
open-ended collection symbols also truly anything
midworld halfway subjectivity objectivity ideal real natural artificial
accurate say functioning object thing allows disclose subjective objective these two worlds experience fact their condition appearance
symbols midworld vehicles define ourselves define our world engage ongoing process those definitions revised light our discoveries world our new demands local control history definition historical process symbols midworld historical careers
need generate maintain revise meanings way understanding history such terms see unity epistemology ontology metaphysics provides deep context grasp miller writes regarding definition action symbol
miller embraced history works philosophy history drew close connection historical thinking philosophical thinking
contrast ancient tradition beginning least plato joins philosophy timeless
however miller noted philosophy ahistoric then philosophy produce observations
philosophy cannot related relevant action
course proponents contemplative life something recommended ahistoricism philosophy
miller questioned fundamental premises ahistoric philosophy arguing every observation thought action thus engagement history also cast doubt relevance philosophy does derive speak our pressing concerns personal order meaning right action
because miller’s philosophy fundamentally philosophy criticism grasp conditions our endeavors thus self-conscious responsible lives then our philosophy must historical go midworld historical career those very conditions
philosophy history must come together also considered appropriate light same
ethics politics critical philosophy becomes political philosophy virtue our involvement community
historical philosophical thought individual sort responsibility miller important sense responsibility individual herself
however concept individual begs pair society political institutions critical ethics must become critical politics
fashion miller’s historical idealism understood metaphysics democracy term borrowed walt whitman’s democratic vistas
ideal community provides people chance act chance effective become historical actors maintain revise conditions their endeavors
see task criticism order need support something unlike karl popper’s idea open society
here miller revisited traditional connection liberal democratic politics scientific community free respectful speech licensed formal modes criticism supported orderly change development key goal
order affect both politics science miller maintained noted above historical symbolic conception rationality endorsed
ultimately miller there convergence historical study political action
scholarship citizenship two sides same coin two facets active responsible life—i
understanding then engaging conditions one’s endeavors
