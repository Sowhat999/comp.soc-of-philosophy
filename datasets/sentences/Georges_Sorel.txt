became chief engineer department public works stationed briefly corsica longer period perpignan
1891 awarded légion d'honneur
retired 1892 moved boulogne-sur-seine near paris stayed until death
beginning second half 1880 s published articles various fields hydrology architecture physics political history philosophy displaying influence aristotle well hippolyte taine ernest renan
1893 publicly affirmed position marxist socialist
social political philosophy owed much reading proudhon karl marx giambattista vico henri bergson whose lectures collège de france attended later william james
sorel's engagement political world accompanied correspondence benedetto croce later vilfredo pareto
sorel worked first french marxist journals l’ère nouvelle le devenir social then participated turn century revisionist debate crisis within marxism
took side eduard bernstein against karl kautsky
sorel supported acquittal during dreyfus affair although like friend charles péguy later felt betrayed saw opportunism dreyfusards
through contributions enrico leone's il divenire sociale hubert lagardelle's mouvement socialiste contributed around 1905 theoretical elaboration revolutionary syndicalism
1906 most famous text reflections violence appeared last journal
published book form 1908 followed same year illusions du progrès
disappointed cgt sorel associated himself period 1909-1910 charles maurras’ action française while sharing neither nationalism nor political program
collaboration inspired founders cercle proudhon brought together revolutionary syndicalists monarchists
sorel himself jean variot founded journal 1911 called l'indépendance although disagreements part over nationalism soon ended project
ferociously opposed 1914 union sacrée sorel denounced war 1917 praised russian revolution calling lenin greatest theoretician socialism since marx
numerous small pieces italian newspapers defending bolsheviks
sorel extremely hostile gabriele d’annunzio poet attempted re-conquer fiume italy show sympathy rise fascism italy despite jean variot's later claims placed hopes benito mussolini
after war sorel published collection writings entitled matériaux d’une théorie du prolétariat
time death boulogne sur seine ambivalent attitude towards both fascism bolshevism
although writing touched many subjects sorel's work best characterized original interpretation marxism deeply anti-determinist politically anti-elitist anti-jacobin built direct action unions mobilizing role myth—especially general strike—and disruptive regenerative role violence
whether sorel better seen left-wing right-wing thinker disputed italian fascists praised forefather dictatorial government established ran contrary beliefs while also important touchstone italy's first communists saw sorel theorist proletariat
such widely divergent interpretations arise theory moral revival country must take place re-establish itself saving decadence yet whether revival must occur means middle upper classes proletariat point question
ideas most notably concept spontaneous general strike contributed significantly anarcho-syndicalism
political writings sorel began writing marginal marxist critical analyst marx's economics philosophy pious commentator
then embraced revisionism became several years metaphysician syndicalism jaures called flirted ardently royalist circles then reverted commitment proletariat
bolsheviks came power completed cycle illusions saluting vladimir lenin leader realized syndicalist myth
syndicalist militant trade union movement burst prominence france around 1900 inspired sorel write reflections violence
turmoil engendered strikes universally condemned even parliamentary socialists favored negotiation conciliation
justify militancy give syndicalism ideology sorel published series articles became biographers calls famous infamous book
indeed sorel's successful book dozen published
book published italian spanish german japanese english
two themes become part social science literature concept social myth virtue violence
sorel syndicalist's general strike marxist's catastrophic revolution christian's church militant legends french revolution remembrance june days myths move men quite independent their historical reality
sorel's disciples benito mussolini men move mountains necessary create illusion mountains move
social myths says sorel descriptions things expressions determination act
myths enclose strongest inclinations people party class general strike myth socialism wholly comprised
sorel general strike catastrophic conception socialism essence class struggle true marxist means effecting revolution
nowhere does sorel endorse indiscriminate brutal violence violence enlightened idea general strike unconditionally defended
violence marxist class war sorel conceived fine heroic service immemorial interest civilization
fact sorel makes no justification violence philosophical argument uses long excursions history current events suggest ethical codes relative their time place
consistent position describe declaration rights man colorless collection abstract confused formulas without any practical bearing
relation marxism sorel politically monarchist traditionalist before embracing orthodox marxism 1890 s
attempted fill believed gaps marxist theory resulting extremely heterodox idiosyncratic view marxism
instance sorel saw pessimism irrationalism core marxism rejected karl marx's own rationalism utopian tendency
sorel also saw marxism closer spirit early christianity french revolution
view marxism true scientific sense orthodox marxists believed marxism's truth lay promise morally redemptive role proletariat within terminally decadent society
sorel's voluntarist marxism rejected those marxists believed inevitable evolutionary change emphasizing instead importance will preferring direct action
these approaches included general strikes boycotts constant disruption capitalism goal being achieve worker control over means production
sorel's belief need deliberately conceived myth sway crowds concerted action put practice mass fascist movements 1920 s
epistemic status idea myth importance essentially working hypothesis fundamental peculiarity hypothesis judge closeness truth practical consequences stem
thus whether political myth importance must decided sorel's view basis capacity mobilize human beings political action possible way men ascend ethical life filled character sublime achieve deliverance
sorel believed energizing myth general strike serve enforce solidarity class consciousness revolutionary élan among working class
myth fascists appeal however race nation people represented state
anti-capitalism most famous work reflections violence 1908 sorel warned political trend conservatives parliamentary socialism become allies common struggle against capitalism
sorel's view conservatives parliamentary socialism common goals because both want nation centrally controlled organic unit parts working together whole
also parliamentarian socialism left wants economic nationalism huge tariff-barriers order protect their interior capitalists works well together cultural nationalism conservatives
sorel warned creation corporatism workers movements employers organizations forced merge each other thus ending class-struggle because felt parliamentary democracy moving direction beginning last century sorel workers stay away socialist parties use strikes violence their primary weapon against middle upper classes parliament
way workers fight harder their share values produced capitalism also help protect capitalism against semi-feudal corporative dystopia oligarchy socialists conservatives working towards
thoughts economics parliamentary democracy reflections violence sorel says parliamentary socialism middle-class bureaucrats newspaper-intellectuals does understand social science economics any other matter important good rule well traditional liberal capitalist elite ruled before mediocre middle-class became powerful force parliament
how these mediocre silly people become powerful? sorel asks
theory mediocre middle-class became powerful working-classes people without property given right vote end 18 th beginning 19 th century
thus working classes now created problem themselves creating political elite stupid less competent people monopoly power before them
proposed problem fixed collective withdrawal boycott parliamentary system workers
thus workers must return strikes violence their main political tool sorel says
gives workers sense unity return dignity weakens dangerous mediocre middle-class their struggle power their attack capitalism
[citation needed] anti-elitism sorel rejected political elitism because middle-classes tend co-opt organizational hierarchies turn them gentlemen's clubs people like talk theory write long newspaper articles
point made sorel reflections violence later developed further robert michels iron law oligarchy
sorel's antirealism isaiah berlin identifies three anti-scientific currents sorel's work sorel's attack science neither general nor piecemeal
rather attacks clear quotations below sorel explains how should view science relation called real thing
science reality dismissed science system idealised entities atoms electric charges mass energy like fictions compounded out observed uniformities
deliberately adapted mathematical treatment enable men identify furniture universe predict

[1 304] science recipe science maintained ‘mill’ you drop any problem facing you yields solutions [1 311] automatically true authentic
