views ibn mada rose fame first launch attack arabic grammar theory called reformation
although concerned attacking major schools arabic grammar focused grammar linguists basra most popular school around
attack eastern arabic grammar violent yet reasoned eloquent defending view grammar understood region complicated causistic obscure artificial ibn mada instead called building simple clear grammar based true facts language
among ideas considered revolutionary both during life renewed interest work during 1950 s abolition governance linguistic analogy
ibn mada felt scholarly work arabic language intentionally convoluted inaccessible both non-native speakers laymen arabs overall simplification language grammar enhance overall comprehension arabic
ibn mada held great respect language native speakers understood while emphasized simplification grammar advocate complete overhaul entire language
zahirite views muslim jurisprudence influenced views linguistics
explicitly denied ability human beings willfully choose say how say since speech like other things predetermined god
because arabic grammarians during ibn mada's time often linked spoken language grammatical causes earned both linguistic theological ire
view zahirite denial legal causality regard islamic law carried over denial linguistic causality regard arabic grammar
ibn mada's reaction toward arabic grammar grammarians wasn't without provocation
both earlier zahirite jurists such ibn hazm al-ballūṭī shafi'ites sparred hanafite jurists sought justify practices such istihsan anathema orthodox schools basis grammatical linguistic arguments
thus suspicion antagonism toward grammarians east hanafite rite predominated already started before ibn mada began whole-scale vehemence
legacy influence ibn mada's mastery arabic language subfields great time isolated general body scholarship terms sheer knowledge
refutation written toward end life demonstrated clarity thought independent judgment causing student ibn dihya al-kalby brand leader grammarians
critical views arabic grammar taught eastern muslim world found audience other linguistic religious scholars western half abu hayyan al gharnati being example
gharnati also criticized so-called eastern grammarians after treatise non-existence grammatic causality cited ibn mada inspiration
although ibn dihya abu hayyan ibn mada shared their zahirite andalusian backgrounds ibn mada's intellectual descendants shared these traits
thus while ibn mada opened discussion regarding competence grammarians suspicion surrounding them religious implications their work continued even after death
mid-20 th century rediscovery ibn mada's refutation egyptian linguist shawqi daif caused minor shockwaves
