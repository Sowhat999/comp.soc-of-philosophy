nicholas wroe guardian scruton latin quarter paris time watching students overturning cars erect barricades tearing up cobblestones throw police
suddenly realized other side
saw unruly mob self-indulgent middle-class hooligans
asked my friends wanted trying achieve got back ludicrous marxist gobbledegook
disgusted thought there must way back defence western civilization against these things
that's became conservative
knew wanted conserve things rather pull them down
activist campaigns tend conducted name people whole neither consult people nor show much interest noticing them—a point noticeable burke considering insolence french revolutionaries
such campaigns affairs elites seeking triumph over real imaginary adversaries make impact politics because share their hearts old socialist view things must changed top downwards people themselves trusted now later revolutionary vanguard completed task
“ ”scruton writing meaning conservatism 1980—which called somewhat hegelian defence tory values face their betrayal free marketeers—was book blighted academic career
gentle regrets 2005 found several edmund burke's arguments reflections revolution france 1790 persuasive
although burke writing revolution socialism scruton persuaded put utopian promises socialism accompanied abstract vision mind bears little relation way most people think
burke also convinced there no direction history no moral spiritual progress people think collectively toward common goal during crisis such war trying organize society way requires real imagined enemy hence scruton strident tone socialist literature
further argued following burke society held together authority rule law sense right obedience imagined rights citizens
obedience prime virtue political beings disposition makes possible govern them without societies crumble 'the dust powder individuality
real freedom scruton argued does stand conflict obedience other side
also persuaded burke's arguments social contract including most parties contract either dead yet born
forget wrote—to throw away customs institutions—is place present members society dictatorial dominance over those went before those came after them
armed rousseauist doctrines popular sovereignty marxist ideas power ideology revolutionary de-legitimize any existing institution find quite imperceivable distinction law aimed justice law aimed power
“ ”scruton writing 1989 scruton argued beliefs appear examples prejudice may useful important our most necessary beliefs may both unjustified unjustifiable our own perspective attempt justify them will merely lead their loss
prejudice favour modesty women chivalry men example may aid stability sexual relationships raising children though these offered reasons support prejudice
may therefore easy show prejudice irrational there will loss nonetheless discarded
arguments conservatism 2006 marked out areas philosophical thinking required conservatism intellectually persuasive
argued human beings creatures limited local affections
territorial loyalty root forms government law liberty reign supreme every expansion jurisdiction beyond frontiers nation state leads decline accountability
opposed elevating nation above people threaten rather facilitate citizenship peace
argued conservatism conservation two aspects single policy husbanding resources including social capital embodied laws customs institutions material capital contained environment
argued further law should used weapon advance special interests people impatient reform—for example areas euthanasia abortion—are reluctant accept may glaringly obvious others—that law exists precisely impede their ambitions
defined post-modernism claim there no grounds truth objectivity meaning therefore conflicts views nothing contests power argued while west required judge other cultures their own terms western culture adversely judged ethnocentric racist
very reasoning sets out destroy ideas objective truth absolute value imposes political correctness absolutely binding cultural relativism objectively true
scruton also critical contemporary feminist movement while reserving praise suffragists such mary wollstonecraft
religion totalitarianism scruton contends following immanuel kant human beings transcendental dimension sacred core exhibited their capacity self-reflection
argues era secularization without precedent history world

eliot edward hopper arnold schoenberg devoted much energy recuperating experience sacred—but private rather public form consciousness
scruton argues because these thinkers directed their art few never appealed many
defines totalitarianism absence any constraint central authority every aspect life concern government
advocates totalitarianism feed resentment scruton argues having seized power proceed abolish institutions—such law property religion—that create authorities
scruton writes resentful these institutions cause inequality therefore cause their humiliations failures
argues revolutions conducted below people above name people aspiring elite
scruton suggests importance newspeak totalitarian societies power language describe reality replaced language whose purpose avoid encounters realities
agrees alain besançon totalitarian society envisaged george orwell nineteen eighty-four understood theological terms society founded transcendental negation

eliot scruton believes true originality possible within tradition precisely modern conditions—conditions fragmentation heresy unbelief—that conservative project acquires sense
scruton considers religion plays basic function endarkening human minds
endarkenment scruton's way describing process socialization through certain behaviours choices closed off forbidden subject considers necessary order curb socially damaging impulses behaviours
sexual desire main article sexual desire book jonathan dollimore writes scruton's sexual desire 1986 based conservative sexual ethic hegelian proposition final end every rational being building self involves recognizing other end itself
scruton argues major feature perversion sexual release avoids abolishes other sees narcissistic solipsistic
essay sexual morality liberal consensus 1989 homosexuality perversion reason because body homosexual's lover belongs same category own
scruton's argument positive attitudes homosexuality society socially deleterious because homosexuals no children consequently no interest creating socially stable future
basic antisocial impulse scruton argued consequence homosexuality meant considered society justified continuing instil our children feelings revulsion towards homosexuality
guardian 2010 scruton stated changed views homosexuality no longer defend argued past
