objected any single prescriptive scientific method grounds any such method limit activities scientists hence restrict scientific progress
view science benefit most dose theoretical anarchism
also thought theoretical anarchism desirable because humanitarian other systems organization imposing rigid rules scientists
possible science know today search truth style traditional philosophy will create monster? possible objective approach frowns upon personal connections entities examined will harm people turn them miserable unfriendly self-righteous mechanisms without charm humour? possible asks kierkegaard my activity objective [or critico-rational] observer nature will weaken my strength human being? suspect answer many these questions affirmative believe reform sciences makes them anarchic subjective kierkegaard's sense urgently needed
against method
feyerabend's position originally seen radical philosophy science because implies philosophy neither succeed providing general description science nor devising method differentiating products science non-scientific entities like myths
feyerabend's position also implies philosophical guidelines should ignored scientists aim progress
support position methodological rules generally contribute scientific success feyerabend provides counterexamples claim good science operates according certain fixed method
took examples episodes science generally regarded indisputable instances progress e
copernican revolution showed common prescriptive rules science violated such circumstances
moreover claimed applying such rules these historical situations actually prevented scientific revolution
criteria evaluating scientific theories feyerabend attacks consistency criterion
points out insist new theories consistent old theories gives unreasonable advantage older theory
makes logical point being compatible defunct older theory does increase validity truth new theory over alternative covering same content
choose two theories equal explanatory power choose compatible older falsified theory make aesthetic rather rational choice
familiarity such theory might also make appealing scientists since will disregard many cherished prejudices
hence theory unfair advantage
feyerabend also critical falsificationism
argued no interesting theory ever consistent relevant facts
rule out using naïve falsificationist rule says scientific theories should rejected agree known facts
feyerabend uses several examples renormalization quantum mechanics provides example intentionally provocative style procedure consists crossing out results certain calculations replacing them description actually observed
thus admits implicitly theory trouble while formulating manner suggesting new principle discovered against method
feyerabend advocating scientists make use renormalization other ad hoc methods
instead arguing such methods essential progress science several reasons
these reasons progress science uneven
instance time galileo optical theory account phenomena observed means telescopes
astronomers used telescopic observation use ad hoc rules until justify their assumptions means optical theory
feyerabend critical any guideline aimed judge quality scientific theories comparing them known facts
thought previous theory might influence natural interpretations observed phenomena
scientists necessarily make implicit assumptions comparing scientific theories facts observe
such assumptions need changed order make new theory compatible observations
main example influence natural interpretations feyerabend provided tower argument
tower argument main objections against theory moving earth
aristotelians assumed fact stone dropped tower lands directly beneath shows earth stationary
thought earth moved while stone falling stone left behind
objects fall diagonally instead vertically
since does happen aristotelians thought evident earth move
uses ancient theories impulse relative motion copernican theory indeed appears falsified fact objects fall vertically earth
observation required new interpretation make compatible copernican theory
galileo able make such change nature impulse relative motion
before such theories articulated galileo make use ad hoc methods proceed counterinductively
ad hoc hypotheses actually positive function temporarily make new theory compatible facts until theory defended supported other theories
feyerabend commented galileo affair follows church time galileo much faithful reason galileo himself also took consideration ethical social consequences galileo's doctrine
verdict against galileo rational just revisionism legitimized solely motives political opportunism
together these remarks sanction introduction theories inconsistent well-established facts
furthermore pluralistic methodology involves making comparisons any theories forces defendants improve articulation each theory
way scientific pluralism improves critical power science
pope benedict xvi cited feyerabend effect
according feyerabend new theories came accepted because their accord scientific method because their supporters made use any trick rational rhetorical ribald order advance their cause
without fixed ideology introduction religious tendencies approach does inhibit progress using whichever definition sees fit anything goes 'anything goes' 'principle' hold
terrified exclamation rationalist takes closer look history
feyerabend 1975
feyerabend considered possibility incommensurability hesitant application concept
hardly ever possible give explicit definition [incommensurability]against method
because involves covert classifications major conceptual changes
also critical attempts capture incommensurability logical framework since thought incommensurability phenomenon outside domain logic
second appendix against method p
114 feyerabend states never
any two rival theories incommensurable
say certain rival theories so-called 'universal' theories 'non-instantial' theories interpreted certain way compared easily
incommensurability concern feyerabend greatly because believed even theories commensurable
compared outcome comparison should necessarily rule out either theory
rephrase theories incommensurable cannot rule each other out theories commensurable cannot rule each other out
assessments incommensurability therefore don't much effect feyerabend's system less passed over silence
against method feyerabend claimed imre lakatos's philosophy research programmes actually anarchism disguise because does issue orders scientists
feyerabend playfully dedicated against method imre lakatos friend fellow-anarchist
interpretation lakatos's philosophy mathematics science based creative transformations hegelian historiographic ideas many associated lakatos's teacher hungary georg lukács
feyerabend's debate lakatos scientific method recapitulates debate lukács feyerabend's would-be mentor brecht over aesthetics several decades earlier
while feyerabend described himself epistemological anarchist explicitly disavowed being political anarchist
anarchist-leaning critics science agreed distinction while others argued political anarchism tacitly embedded feyerabend's philosophy science
decline physicist-philosopher feyerabend critical lack knowledge philosophy shown generation physicists emerged after world war iithe withdrawal philosophy professional shell own disastrous consequences
younger generation physicists feynmans schwingers etc

mach einstein
role science society feyerabend described science being essentially anarchistic obsessed own mythology making claims truth well beyond actual capacity
especially indignant condescending attitudes many scientists towards alternative traditions
example thought negative opinions astrology effectivity rain dances justified scientific research dismissed predominantly negative attitudes scientists towards such phenomena elitist racist
opinion science become repressing ideology even though arguably started liberating movement
feyerabend thought pluralistic society should protected being influenced too much science just protected other ideologies
starting argument historical universal scientific method does exist feyerabend argues science does deserve privileged status western society
since scientific points view arise using universal method guarantees high quality conclusions thought there no justification valuing scientific claims over claims other ideologies like religions
feyerabend also argued scientific accomplishments such moon landings no compelling reason give science special status
opinion fair use scientific assumptions problems worth solving order judge merit other ideologies
additionally success scientists traditionally involved non-scientific elements such inspiration mythical religious sources
based these arguments feyerabend defended idea science should separated state same way religion state separated modern secular society against method 3 rd ed
envisioned free society traditions equal rights equal access centres power science free society
example parents should able determine ideological context their children's education instead having limited options because scientific standards
according feyerabend science should also subjected democratic control should subjects investigated scientists determined popular election scientific assumptions conclusions should also supervised committees lay people
[citation needed] thought citizens should use their own principles making decisions these matters
rejected view science especially rational grounds there no single common rational ingredient unites sciences excludes other modes thought against method 3 rd ed
