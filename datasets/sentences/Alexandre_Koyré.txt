much originality period rests ability ground studies modern science history religion metaphysics
koyré focused galileo plato isaac newton
most famous work closed world infinite universe series lectures given johns hopkins university 1959 rise early modern science change scientists' perception world during period nicholas cusa giordano bruno through newton
though book widely heralded summation koyré's perspective rather original new work
koyré suspicious scientists' claims prove natural fundamental truths through experiments
argued these experiments based complicated premises tended prove outlook behind these premises rather any real truth
repeatedly critiqued galileo's experiments claiming them taken place brought question results galileo claimed modern historians science hitherto accepted
according koyré experimental empirical nature galileo's newton's discoveries carried scientific revolution 16 th 17 th centuries shift perspective change theoretical outlook toward world
koyré strongly criticized called positivist notion science should discover given phenomena relations them certain laws help describe predict them

unlike husserl later studies koyré claimed modern science succeeded overcoming split inherent traditional aristotelian science earth space since these now both seen governed same laws

koyré's conclusions first challenged 1961 thomas

later stillman drake others worked through galileo's notes demonstrated galileo careful experimentalist whose observations play role development scientific system later claimed published work
