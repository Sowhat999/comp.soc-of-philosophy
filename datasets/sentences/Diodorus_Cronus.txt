diodorus taken disgrace much heart after return meal writing treatise problem died despair
however according strabo diodorus himself adopted surname cronus teacher apollonius cronus
diodorus thought died around 284 bce date birth unknown
once thought old enough influenced aristotle 384–322 bce there no strong evidence
diodorus particularly celebrated great dialectic skill called dialectician
effectively became surname descended even five daughters menexene argia theognis artemesia pantaclea likewise distinguished dialecticians
pupils included philo dialectician zeno citium — founder stoic school
although influenced megarian school clear how closely diodorus fellow dialecticians connected particular philosophical school
philosophy doctrines diodorus possess fragmentary information even titles works known
seems fully developed dialectic art megarian school
much occupied theory proof hypothetical propositions
same manner rejected logic divisibility fundamental notion also maintained physical doctrines space indivisible consequently motion impossible
further denied coming existence multiplicity both time space considered things fill up space whole composed infinite number indivisible particles
diodorus made use sorites paradox invented two others same kind viz
masked man horns however also ascribed eubulides
also rejected view words ambiguous any uncertainty understanding due speakers expressing themselves obscurely
master argument see also problem future contingents aristotle work interpretation wrestled problem future contingents
particular whether meaningfully regard future contingents true false now future open how? response diodorus maintained possible identical necessary e
contingent future certain defined past
alexander aphrodisias tells us diodorus believed alone possible either happening now will happen future time
speaking facts unrecorded past know well given fact either occurred occur yet without knowing two true — therefore affirm fact may occurred also future either assertion given fact will time occur positively true assertion will never occur positively true assertion may may occur time other represents our ignorance two true
will never any time occur impossible
diodorus went formulate argument became known master argument ruling argument ho kurieuôn logos
most succinct description provided epictetus argument called master argument appears proposed such principles these there fact common contradiction another these three propositions each two being contradiction third
propositions every past truth must necessary 2 impossibility does follow possibility 3 something possible neither nor will true
diodorus observing contradiction employed probative force first two demonstration proposition nothing possible true never will
epictetus' description master argument form presented diodorus makes difficult know precise nature argument
modern logicians obvious why these three premises inconsistent why first two should lead rejection third
modern interpretations therefore assume there must extra premises argument tacitly assumed diodorus contemporaries
possible reconstruction follows diodorus future event going happen then true past happen
since every past truth necessary proposition necessary past happen
since impossible cannot follow possible proposition 2 must impossible event occur
therefore something will true will never possible true thus proposition 3 shown false
epictetus goes point out panthoides cleanthes antipater tarsus made use second third proposition demonstrate first proposition false
chrysippus other hand agreed diodorus everything true event past necessary attacked diodorus' view possible must either true will true
thus made use first third proposition demonstrate second proposition false
