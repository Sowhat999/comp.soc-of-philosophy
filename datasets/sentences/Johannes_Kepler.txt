grandfather sebald kepler lord mayor town time johannes born two brothers sister kepler family fortune decline
father heinrich kepler earned precarious living mercenary left family johannes five years old
believed died eighty years' war netherlands
mother katharina guldenmann inn-keeper's daughter healer herbalist
born prematurely johannes claimed weak sickly child
nevertheless often impressed travelers grandfather's inn phenomenal mathematical faculty
introduced astronomy early age developed love span entire life
age six observed great comet 1577 writing taken [his] mother high place look
age nine observed another astronomical event lunar eclipse 1580 recording remembered being called outdoors see moon appeared quite red
however childhood smallpox left weak vision crippled hands limiting ability observational aspects astronomy
1589 after moving through grammar school latin school seminary maulbronn kepler attended tübinger stift university tübingen
there studied philosophy under vitus müller theology under jacob heerbrand student philipp melanchthon wittenberg also taught michael maestlin while student until became chancellor tübingen 1590
proved himself superb mathematician earned reputation skillful astrologer casting horoscopes fellow students
under instruction michael maestlin tübingen's professor mathematics 1583 1631 learned both ptolemaic system copernican system planetary motion
became copernican time
student disputation defended heliocentrism both theoretical theological perspective maintaining sun principal source motive power universe
despite desire become minister near end studies kepler recommended position teacher mathematics astronomy protestant school graz
accepted position april 1594 age 23
graz 1594–1600 mysterium cosmographicum kepler's platonic solid model solar system mysterium cosmographicum 1596 johannes kepler's first major astronomical work mysterium cosmographicum cosmographic mystery first published defense copernican system
kepler claimed epiphany july 19 1595 while teaching graz demonstrating periodic conjunction saturn jupiter zodiac realized regular polygons bound inscribed circumscribed circle definite ratios reasoned might geometrical basis universe
after failing find unique arrangement polygons fit known astronomical observations even extra planets added system kepler began experimenting 3-dimensional polyhedra
found each five platonic solids inscribed circumscribed spherical orbs nesting these solids each encased sphere within another produce six layers corresponding six known planets—mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn
ordering solids selectively—octahedron icosahedron dodecahedron tetrahedron cube—kepler found spheres placed intervals corresponding relative sizes each planet's path assuming planets circle sun
kepler also found formula relating size each planet's orb length orbital period inner outer planets ratio increase orbital period twice difference orb radius
however kepler later rejected formula because precise enough
close-up inner section model indicated title kepler thought revealed god's geometrical plan universe
much kepler's enthusiasm copernican system stemmed theological convictions connection physical spiritual universe itself image god sun corresponding father stellar sphere son intervening space holy spirit
first manuscript mysterium contained extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism biblical passages seemed support geocentrism
support mentor michael maestlin kepler received permission tübingen university senate publish manuscript pending removal bible exegesis addition simpler understandable description copernican system well kepler's new ideas
mysterium published late 1596 kepler received copies began sending them prominent astronomers patrons early 1597 widely read established kepler's reputation highly skilled astronomer
effusive dedication powerful patrons well men controlled position graz also provided crucial doorway patronage system
though details modified light later work kepler never relinquished platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology mysterium cosmographicum
subsequent main astronomical works sense further developments concerned finding precise inner outer dimensions spheres calculating eccentricities planetary orbits within
1621 kepler published expanded second edition mysterium half long again first detailing footnotes corrections improvements achieved 25 years since first publication
terms impact mysterium seen important first step modernizing theory proposed nicolaus copernicus de revolutionibus
whilst copernicus sought advance heliocentric system book resorted ptolemaic devices viz
epicycles eccentric circles order explain change planets' orbital speed also continued use point reference center earth's orbit rather sun aid calculation order confuse reader diverging too much ptolemy
modern astronomy owes much mysterium cosmographicum despite flaws main thesis since represents first step cleansing copernican system remnants ptolemaic theory still clinging
marriage barbara müller portraits kepler wife oval medallions december 1595 kepler introduced barbara müller 23-year-old widow twice over young daughter regina lorenz began courting her
müller heiress estates her late husbands also daughter successful mill owner
her father jobst initially opposed marriage despite kepler's nobility though inherited grandfather's nobility kepler's poverty made unacceptable match
jobst relented after kepler completed work mysterium engagement nearly fell apart while kepler away tending details publication
however protestant officials—who helped set up match—pressured müllers honor their agreement
barbara johannes married april 27 1597
first years their marriage keplers two children heinrich susanna both whom died infancy

house johannes kepler barbara müller gössendorf near graz 1597–1599 other research following publication mysterium blessing graz school inspectors kepler began ambitious program extend elaborate work
planned four additional books stationary aspects universe sun fixed stars planets their motions physical nature planets formation geographical features focused especially earth effects heavens earth include atmospheric optics meteorology astrology
also sought opinions many astronomers whom sent mysterium among them reimarus ursus nicolaus reimers bär—the imperial mathematician rudolph ii bitter rival tycho brahe
ursus reply directly republished kepler's flattering letter pursue priority dispute over now called tychonic system tycho
despite black mark tycho also began corresponding kepler starting harsh legitimate critique kepler's system among host objections tycho took issue use inaccurate numerical data taken copernicus
through their letters tycho kepler discussed broad range astronomical problems dwelling lunar phenomena copernican theory particularly theological viability
without significantly accurate data tycho's observatory kepler no way address many these issues
instead turned attention chronology harmony numerological relationships among music mathematics physical world their astrological consequences
assuming earth possess soul property later invoke explain how sun causes motion planets established speculative system connecting astrological aspects astronomical distances weather other earthly phenomena
1599 however again felt work limited inaccuracy available data—just growing religious tension also threatening continued employment graz
december year tycho invited kepler visit prague january 1600 before even received invitation kepler set off hopes tycho's patronage solve philosophical problems well social financial ones
prague 1600–1612 work tycho brahe tycho brahe february 4 1600 kepler met tycho brahe assistants franz tengnagel longomontanus benátky nad jizerou 35 km prague site tycho's new observatory being constructed
over next two months stayed guest analyzing tycho's observations mars tycho guarded data closely impressed kepler's theoretical ideas soon allowed access
kepler planned test theory mysterium cosmographicum based mars data estimated work take up two years since allowed simply copy data own use
help johannes jessenius kepler attempted negotiate formal employment arrangement tycho negotiations broke down angry argument kepler left prague april 6
kepler tycho soon reconciled eventually reached agreement salary living arrangements june kepler returned home graz collect family
political religious difficulties graz dashed hopes returning immediately brahe hopes continuing astronomical studies kepler sought appointment mathematician archduke ferdinand
end kepler composed essay—dedicated ferdinand—in proposed force-based theory lunar motion terra inest virtus quae lunam ciet there force earth causes moon move
though essay earn place ferdinand's court detail new method measuring lunar eclipses applied during july 10 eclipse graz
these observations formed basis explorations laws optics culminate astronomiae pars optica
august 2 1600 after refusing convert catholicism kepler family banished graz
several months later kepler returned now rest household prague
through most 1601 supported directly tycho assigned analyzing planetary observations writing tract against tycho's then deceased rival ursus
september tycho secured commission collaborator new project proposed emperor rudolphine tables should replace prutenic tables erasmus reinhold
two days after tycho's unexpected death october 24 1601 kepler appointed successor imperial mathematician responsibility complete unfinished work
next years imperial mathematician most productive life
kepler took tycho brahe's observation logs after tycho's death
allowed kepler use them scientific purposes instead letting brahe family lock them up unused
advisor emperor rudolph ii kepler's primary obligation imperial mathematician provide astrological advice emperor
though kepler took dim view attempts contemporary astrologers precisely predict future divine specific events casting well-received detailed horoscopes friends family patrons since time student tübingen
addition horoscopes allies foreign leaders emperor sought kepler's advice times political trouble
rudolph actively interested work many court scholars including numerous alchemists kept up kepler's work physical astronomy well
officially acceptable religious doctrines prague catholic utraquist kepler's position imperial court allowed practice lutheran faith unhindered
emperor nominally provided ample income family difficulties over-extended imperial treasury meant actually getting hold enough money meet financial obligations continual struggle
partly because financial troubles life home barbara unpleasant marred bickering bouts sickness
court life however brought kepler contact other prominent scholars johannes matthäus wackher von wackhenfels jost bürgi david fabricius martin bachazek johannes brengger among others astronomical work proceeded rapidly
astronomiae pars optica plate astronomiae pars optica illustrating structure eyes slowly continued analyzing tycho's mars observations—now available their entirety—and began slow process tabulating rudolphine tables kepler also picked up investigation laws optics lunar essay 1600
both lunar solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena such unexpected shadow sizes red color total lunar eclipse reportedly unusual light surrounding total solar eclipse
related issues atmospheric refraction applied astronomical observations
through most 1603 kepler paused other work focus optical theory resulting manuscript presented emperor january 1604 published astronomiae pars optica optical part astronomy
kepler described inverse-square law governing intensity light reflection flat curved mirrors principles pinhole cameras well astronomical implications optics such parallax apparent sizes heavenly bodies
also extended study optics human eye generally considered neuroscientists first recognize images projected inverted reversed eye's lens onto retina
solution dilemma particular importance kepler see pertaining optics although suggest image later corrected hollows brain due activity soul
today astronomiae pars optica generally recognized foundation modern optics though law refraction conspicuously absent
respect beginnings projective geometry kepler introduced idea continuous change mathematical entity work
argued focus conic section allowed move along line joining foci geometric form morph degenerate another
way ellipse becomes parabola focus moves toward infinity two foci ellipse merge another circle formed
foci hyperbola merge another hyperbola becomes pair straight lines
also assumed straight line extended infinity will meet itself single point infinity thus having properties large circle
idea later utilized pascal leibniz monge poncelet among others became known geometric continuity law principle continuity
supernova 1604 remnant kepler's supernova sn 1604 october 1604 bright new evening star sn 1604 appeared kepler believe rumors until saw himself
kepler began systematically observing nova
astrologically end 1603 marked beginning fiery trigon start 800-year cycle great conjunctions astrologers associated two previous such periods rise charlemagne c
800 years earlier birth christ c
1600 years earlier thus expected events great portent especially regarding emperor
context imperial mathematician astrologer emperor kepler described new star two years later de stella nova
kepler addressed star's astronomical properties while taking skeptical approach many astrological interpretations then circulating
noted fading luminosity speculated origin used lack observed parallax argue sphere fixed stars further undermining doctrine immutability heavens idea accepted since aristotle celestial spheres perfect unchanging
birth new star implied variability heavens
appendix kepler also discussed recent chronology work polish historian laurentius suslyga calculated suslyga correct accepted timelines four years behind then star bethlehem—analogous present new star—would coincided first great conjunction earlier 800-year cycle
location stella nova foot ophiuchus marked n grid squares down 4 over left
astronomia nova extended line research culminated astronomia nova new astronomy—including first two laws planetary motion—began analysis under tycho's direction mars' orbit
kepler calculated recalculated various approximations mars' orbit using equant mathematical tool copernicus eliminated system eventually creating model generally agreed tycho's observations within two arcminutes average measurement error
satisfied complex still slightly inaccurate result certain points model differed data up eight arcminutes
wide array traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed kepler set trying fit ovoid orbit data
within kepler's religious view cosmos sun symbol god father source motive force solar system
physical basis kepler drew analogy william gilbert's theory magnetic soul earth de magnete 1600 own work optics
kepler supposed motive power motive species radiated sun weakens distance causing faster slower motion planets move closer farther
perhaps assumption entailed mathematical relationship restore astronomical order
based measurements aphelion perihelion earth mars created formula planet's rate motion inversely proportional distance sun
verifying relationship throughout orbital cycle however required very extensive calculation simplify task late 1602 kepler reformulated proportion terms geometry planets sweep out equal areas equal times—kepler's second law planetary motion
diagram geocentric trajectory mars through several periods apparent retrograde motion
astronomia nova chapter 1609
then set calculating entire orbit mars using geometrical rate law assuming egg-shaped ovoid orbit
after approximately 40 failed attempts early 1605 last hit upon idea ellipse previously assumed too simple solution earlier astronomers overlooked
finding elliptical orbit fit mars data immediately concluded planets move ellipses sun focus—kepler's first law planetary motion
because employed no calculating assistants however extend mathematical analysis beyond mars
end year completed manuscript astronomia nova though published until 1609 due legal disputes over use tycho's observations property heirs
dioptrice somnium manuscript other work years following completion astronomia nova most kepler's research focused preparations rudolphine tables comprehensive set ephemerides specific predictions planet star positions based table though neither completed many years
also attempted unsuccessfully begin collaboration italian astronomer giovanni antonio magini
other work dealt chronology especially dating events life jesus astrology especially criticism dramatic predictions catastrophe such those helisaeus roeslin
kepler roeslin engaged series published attacks counter-attacks while physician philip feselius published work dismissing astrology altogether roeslin's work particular
response kepler saw excesses astrology hand overzealous rejection other kepler prepared tertius interveniens [third-party interventions]
nominally work—presented common patron roeslin feselius—was neutral mediation feuding scholars also set out kepler's general views value astrology including hypothesized mechanisms interaction planets individual souls
while kepler considered most traditional rules methods astrology evil-smelling dung industrious hen scrapes there occasional grain-seed indeed even pearl gold nugget found conscientious scientific astrologer
conversely sir oliver lodge observed kepler somewhat disdainful astrology kepler continually attacking throwing sarcasm astrology thing people pay after fashion lived

museum first months 1610 galileo galilei—using powerful new telescope—discovered four satellites orbiting jupiter
upon publishing account sidereus nuncius [starry messenger] galileo sought opinion kepler part bolster credibility observations
kepler responded enthusiastically short published reply dissertatio cum nuncio sidereo [conversation starry messenger]
endorsed galileo's observations offered range speculations meaning implications galileo's discoveries telescopic methods astronomy optics well cosmology astrology
later year kepler published own telescopic observations moons narratio de jovis satellitibus providing further support galileo
kepler's disappointment however galileo never published reactions any astronomia nova
after hearing galileo's telescopic discoveries kepler also started theoretical experimental investigation telescopic optics using telescope borrowed duke ernest cologne
resulting manuscript completed september 1610 published dioptrice 1611
kepler set out theoretical basis double-convex converging lenses double-concave diverging lenses—and how combined produce galilean telescope—as well concepts real vs
virtual images upright vs
inverted images effects focal length magnification reduction
also described improved telescope—now known astronomical keplerian telescope—in two convex lenses produce higher magnification galileo's combination convex concave lenses
diagrams strena seu de nive sexangula illustrating kepler conjecture around 1611 kepler circulated manuscript eventually published posthumously somnium [the dream]
part purpose somnium describe practicing astronomy like perspective another planet show feasibility non-geocentric system
manuscript disappeared after changing hands several times described fantastic trip moon part allegory part autobiography part treatise interplanetary travel sometimes described first work science fiction
years later distorted version story may instigated witchcraft trial against mother mother narrator consults demon learn means space travel
following her eventual acquittal kepler composed 223 footnotes story—several times longer actual text—which explained allegorical aspects well considerable scientific content particularly regarding lunar geography hidden within text

kepler pioneers mathematical applications infinitesimals see law continuity
personal political troubles 1611 growing political-religious tension prague came head
emperor rudolph—whose health failing—was forced abdicate king bohemia brother matthias
both sides sought kepler's astrological advice opportunity used deliver conciliatory political advice little reference stars except general statements discourage drastic action
however clear kepler's future prospects court matthias dim
also year barbara kepler contracted hungarian spotted fever then began having seizures
barbara recovering kepler's three children fell sick smallpox friedrich 6 died
following son's death kepler sent letters potential patrons württemberg padua
university tübingen württemberg concerns over kepler's perceived calvinist heresies violation augsburg confession formula concord prevented return
university padua—on recommendation departing galileo—sought kepler fill mathematics professorship kepler preferring keep family german territory instead travelled austria arrange position teacher district mathematician linz
however barbara relapsed illness died shortly after kepler's return
kepler postponed move linz remained prague until rudolph's death early 1612 though political upheaval religious tension family tragedy along legal dispute over wife's estate kepler no research
instead pieced together chronology manuscript eclogae chronicae correspondence earlier work
upon succession holy roman emperor matthias re-affirmed kepler's position salary imperial mathematician allowed move linz
linz elsewhere 1612–1630 statue kepler linz linz kepler's primary responsibilities beyond completing rudolphine tables teaching district school providing astrological astronomical services
first years there enjoyed financial security religious freedom relative life prague—though excluded eucharist lutheran church over theological scruples

second marriage october 30 1613 kepler married 24-year-old susanna reuttinger
following death first wife barbara kepler considered different matches over two years decision process formalized later marriage problem
eventually returned reuttinger fifth match won me over love humble loyalty economy household diligence love she gave stepchildren
first three children marriage margareta regina katharina sebald died childhood
three survived adulthood cordula born 1621 fridmar born 1623 hildebert born 1625

epitome copernican astronomy calendars witch trial mother details topic see epitome astronomiae copernicanae
kepler's figure 'm' epitome showing world belonging just any number similar stars
since completing astronomia nova kepler intended compose astronomy textbook
1615 completed first three volumes epitome astronomiae copernicanae epitome copernican astronomy first volume books i-iii printed 1617 second book iv 1620 third books v-vii 1621
despite title referred simply heliocentrism kepler's textbook culminated own ellipse-based system
epitome became kepler's most influential work
contained three laws planetary motion attempted explain heavenly motions through physical causes
though explicitly extended first two laws planetary motion applied mars astronomia nova planets well moon medicean satellites jupiter explain how elliptical orbits derived observational data
spin-off rudolphine tables related ephemerides kepler published astrological calendars very popular helped offset costs producing other work—especially support imperial treasury withheld
calendars—six 1617 1624—kepler forecast planetary positions weather well political events latter often cannily accurate thanks keen grasp contemporary political theological tensions
1624 however escalation those tensions ambiguity prophecies meant political trouble kepler himself final calendar publicly burned graz
geometrical harmonies perfect solids harmonices mundi 1619 1615 ursula reingold woman financial dispute kepler's brother christoph claimed kepler's mother katharina made her sick evil brew
dispute escalated 1617 katharina accused witchcraft witchcraft trials relatively common central europe time
beginning august 1620 she imprisoned fourteen months
she released october 1621 thanks part extensive legal defense drawn up kepler
accusers no stronger evidence rumors
katharina subjected territio verbalis graphic description torture awaiting her witch final attempt make her confess
throughout trial kepler postponed other work focus harmonic theory
result published 1619 harmonices mundi harmony world
harmonices mundi main article harmonices mundi kepler convinced geometrical things provided creator model decorating whole world
harmony attempted explain proportions natural world—particularly astronomical astrological aspects—in terms music
central set harmonies musica universalis music spheres studied pythagoras ptolemy many others before kepler fact soon after publishing harmonices mundi kepler embroiled priority dispute robert fludd recently published own harmonic theory
kepler began exploring regular polygons regular solids including figures come known kepler's solids
there extended harmonic analysis music meteorology astrology harmony resulted tones made souls heavenly bodies—and case astrology interaction those tones human souls
final portion work book v kepler dealt planetary motions especially relationships orbital velocity orbital distance sun
similar relationships used other astronomers kepler—with tycho's data own astronomical theories—treated them much precisely attached new physical significance them
among many other harmonies kepler articulated came known third law planetary motion
then tried many combinations until discovered approximately square periodic times each other cubes mean distances
although gives date epiphany march 1618 does give any details how arrived conclusion
however wider significance planetary dynamics purely kinematical law realized until 1660 s
conjoined christiaan huygens' newly discovered law centrifugal force enabled isaac newton edmund halley perhaps christopher wren robert hooke demonstrate independently presumed gravitational attraction sun planets decreased square distance them
refuted traditional assumption scholastic physics power gravitational attraction remained constant distance whenever applied two bodies such assumed kepler also galileo mistaken universal law gravitational fall uniformly accelerated also galileo's student borrelli 1666 celestial mechanics
william gilbert after experimenting magnets decided center earth huge magnet
theory led kepler think magnetic force sun drove planets their own orbits
interesting explanation planetary motion unfortunately kepler wrong
before scientists find right answer needed know motion
rudolphine tables last years kepler's horoscope general wallenstein 1623 kepler last completed rudolphine tables time considered major work
however due publishing requirements emperor negotiations tycho brahe's heir printed until 1627
meantime religious tension — root ongoing thirty years' war — once again put kepler family jeopardy
1625 agents catholic counter-reformation placed most kepler's library under seal 1626 city linz besieged
kepler moved ulm arranged printing tables own expense
1628 following military successes emperor ferdinand's armies under general wallenstein kepler became official advisor wallenstein
though general's court astrologer per se kepler provided astronomical calculations wallenstein's astrologers occasionally horoscopes himself
final years kepler spent much time traveling imperial court prague linz ulm temporary home sagan finally regensburg
soon after arriving regensburg kepler fell ill
died november 15 1630 buried there burial site lost after swedish army destroyed churchyard
kepler's self-authored poetic epitaph survived times mensus eram coelos nunc terrae metior umbras mens coelestis erat corporis umbra iacet
measured skies now shadows measure skybound mind earthbound body rests
reception astronomy kepler's laws immediately accepted
several major figures such galileo rené descartes completely ignored kepler's astronomia nova
many astronomers including kepler's teacher michael maestlin objected kepler's introduction physics astronomy
adopted compromise positions
ismael boulliau accepted elliptical orbits replaced kepler's area law uniform motion respect empty focus ellipse while seth ward used elliptical orbit motions defined equant
several astronomers tested kepler's theory various modifications against astronomical observations
two transits venus mercury across face sun provided sensitive tests theory under circumstances these planets normally observed
case transit mercury 1631 kepler extremely uncertain parameters mercury advised observers look transit day before after predicted date
pierre gassendi observed transit date predicted confirmation kepler's prediction
first observation transit mercury
however attempt observe transit venus just month later unsuccessful due inaccuracies rudolphine tables
gassendi realize visible most europe including paris
jeremiah horrocks observed 1639 venus transit used own observations adjust parameters keplerian model predicted transit then built apparatus observe transit
remained firm advocate keplerian model
epitome copernican astronomy read astronomers throughout europe following kepler's death main vehicle spreading kepler's ideas
1630 1650 most widely used astronomy textbook winning many converts ellipse-based astronomy
however few adopted ideas physical basis celestial motions
late 17 th century number physical astronomy theories drawing kepler's work—notably those giovanni alfonso borelli robert hooke—began incorporate attractive forces though quasi-spiritual motive species postulated kepler cartesian concept inertia
culminated isaac newton's principia mathematica 1687 newton derived kepler's laws planetary motion force-based theory universal gravitation
historical cultural legacy monument tycho brahe kepler prague czech republic gdr stamp featuring kepler history science beyond role historical development astronomy natural philosophy kepler loomed large philosophy historiography science

these other histories written enlightenment perspective treated kepler's metaphysical religious arguments skepticism disapproval later romantic-era natural philosophers viewed these elements central success
william whewell influential history inductive sciences 1837 found kepler archetype inductive scientific genius philosophy inductive sciences 1840 whewell held kepler up embodiment most advanced forms scientific method
similarly ernst friedrich apelt—the first extensively study kepler's manuscripts after their purchase catherine great—identified kepler key revolution sciences
apelt saw kepler's mathematics aesthetic sensibility physical ideas theology part unified system thought produced first extended analysis kepler's life work
alexandre koyré's work kepler after apelt first major milestone historical interpretations kepler's cosmology influence
1930 s 1940 s koyré number others first generation professional historians science described scientific revolution central event history science kepler perhaps central figure revolution
koyré placed kepler's theorization rather empirical work center intellectual transformation ancient modern world-views
since 1960 s volume historical kepler scholarship expanded greatly including studies astrology meteorology geometrical methods role religious views work literary rhetorical methods interaction broader cultural philosophical currents time even role historian science
philosophers science—such charles sanders peirce norwood russell hanson stephen toulmin karl popper—have repeatedly turned kepler examples incommensurability analogical reasoning falsification many other philosophical concepts found kepler's work
physicist wolfgang pauli even used kepler's priority dispute robert fludd explore implications analytical psychology scientific investigation

302–04 1621 earlier kepler recognized jupiter's moons obey third law
kepler contended rotating massive bodies communicate their rotation their satellites satellites swept around central body thus rotation sun drives revolutions planets rotation earth drives revolution moon
kepler's era no any evidence jupiter's rotation
however kepler argued force central body causes satellites revolve around weakens distance consequently satellites farther central body revolve slower
kepler noted jupiter's moons obeyed pattern inferred similar force responsible
also noted orbital periods semi-major axes jupiter's satellites roughly related 3/2 power law orbits six then known planets
however relation approximate periods jupiter's moons known within few percent their modern values moons' semi-major axes determined less accurately

original 4 confirmatur vero fides hujus rei comparatione quatuor jovialium et jovis cum sex planetis et sole
etsi enim de corpore jovis et ipsum circa suum axem convertatur non ea documenta habemus quae nobis suppetunt corporibus terrae et praecipue solis quippe sensu ipso illud sensus testatur plane ut est cum sex planetis circa solem sic etiam se rem habere cum quatuor jovialibus ut circa corpus jovis quilibet quo longius ab illo potest excurrere hoc tardius redeat et id quidem proportione non eadem sed majore hoc est sescupla proportionis intervallorum cujusque jove quae plane ipsissima est qua utebantur supra sex planetae
intervalla enim quatuor jovialium jove prodit marius suo mundo joviali ista 3 5 13 vel 14 galilaeo
periodica vero tempora prodit idem marius ista dies

translation 4 however credibility [argument] proved comparison four [moons] jupiter jupiter six planets sun
because regarding body jupiter whether turns around axis don't proofs suffices us [regarding rotation body earth especially sun certainly [as reason proves us] reason attests just clearly [true] among six planets around sun also among four [moons] jupiter because around body jupiter any [satellite] go farther orbits slower even [orbit's period] same proportion greater [than distance jupiter] 3/2 sescupla proportion each distances jupiter clearly very [proportion] [is used for] six planets above
[book] world jupiter [mundus jovialis 1614] [simon] mayr [1573–1624] presents these distances jupiter four [moons] jupiter 3 5 13 14 [according to] galileo
mayr presents their time periods day 18 1/2 hours 3 days 13 1/3 hours 7 days 3 hours 16 days 18 hours [of these data] proportion greater double thus greater [the proportion] distances 3 5 13 14 although less [the proportion] squares double proportions distances namely 9 25 64 169 196 just [a power of] 3/2 also greater less 2
