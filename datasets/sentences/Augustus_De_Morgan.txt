mother elizabeth dodson 1776-1856 descended james dodson computed table anti-logarithms numbers corresponding exact logarithms
augustus de morgan became blind eye month two after born
family moved england augustus seven months old
father grandfather both born india de morgan used say neither english nor scottish nor irish briton unattached using technical term applied undergraduate oxford cambridge member any colleges
de morgan ten years old father died
de morgan resided various places southwest england her son received elementary education various schools no great account
mathematical talents went unnoticed until fourteen family-friend discovered making elaborate drawing figure euclid ruler compasses
she explained aim euclid augustus gave initiation demonstration
received secondary education mr
parsons fellow oriel college oxford appreciated classics better mathematics
mother active ardent member church england desired her son should become clergyman time de morgan begun show non-conforming disposition
university education 1823 age sixteen entered trinity college cambridge came under influence george peacock william whewell became lifelong friends former derived interest renovation algebra latter interest renovation logic—the two subjects future life work
college tutor john philips higman frs 1793–1855
college played flute recreation prominent musical clubs
love knowledge own sake interfered training great mathematical race consequence came out fourth wrangler
entitled degree bachelor arts take higher degree master arts thereby become eligible fellowship then necessary pass theological test
signing any such test de morgan felt strong objection although brought up church england
1875 theological tests academic degrees abolished universities oxford cambridge
london university no career open own university decided go bar took up residence london much preferred teaching mathematics reading law
time movement founding london university now university college london took shape
two ancient universities oxford cambridge guarded theological tests no jew dissenter outside church england enter student still less appointed any office
body liberal-minded men resolved meet difficulty establishing london university principle religious neutrality
de morgan then years age appointed professor mathematics
introductory lecture study mathematics discourse upon mental education permanent value recently reprinted united states
london university new institution relations council management senate professors body students well defined
dispute arose professor anatomy students consequence action taken council several professors resigned headed de morgan
another professor mathematics appointed then drowned few years later
de morgan shown himself prince teachers invited return chair thereafter became continuous centre labours thirty years
same body reformers—headed lord brougham scotsman eminent both science politics instituted london university—founded same time society diffusion useful knowledge
object spread scientific other knowledge means cheap clearly written treatises best writers time
most voluminous effective writers de morgan
great work differential integral calculus published society one-sixth articles penny cyclopedia published society issued penny numbers
de morgan came reside london found congenial friend william frend notwithstanding mathematical heresy negative quantities
both arithmeticians actuaries their religious views somewhat similar
frend lived then suburb london country-house formerly occupied daniel defoe isaac watts
de morgan flute welcome visitor
london university de morgan professor different institution university london
university london founded ten years later government purpose granting degrees after examination without any qualification residence
london university affiliated teaching college university london name changed university college
university london success examining body teaching university demanded
de morgan highly successful teacher mathematics
plan lecture hour close each lecture give out number problems examples illustrative subject lectured students required sit down them bring results looked over returned revised before next lecture
de morgan's opinion thorough comprehension mental assimilation great principles far outweighed importance any merely analytical dexterity application half-understood principles particular cases
during period also promoted work self-taught indian mathematician ramchundra called de morgan's ramanujan
supervised publication london ramchundra's book treatise problems maxima minima 1859
introduction book acknowledged being aware indian tradition logic although known whether any influence own work
family augustus seven children four whom survived adulthood
eliza 1801-1836 married lewis hensley surgeon living bath
augustus 1806-1871 george 1808-1890 barrister-at-law married josephine daughter vice admiral josiah coghill 3 rd baronet coghill campbell greig 1811-1876 surgeon middlesex hospital autumn 1837 married sophia elizabeth 1809-1892 eldest daughter william frend 1757-1841 sarah blackburne 1779-? granddaughter francis blackburne 1705-1787 archdeacon cleveland
de morgan three sons four daughters including fairytale author mary de morgan
eldest son potter william de morgan
second son george acquired great distinction mathematics university college university london
another like-minded alumnus conceived idea founding mathematical society london mathematical papers received royal society actually read discussed
first meeting held university college de morgan first president son first secretary
beginning london mathematical society
retirement death augustus de morgan
1866 chair mental philosophy university college fell vacant
james martineau unitarian clergyman professor mental philosophy recommended formally senate council council there objected unitarian clergyman others objected theistic philosophy
layman school bain spencer appointed
de morgan considered old standard religious neutrality hauled down forthwith resigned
now 60 years age
pupils secured pension £500 p
misfortunes followed
two years later son george — younger bernoulli augustus loved hear called allusion eminent father-and-son mathematicians name — died
blow followed death daughter
five years after resignation university college de morgan died nervous prostration 18 march 1871
mathematical work de morgan brilliant witty writer whether controversialist correspondent
time there flourished two sir william hamiltons often conflated
sir william hamilton 9 th baronet title inherited scotsman professor logic metaphysics university edinburgh other knight won title irishman professor astronomy university dublin
baronet contributed logic especially doctrine quantification predicate knight whose full name william rowan hamilton contributed mathematics especially geometric algebra first described quaternions
de morgan interested work both corresponded both correspondence scotsman ended public controversy whereas irishman marked friendship terminated death
letters rowan de morgan says known unto you discovered you other sir w
reciprocal polars respect me intellectually morally scottish baronet polar bear you going say polar gentleman
send bit investigation edinburgh w
ilk says took
send you you take me generalize glance bestow thus generalized upon society large make me second discoverer known theorem
correspondence de morgan hamilton mathematician extended over twenty-four years contains discussions mathematical matters also subjects general interest
marked geniality part hamilton wit part de morgan
following specimen hamilton my copy berkeley's work mine like berkeley you know am irishman
de morgan replied your phrase 'my copy mine' bull
perfectly good english use same word two different senses sentence particularly there usage
incongruity language no bull expresses meaning
incongruity ideas case irishman pulling up rope finding finish cried out somebody cut off other end genuine bull
de morgan full personal peculiarities
occasion installation friend lord brougham rector university edinburgh senate offered confer honorary degree ll
declined honour misnomer
once printed name augustus de morgan h - o - m - o - p - - u - c - - r - u - m - l - - t - e - r - - r - u - m latin man few letters
[citation needed] disliked provinces outside london while family enjoyed seaside men science having good time meeting british association country remained hot dusty libraries metropolis
felt like socrates declared farther athens farther happiness
never sought become fellow royal society never attended meeting society no ideas sympathies common physical philosopher
attitude possibly due physical infirmity prevented being either observer experimenter
never voted election never visited house commons tower london westminster abbey
writings de morgan published form collected works form small library example writings useful knowledge society
mainly through efforts peacock whewell philosophical society inaugurated cambridge transactions de morgan contributed four memoirs foundations algebra equal number formal logic
best presentation view algebra found volume entitled trigonometry double algebra published 1849 earlier view formal logic found volume published 1847
most distinctive work styled budget paradoxes originally appeared letters columns athenæum journal revised extended de morgan last years life published posthumously widow
george peacock's theory algebra much improved
gregory younger member cambridge school laid stress permanence equivalent forms permanence certain formal laws
new theory algebra science symbols their laws combination carried logical issue de morgan doctrine subject still followed english algebraists general
thus george chrystal founds textbook algebra de morgan's theory although attentive reader may remark practically abandons takes up subject infinite series
de morgan's theory stated volume trigonometry double algebra book ii chapter ii headed symbolic algebra writes abandoning meanings symbols also abandon those words describe them
thus >addition present sound void sense
mode combination represented receives meaning also will word addition
most important student should bear mind exception no word nor sign arithmetic algebra atom meaning throughout chapter object symbols their laws combination giving symbolic algebra may hereafter become grammar hundred distinct significant algebras
any assert might mean reward punishment etc
might stand virtues vices reader might believe contradict pleases—but out chapter
exception above noted share meaning sign placed two symbols
indicates two symbols same resulting meaning whatever different steps attained
quantities same amount quantity operations same effect etc
trigonometry double algebra de morgan's work entitled trigonometry double algebra consists two parts former treatise trigonometry latter treatise generalized algebra called double algebra
first stage development algebra arithmetic numbers appear symbols operations such etc
next stage universal arithmetic letters appear instead numbers denote numbers universally processes conducted without knowing values symbols
let denote any numbers then such expression may impossible universal arithmetic there proviso provided operation possible
third stage single algebra symbol may denote quantity forwards quantity backwards adequately represented segments straight line passing through origin
negative quantities then no longer impossible represented backward segment
impossibility still remains latter part such expression arises solution quadratic equation
fourth stage double algebra
algebraic symbol denotes general segment line given plane
double symbol because involves two specifications namely length direction interpreted denoting quadrant
expression then represents line plane having abscissa ordinate
argand warren carried double algebra far—but unable interpret theory such expression
de morgan attempted reducing such expression form considered shown reduced
remarkable fact double algebra satisfies fundamental laws above enumerated every apparently impossible combination symbols interpreted looks like complete form algebra
chapter 6 introduced hyperbolic functions discussed connection common hyperbolic trigonometry
above theory true next stage development ought triple algebra truly represents line given plane ought possible find third term added above represent line space
argand others guessed although contradicts truth established euler
de morgan many others worked hard problem nothing came until problem taken up hamilton
now see reason clearly symbol double algebra denotes length direction multiplier angle
angles confined plane
hence next stage will quadruple algebra axis plane made variable
gives answer first question double algebra nothing analytical plane trigonometry why found natural analysis alternating currents
de morgan never got far
died belief double algebra must remain full development conceptions arithmetic far those symbols concerned arithmetic immediately suggests
book ii chapter ii following above quoted passage theory symbolic algebra de morgan proceeds give inventory fundamental symbols algebra also inventory laws algebra
symbols letters these others derived
de morgan explains last these symbols represents writing latter expression superscript over after former
inventory fundamental laws expressed under fourteen heads them merely definitions
preceding list symbols matter under first these heads
laws proper may reduced following admits independent another unsymmetrical character exponential operation want connecting process
renders necessary state them separately identity laws
law signs
commutative law
distributive law
index laws
de morgan professes give complete inventory laws symbols algebra must obey says any system symbols obeys these rules no others—except formed combination these rules—and uses preceding symbols no others—except new symbols invented abbreviation combinations these symbols—is symbolic algebra
point view none above principles rules formal laws arbitrarily chosen relations algebraic symbols must subject
does mention law already pointed out gregory namely afterwards given name law association
commutative law fails associative may hold good vice versa
unfortunate thing symbolist formalist universal arithmetic equal then commutative law full scope
why does give full scope? because foundations algebra after real formal material symbolic
formalists index operations exceedingly refractory consequence take no account them relegate them applied mathematics
[citation needed] give inventory laws symbols algebra must obey impossible task reminds little task those philosophers attempt give inventory priori knowledge mind
[citation needed][original research?] formal logic study mathematics revived university cambridge study logic
moving spirit whewell master trinity college whose principal writings history inductive sciences philosophy inductive sciences
doubtless de morgan influenced logical investigations whewell other influential contemporaries sir william rowan hamilton dublin george boole cork
de morgan's work formal logic published 1847 principally remarkable development numerically definite syllogism
followers aristotle say two particular propositions such m's a's m's b's nothing follows necessity relation a's b's
go further say order any relation a's b's may follow necessity middle term must taken universally premises
de morgan pointed out most m's a's most m's b's follows necessity a's b's formulated numerically definite syllogism puts principle exact quantitative form
suppose number m's m's a's m's b's then there least a's b's
suppose number souls board steamer 1000 500 saloon 700 lost
follows necessity least 700 + 500 - 1000 200 saloon passengers lost
single principle suffices prove validity aristotelian moods
therefore fundamental principle necessary reasoning
here then de morgan made great advance introducing quantification terms
time sir william hamilton teaching edinburgh doctrine quantification predicate correspondence sprang up
however de morgan soon perceived hamilton's quantification different character meant example substituting two forms whole whole whole part aristotelian form a's b's
hamilton thought placed keystone aristotelian arch phrased
although must curious arch stand 2000 years without keystone
consequence no room de morgan's innovations
accused de morgan plagiarism controversy raged years columns athenæum publications two writers
memoirs logic de morgan contributed transactions cambridge philosophical society subsequent publication book formal logic far most important contributions made science especially fourth memoir begins work broad field logic relatives
true field logician twentieth century work greatest importance done towards improving language facilitating thinking processes occur time practical life
identity difference two relations considered logician there many others equally deserving study such equality equivalence consanguinity affinity etc
budget paradoxes introduction budget paradoxes de morgan explains means word
great many individuals ever since rise mathematical method each himself attacked direct indirect consequences
shall call each these persons paradoxer system paradox
use word old sense paradox something apart general opinion either subject matter method conclusion
many things brought forward now called crotchets nearest word old paradox
there difference calling thing crotchet mean speak lightly necessary sense paradox
thus 16 th century many spoke earth's motion paradox copernicus held ingenuity theory very high esteem think even inclined towards
seventeenth century deprivation meaning took place england least
how sound paradoxer distinguished false paradoxer? de morgan supplies following test manner paradoxer will show himself sense nonsense will depend upon maintains upon whether made sufficient knowledge done others especially mode doing preliminary inventing knowledge himself
new knowledge any purpose must come contemplation old knowledge every matter concerns thought mechanical contrivance sometimes very often escapes rule
men now called discoverers every matter ruled thought men versed minds their predecessors learned before them
there exception
remember just before american association met indianapolis 1890 local newspapers heralded great discovery laid before assembled savants — young man living somewhere country squared circle
while meeting progress observed young man going roll paper hand
spoke me complained paper containing discovery received
asked whether object presenting paper get read printed published everyone might inform himself result assented readily
many men worked question their results tested fully printed benefit anyone read you informed yourself their results? there no assent sickly smile false paradoxer
budget consists review large collection paradoxical books de morgan accumulated own library partly purchase bookstands partly books sent review partly books sent authors
gives following classification squarers circle trisectors angle duplicators cube constructors perpetual motion subverters gravitation stagnators earth builders universe
you will still find specimens these classes new world new century
de morgan gives personal knowledge paradoxers
suspect know english class any man britain
never kept any reckoning know year another? — less late years earlier time? — talked five each year giving hundred fifty specimens
am sure my own fault thousand
nobody knows how swarm except those whom naturally resort
ranks occupations ages characters
very earnest people their purpose bona fide dissemination their paradoxes
great many — mass indeed — illiterate great many waste their means approaching penury
these discoverers despise another
paradoxer whom de morgan paid compliment achilles paid hector — drag round walls again again — james smith successful merchant liverpool
mode reasoning curious caricature reductio ad absurdum euclid
let then showed supposition every other value must absurd
consequently true value
following specimen de morgan's dragging round walls troy mr
smith continues write me long letters hints am answer
last 31 closely written sides note paper informs me reference my obstinate silence though think myself am thought others mathematical goliath resolved play mathematical snail keep within my shell
mathematical snail! cannot thing called regulates striking clock mean am make mr
smith sound true time day no means undertake upon clock gains 19 seconds odd every hour false quadrative value
ventures tell me pebbles sling simple truth common sense will ultimately crack my shell put me hors de combat
confusion images amusing goliath turning himself snail avoid james smith esq
mersey dock board put hors de combat pebbles sling
goliath crept snail shell david cracked philistine foot
there something like modesty implication crack-shell pebble yet taken effect might thought slinger time singing — thrice [and one-eighth] routed my foes thrice [and one-eighth] slew slain
region pure mathematics de morgan detect easily false true paradox proficient field physics
father-in-law paradoxer wife paradoxer opinion physical philosophers de morgan himself scarcely escaped
wife book describing phenomena spiritualism table-rapping table-turning etc
de morgan preface knew asserted facts believed others testimony pretend know whether caused spirits unknown unimagined origin
alternative left out ordinary material causes
faraday delivered lecture spiritualism laid down investigation ought set out idea physically possible impossible de morgan believe

1849 investigated clairvoyance impressed subject
later carried out paranormal investigations own home medium maria hayden
result these investigations later published wife sophia
de morgan believed career scientist might affected revealed interest study spiritualism helped publish book anonymously
book published 1863 titled matter spirit result ten years experience spirit manifestations
according historian janet oppenheim de morgan's wife sophia convinced spiritualist de morgan shared third way position spiritualist phenomena she defined wait-and-see position neither believer nor skeptic instead viewpoint methodology physical sciences does automatically exclude psychic phenomena such phenomena may explainable time possible existence natural forces yet physicists identified
preface matter spirit 1863 de morgan stated thinking very likely universe may contain few agencies—say half million—about no man knows anything suspect small proportion these agencies—say five thousand—may severally competent production [spiritualist] phenomena may quite up task among them
physical explanations seen easy miserably insufficient spiritualist hypothesis sufficient ponderously difficult
