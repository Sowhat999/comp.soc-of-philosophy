academy students françois daviet de foncenex
variational calculus lagrange founders calculus variations
starting 1754 worked problem tautochrone discovering method maximizing minimizing functionals way similar finding extrema functions
lagrange several letters leonhard euler 1754 1756 describing results
outlined δ-algorithm leading euler–lagrange equations variational calculus considerably simplifying euler's earlier analysis
lagrange also applied ideas problems classical mechanics generalizing results euler maupertuis
euler very impressed lagrange's results
stated characteristic courtesy withheld paper previously written covered same ground order young italian might time complete work claim undisputed invention new calculus however chivalric view disputed
lagrange published method two memoirs turin society 1762 1773
miscellanea taurinensia 1758 aid pupils mainly daviet de foncenex lagrange established society subsequently incorporated turin academy sciences most early writings found five volumes transactions usually known miscellanea taurinensia
many these elaborate papers
first volume contains paper theory propagation sound indicates mistake made newton obtains general differential equation motion integrates motion straight line
volume also contains complete solution problem string vibrating transversely paper points out lack generality solutions previously given brook taylor d'alembert euler arrives conclusion form curve any time t given equation
article concludes masterly discussion echoes beats compound sounds

after lavoisier's death 1794 largely owing lagrange's influence final choice unit system metre kilogram settled decimal subdivision finally accepted commission 1799
lagrange also founding members bureau des longitudes 1795
école normale 1795 lagrange appointed mathematical chair newly established école normale enjoyed brief existence four months
lectures there quite elementary contain nothing any special importance published because professors pledge themselves representatives people each other neither read nor repeat memory discourses ordered taken down shorthand order enable deputies see how professors acquitted themselves
école polytechnique 1794 lagrange appointed professor école polytechnique lectures there described mathematicians good fortune able attend them almost perfect both form matter
[citation needed] beginning merest elements led hearers until almost unknown themselves themselves extending bounds subject above impressed pupils advantage using general methods expressed symmetrical notation
lagrange does seem successful teacher

these mechanics called lagrangian mechanics
algebra greater number papers during time however contributed prussian academy sciences
several them deal questions algebra
discussion representations integers quadratic forms 1769 general algebraic forms 1770
tract theory elimination 1770
lagrange's theorem order subgroup h group g must divide order g
papers 1770 1771 general process solving algebraic equation any degree via lagrange resolvents
method fails give general formula solutions equation degree five higher because auxiliary equation involved higher degree original
significance method exhibits already known formulas solving equations second third fourth degrees manifestations single principle foundational galois theory
complete solution binomial equation any degree also treated these papers
1773 lagrange considered functional determinant order 3 special case jacobian
also proved expression volume tetrahedron vertices origin sixth absolute value determinant formed coordinates other three vertices
number theory several early papers also deal questions number theory
lagrange 1766–1769 first prove pell's equation nontrivial solution integers any non-square natural number n
proved theorem stated bachet without justification every positive integer sum four squares 1770
proved wilson's theorem any integer n>1 n prime n − 1! + multiple n 1771
papers 1773 1775 1777 gave demonstrations several results enunciated fermat previously proved
recherches d'arithmétique 1775 developed general theory binary quadratic forms handle general problem integer representable form
made contributions theory continued fractions
other mathematical work there also numerous articles various points analytical geometry
two them written rather later 1792 1793 reduced equations quadrics conicoids their canonical forms
during years 1772 1785 contributed long series papers created science partial differential equations
large part these results collected second edition euler's integral calculus published 1794
astronomy lastly there numerous papers problems astronomy
these most important following attempting solve general three-body problem consequent discovery two constant-pattern solutions collinear equilateral 1772
those solutions later seen explain now known lagrangian points
attraction ellipsoids 1773 founded maclaurin's work
secular equation moon 1773 also noticeable earliest introduction idea potential
potential body any point sum mass every element body divided distance point
lagrange showed potential body external point known attraction any direction once found
theory potential elaborated paper sent berlin 1777
motion nodes planet's orbit 1774
stability planetary orbits 1776
two papers method determining orbit comet three observations completely worked out 1778 1783 indeed proved practically available system calculating perturbations means mechanical quadratures formed basis most subsequent researches subject
determination secular periodic variations elements planets 1781–1784 upper limits assigned these agree closely those obtained later le verrier lagrange proceeded far knowledge then possessed masses planets permitted
three papers method interpolation 1783 1792 1793 part finite differences dealing therewith now same stage lagrange left
mécanique analytique over above these various papers composed great treatise mécanique analytique
lays down law virtual work fundamental principle aid calculus variations deduces whole mechanics both solids fluids
object book show subject implicitly included single principle give general formulae any particular result obtained
method generalized co-ordinates obtained result perhaps most brilliant result analysis
instead following motion each individual part material system d'alembert euler done showed determine configuration sufficient number variables whose number same degrees freedom possessed system then kinetic potential energies system expressed terms those variables differential equations motion thence deduced simple differentiation
example dynamics rigid system replaces consideration particular problem general equation now usually written form t represents kinetic energy v represents potential energy system
then presented now know method lagrange multipliers—though first time method published—as means solve equation
amongst other minor theorems here given may mention proposition kinetic energy imparted given impulses material system under given constraints maximum principle least action

somewhat similar method previously used john landen residual analysis published london 1758
lagrange believed thus get rid those difficulties connected use infinitely large infinitely small quantities philosophers objected usual treatment differential calculus
book divided three parts these first treats general theory functions gives algebraic proof taylor's theorem validity however open question second deals applications geometry third applications mechanics
another treatise same lines leçons sur le calcul des fonctions issued 1804 second edition 1806
book lagrange formulated celebrated method lagrange multipliers context problems variational calculus integral constraints
these works devoted differential calculus calculus variations may considered starting point researches cauchy jacobi weierstrass
infinitesimals later period lagrange fully embraced use infinitesimals preference founding differential calculus study algebraic forms preface second edition mécanique analytique issued 1811 justifies employment infinitesimals concludes saying grasped spirit infinitesimal method verified exactness results either geometrical method prime ultimate ratios analytical method derived functions may employ infinitely small quantities sure valuable means shortening simplifying our proofs
number theory résolution des équations numériques published 1798 also fruit lectures école polytechnique
there gives method approximating real roots equation means continued fractions enunciates several other theorems
note end shows how fermat's little theorem p prime prime p may applied give complete algebraic solution any binomial equation
also here explains how equation whose roots squares differences roots original equation may used give considerable information position nature those roots
celestial mechanics theory planetary motions formed subject most remarkable lagrange's berlin papers
1806 subject reopened poisson paper read before french academy showed lagrange's formulae led certain limits stability orbits
lagrange present now discussed whole subject afresh letter communicated academy 1808 explained how variation arbitrary constants periodical secular inequalities any system mutually interacting bodies determined
