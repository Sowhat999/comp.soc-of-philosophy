37 luciano canfora grande illusione del capitalismo eterno preface ercolani paolo storia infinita
marx il liberalismo e maledizione di nietzsche quotation quanto detto sin qui pu√≤ forse bastare non prendere sul serio saggi troppo fortunati ma gi√† quasi avviati al dimenticatoio come fine della storia del nippo-statunitense fukuyama
libro che comunque √® stato ampiamente stroncato per le sciocchezze che contiene e non gi√† da tardi epigoni del marxismo-leninismo ma da filosofi 'liberal' come dahrendorf il quale ha anche avuto il buon senso di elencare gli errori di fatto tali da mettere forse il conseguimento della maturit√† classica! che il troppo fortunato libretto contiene
