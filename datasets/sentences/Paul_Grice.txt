[citation needed] grice meaning grice's two most influential contributions study language communication theory meaning began develop article ‘meaning' written 1948 published 1957 prodding colleague p
grice further developed theory meaning fifth sixth william james lectures logic conversation delivered harvard 1967
these two lectures initially published ‘utterer's meaning intentions' 1969 ‘utterer's meaning sentence meaning word meaning' 1968 later collected other lectures first section studies way words 1989
natural vs
non-natural meaning grice begins ‘meaning' using techniques ordinary language philosophy distinguish calls natural meaning those spots mean meant measles
calls non-natural meaning john means he'll late ‘schnee' means ‘snow'
grice does attempt give definitions these two senses verb ‘to mean' nor does offer explicit theory distinguishes respective concepts they're used express
instead relies five differences ordinary language usage show use word least two different ways
intention-based semantics rest ‘meaning' discussions meaning ‘logic conversation' grice deals exclusively non-natural meaning
overall approach study non-natural meaning later came called intention-based semantics because attempts explain non-natural meaning terms notion speakers' intentions
grice distinguishes two kinds non-natural meaning utterer's meaning speaker means utterance
grice wouldn't introduce label until logic conversation
common label contemporary work speaker meaning although grice didn't use term
timeless meaning kind meaning possessed type utterance such word sentence
often called conventional meaning although grice didn't call
two steps intention-based semantics define utterer's meaning terms speakers' overt audience-directed intentions then 2 define timeless meaning terms utterer's meaning
net effect define linguistic notions meaning purely mental terms thus shed psychological light semantic realm
grice tries accomplish first step means following definition meant nn something x roughly equivalent uttered x intention inducing belief means recognition intention
definition ‘a' variable ranging over speakers ‘x' variable ranging over utterances
grice generalizes definition speaker meaning later ‘meaning' applies commands questions argues differ assertions speaker intends induce intention rather belief
grice's initial definition controversial seemingly gives rise variety counterexamples later adherents intention-based semantics—including grice himself stephen schiffer jonathan bennett dan sperber deirdre wilson stephen neale—have attempted improve various ways while keeping basic idea intact
grice next turns second step program explaining notion timeless meaning terms notion utterer's meaning
does very tentatively following definition x means nn timeless so-and-so might first shot equated statement disjunction statements people vague intend qualifications recognition effect x
basic idea here meaning word sentence results regularity speakers use word sentence mean
grice give much detailed theory timeless meaning sixth logic conversation lecture
influential attempt expand component intention-based semantics given stephen schiffer
grice's theory implicature grice's most influential contribution philosophy linguistics theory implicature first began developing 1961 article ‘the causal theory perception' most fully explored 1967 william james lectures logic conversation
saying/implicating distinction according grice speaker means utterance divided speaker says speaker thereby implicates
grice makes clear notion saying mind though related colloquial sense word somewhat technical referring favored notion ‘saying' must further elucidated
nonetheless grice never settled full elucidation definition favored notion saying interpretation notion become contentious issue philosophy language
point controversy surrounding grice's favored notion saying connection concept utterer's meaning
grice makes clear takes saying kind meaning sense doing former entails doing latter want say u utterer p entails 2 u something x u meant p 87
condition controversial grice argues apparent counterexamples—cases speaker apparently says something without meaning it—are actually examples calls making say thought kind mock saying play saying
another point controversy surrounding grice's notion saying relationship speaker says expression expression's timeless meaning
although attempts spell out connection detail several times most precise statement endorses following sense am using word say intend someone closely related conventional meaning words sentence uttered
unfortunately grice never spelled out meant phrase closely related passage philosophers language continue debate over best interpretation
‘the causal theory perception' grice contrasts saying there also calls stating implying logic conversation introduces technical term implicature cognates implicate implicatum
grice justifies neologism saying ‘implicature' blanket word avoid having make choices words like ‘imply' ‘suggest' ‘indicate' ‘mean'
grice sums up these notions suggesting implicate perform non-central speech act whereas say perform central speech act
others commonly put same distinction saying kind direct speech act whereas implicating indirect speech act
latter way drawing distinction important part john searle's influential theory speech acts
conventional vs
conversational implicature although grice best known theory conversational implicature also introduced notion conventional implicature
difference two lies fact speaker conventionally implicates uttering sentence tied way timeless meaning part sentence whereas speaker conversationally implicates directly connected timeless meaning
grice's best-known example conventional implicature involves word ‘but' argues differs meaning word ‘and' typically conventionally implicate something over above say former latter
uttering sentence ‘she poor she honest' example say merely she poor she honest implicate poverty contrasts honesty her poverty contrasts her honesty
grice makes clear speaker conventionally implicates uttering sentence part speaker means uttering also closely connected sentence means
nonetheless speaker conventionally implicates part speaker says
u's doing x might uttering sentence she poor she honest
u meant sentence means will both contain something contributed word want contribution appear account my favored sense u rather conventional implicature
grice elaborate much notion conventional implicature many other authors tried give extensive theories including lauri karttunen stanley peters kent bach stephen neale christopher potts
conversational implicature conversationally implicate something speaking according grice mean something goes beyond says such way must inferred non-linguistic features conversational situation together general principles communication cooperation
general principles grice proposed called cooperative principle maxims conversation
according grice cooperative principle norm governing cooperative interactions among humans
cooperative principle make your contribution such required stage occurs accepted purpose direction talk exchange you engaged
grice 1989
conversational maxims thought precisifications cooperative principle deal specifically communication
maxim quantity information make your contribution informative required current purposes exchange
make your contribution informative required
maxim quality truth say you believe false
say you lack adequate evidence
maxim relation relevance relevant
maxim manner clarity perspicuous avoid obscurity expression
avoid ambiguity
brief avoid unnecessary prolixity
grice follows summary maxims suggesting might need others goes say there course sorts other maxims aesthetic social moral character such polite also normally observed participants exchanges these may also generate nonconventional implicatures
conversational implicatures made possible according grice fact participants conversation assume each other behave according maxims
speaker appears violated maxim saying making say something false uninformative too informative irrelevant unclear assumption speaker fact obeying maxims causes interpreter infer hypothesis speaker really meant
interpreter will reliably allows speakers intentionally flout maxims—i
create appearance breaking maxims way obvious both speaker interpreter—in order get their implicatures across
perhaps grice's best-known example conversational implicature case reference letter quantity implicature
because involves flouting first maxim quantity writing testimonial pupil candidate philosophy job letter reads follows dear sir mr
x's command english excellent attendance tutorials regular
yours etc
gloss cannot opting out since wished uncooperative why write all? cannot unable through ignorance say since man pupil moreover knows information wanted
must therefore wishing impart information reluctant write down
supposition tenable thinks mr
x no good philosophy
then implicating
given speaker means given proposition p given utterance grice suggests several features p must possess order count conversational implicature
nondetachability implicature nondetachable insofar possible find another way saying same thing approximately same thing simply lacks implicature
putative conversational implicature explicitly cancelable form words utterance putatively implicates p admissible add p mean imply p contextually cancelable find situations utterance form words simply carry implicature
conversational implicata part meaning expressions employment attach
calculability presence conversational implicature must capable being worked out even fact intuitively grasped unless intuition replaceable argument implicature present will count conversational implicature will conventional implicature
generalized vs
particularlized conversational implicature grice also distinguishes generalized particularized conversational implicature
grice says particularized conversational implicatures such reference letter case quoted above arise cases implicature carried saying p particular occasion virtue special features context cases there no room idea implicature sort normally carried saying p
generalized implicature contrast arise cases say use certain form words utterance normally absence special circumstances carry such-and-such implicature type implicature
grice does offer full theory generalized conversational implicatures distinguishes them particularlized conversational implicatures hand conventional implicatures other hand later philosophers linguists attempted expand idea generalized conversational implicatures
grice's paradox book studies way words presents calls grice's paradox
supposes two chess players yog zog play 100 games under following conditions yog white nine ten times
2 there no draws
results yog white won 80 90 games
2 yog black won zero ten games
implies 8/9 times yog white yog won
ii 1/2 time yog lost yog black
iii 9/10 either yog wasn't white won
these statements might appear make these deductions contraposition conditional disjunction [a] [ii] yog white then 1/2 time yog won
[b] [iii] 9/10 times yog white then won
both untrue—they contradict
fact ii iii don't provide enough information use bayesian reasoning reach those conclusions
might clearer i-iii instead stated like yog white yog won 8/9 times
no information given yog black
ii yog lost yog black 1/2 time
no information given yog won
iii 9/10 times either yog black won yog black lost yog white won
no information provided how 9/10 divided among those three situations
grice's paradox shows exact meaning statements involving conditionals probabilities complicated may obvious casual examination
criticisms examinations relevance theory dan sperber deirdre wilson builds also challenges grice's theory meaning account pragmatic inference
