make-believe theory walton's major contribution philosophy theory representation known make-believe theory
context ontology same theory usually referred pretence theory context representational arts prop theory
walton working philosophical theory since 1973 expounded 1990 magnum opus mimesis make -believe foundations representational arts
theory development ernst gombrich's sketched ideas concerning relationship toys art presented famous essay 'meditations hobby horse' walton described having “largely ignored” most philosophy art
according walton's theory representational art understood props prescribe specific imaginings analogous way children's toys such dolls teddy bears function props children's games make-believe albeit greater sophistication
via certain principles generation any such prop generates fictional truths collectively constitute fictional worlds
walton identifies two kinds such worlds game world each participant work world thought containing such content true any well-formed game world
props divided two forms sensory depictions such paintings sculpture certain kinds music verbal representations such novels spoken component theater
key clarification make-believe theory offers idea term 'fictional' taken mean “true appropriate game make-believe” equivalently true fictional world representation

true believed fictional imagined
develops concept ontology fictional objects eliminates any “voodoo metaphysics” recognising people sometimes refer fictional entities referring real entities

walton refers these fictional emotions quasi emotions
later papers walton expanded theory recognize distinction content oriented make-believe describes participant's relationship fictional worlds novels films paintings etc
prop oriented make-believe participant's interest nature prop itself fictional world attaches
