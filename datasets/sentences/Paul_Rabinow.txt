concept work relation concepts cases rabinow’s work distinguishes itself common mode social science work predicated using examples test general theories philosophical practice seeks analytic clarity universals general often highly abstract cases
contrast rabinow argues work concepts opens up orients inquiry concrete features distinctive cases whereas use ostensibly timeless theory universal concepts unlikely very helpful drawing attention particularities singularities
given goal such traditional approaches function real impediment inquiry
rabinow defines concept work “constructing elaborating testing conceptual inventory well specifying experimenting multi-dimensional diagnostic analytic frames
sense rabinow’s work continues appropriate modifications social scientific tradition stretching max weber through clifford geertz
rabinow holds concepts tools designed used specified problems calibrated production pragmatic outcomes both analytic ethical
such concepts must adjusted changing topology problem spaces
concept work involves archaeological genealogical diagnostic dimensions
archaeologically concept work involves investigating characterizing concepts part prior repertoire structured conceptual ensemble
genealogically concept work frees concepts their field emergence showing contingent history their selection formation well their potential contemporary significance
diagnostically concept work involves critical function testing adequacy appropriateness given concept repertoire concepts new problems purposes
anthropology contemporary mode inquiry rabinow distinguishes anthropology contemporary michel foucault’s history present
rabinow describes history present consists formulating understanding past “a means showing contingency present thereby contribute making open future
current challenge specific inquiries objects best engaged approach drawn history present orientation
contrastingly rabinow defines contemporary reassemblage both old new elements their interactions interfaces
means among other things contemporary problems objects emergent consequently definition contingent
emergence refers “a state multiple elements combine produce assemblage whose significance cannot reduced prior elements relations
follows history present while often helpful fully adequate work contemporary because definition contemporary contingent
rabinow identifies “the contemporary” temporal ontological problem space
marking time 2007 distinguishes two senses term contemporary
first contemporary exist same time something else
meaning temporal no historical connotations
second sense however carries both temporal historical connotations meaning figures rabinow’s work
rabinow takes up contemporary “moving ratio
just “the modern” thought moving ratio tradition modernity contemporary “is moving ratio modernity moving through recent past near future non-linear space
such anthropology contemporary consists analytic work helps develop modes inquiry under-determined emergent discordant relations
seeks develop methods practices forms inquiry narration coherent co-operable understandings mode modes taken anthropos figure assemblage today
inquiry contemporary both analytic synthetic
analytic sets relations must decomposed specified synthetic these relations must recomposed given new form
sense work contemporary falls within zone analytic consideration consists linking recent past near future near future recent past
anthropos problem rabinow’s work anthropology contemporary formally initiated diagnosis anthropos greek “the human thing” problem today thought equipment venues
diagnosis carried out most systematically works anthropos today 2003 marking time 2007
rabinow describes anthropos being today burdened multiple heterogeneous truths itself being hetero-logoi
modes inquiry methods narration principles verification must designed view “apparently unavoidable fact anthropos being suffers too many logoi
follows order pose eventually answer question “what anthropos today?” modes thought needed open up new possibilities also discriminate significance forms truth claims practices ethical life
using classical formulation rabinow argues anthropos today need paraskeue equipment forming logos ethos
1981-82 lectures collège de france michel foucault provided extensive meditation classical notion equipment
those lectures foucault shows antique thought mandate “know thyself” connected oriented imperative “care thyself
ramifying foucault’s insight new directions rabinow posed challenge inventing equipment adequate ethical scientific problems today—contemporary equipment
challenge contemporary equipment develop mode thinking ethical practice also involves design redesign venues within such formation possible
rabinow deals directly problem venues work synthetic anthropos gaymon bennett 2009

collaboration defining feature venues rabinow called worked collaboration
understood mode work rabinow defines collaboration distinction cooperation
cooperative mode work consists “demarcated tasking distinct problems objects occasional regular exchange
cooperation does entail either common definition problems shared techniques remediation
collaborative mode work contrast proceeds interdependent division labor shared problems
entails common definition problems acceptance problem-space
rabinow calls invention new modes collaboration problem-spaces unstable emergent prior problems their significance no longer taken granted fruitfully contested
such situations require reworking existing modes reasoning intervention adjusting these modes topography emerging problem-space
