however outer framework epic remain virtually same every singing thus securing projection underlying themes such morality honour
performance epic poetry called classical greek rhapsōidia ῥαψῳδία performer rhapsōidos
word does occur early epics use word aoidos ἀοιδός singer performers genres including
unknown whether hesiod poets iliad odyssey recognised accepted name rhapsode argued walter burkert accepted recent scholars rhapsōidos definition performer fixed written text
word rhapsōidos use early pindar 522–443 bc implies two different explanations singer stitched verse singer staff
these first etymologically correct second suggested fact there early evidence singer accustomed hold staff ῥάβδος rhabdos hand perhaps like sceptre homeric assembly symbol right hearing emphasize rhythm give grandeur their gestures
etymological meaning interesting because exact metaphor oral narrative poets stitch together formulas lines type-scenes course performance
there indications pindar other authors oral epic still living popular tradition early fifth century later evidence however rhapsodes worked written texts cases compelled law
performance certain rhapsodes performed competitively contending prizes religious festivals practice already well-established fifth century bc
iliad alludes myth thamyris thracian singer boasted defeat even muses song
competed them defeated punished presumption loss ability sing
historically practice first evident hesiod's claim performed song funeral games amphidamas euboea won prize
competitive singing depicted vividly homeric hymn apollo mentioned two hymns aphrodite

description applies very well iliad argives alternate names greek warriors may suited thebaid still better since argos named first line poem
incident seems show poems performed rhapsodes political propagandistic importance peloponnese early sixth century bc
athens 33 p bc there law rhapsodes should perform homeric poems every panathenaic festival law appealed glory athens orator lycurgus
perhaps therefore such custom exceptional know whom introduced although platonic dialogue hipparchus really plato probably fourth century bc attributes hipparchus son peisistratos athens
hipparchus adds law required rhapsodists follow another order still
recurs different form much later statement diogenes laertius
57 solon made law poems should recited prompting
many athenian laws falsely attributed early lawgivers least clear fourth century homeric poems compulsory part panathenaea recited order
too long single rhapsode single day's performance
therefore divided parts each rhapsode take assigned part otherwise chosen favourite prize passages
complementary evidence oral performance poetry classical greece comes form references family clan professional association homeridae literally children homer
these certainly existence fifth fourth centuries bc certainly performed poems attributed homer
pindar seems count homeridae rhapsodes other sources specifically confirm categorisation
