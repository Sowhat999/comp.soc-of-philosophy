ethics title page principia ethica influential work principia ethica main inspirations movement against ethical naturalism see ethical non-naturalism partly responsible twentieth-century concern meta-ethics
naturalistic fallacy main article naturalistic fallacy moore asserted philosophical arguments suffer confusion use term particular argument definition term arguments
named confusion naturalistic fallacy
example ethical argument may claim thing certain properties then thing 'good
hedonist may argue 'pleasant' things 'good' things
other theorists may argue 'complex' things 'good' things
moore contends even such arguments correct provide definitions term 'good
property 'goodness' cannot defined
shown grasped
any attempt define x good property will simply shift problem why y-ness good first place?
open-question argument main article open-question argument moore's argument indefinability good thus fallaciousness naturalistic fallacy often called open-question argument presented §13 principia ethica
argument hinges nature statements such anything pleasant also good possibility asking questions such good x pleasant? according moore these questions open these statements significant will remain no matter substituted pleasure
moore concludes any analysis value bound fail
other words value analysed then such questions statements trivial obvious
since anything trivial obvious value must indefinable
critics moore's arguments sometimes claim appealing general puzzles concerning analysis cf
paradox analysis rather revealing anything special value
argument clearly depends assumption good definable analytic truth good assumption many contemporary moral realists like richard boyd peter railton reject
other responses appeal fregean distinction sense reference allowing value concepts special sui generis insisting value properties nothing natural properties strategy similar taken non-reductive materialists philosophy mind
good indefinable moore contended goodness cannot analysed terms any other property
principia ethica writes may true things good also something else just true things yellow produce certain kind vibration light
fact ethics aims discovering those other properties belonging things good
far too many philosophers thought named those other properties actually defining good these properties fact simply other absolutely entirely same goodness
§ 10 ¶ 3 therefore cannot define good explaining other words
point action thing say good
similarly cannot describe blind person exactly yellow
show sighted person piece yellow paper yellow scrap cloth say yellow
good non-natural property addition categorising good indefinable moore also emphasized non-natural property
means cannot empirically scientifically tested verified - within bounds natural science
moral knowledge moore argued once arguments based naturalistic fallacy discarded questions intrinsic goodness settled appeal following sidgwick called moral intuitions self-evident propositions recommend themselves moral reflection susceptible either direct proof disproof pe §
result view often described later writers advocate ethical intuitionism
moore however wished distinguish view views usually described intuitionist principia ethica written order express fact ethical propositions my first class [propositions good end itself] incapable proof disproof sometimes followed sidgwick's usage calling them 'intuitions
beg may noticed am 'intuitionist’ ordinary sense term
sidgwick himself seems never clearly aware immense importance difference distinguishes intuitionism common doctrine generally called name
intuitionist proper distinguished maintaining propositions my second class—propositions assert certain action right duty—are incapable proof disproof any enquiry results such actions
contrary am no less anxious maintain propositions kind 'intuitions’ maintain propositions my first class intuitions

moore principia ethica preface ¶ 5 moore distinguished view view deontological intuitionists held intuitions determine questions actions right required duty
moore consequentialist argued duties moral rules determined investigating effects particular actions kinds actions pe § 89 matters empirical investigation rather direct objects intuition pe § 90
moore's view intuitions revealed rightness wrongness specific actions things good themselves ends pursued
proof external world main article here hand most important parts moore's philosophical development break idealism dominated british philosophy represented works former teachers f
bradley john mc taggart defence regarded common sense form realism
1925 essay defence common sense argued against idealism scepticism toward external world grounds give reasons accept their metaphysical premises plausible reasons accept common sense claims our knowledge world sceptics idealists must deny
famously put point dramatic relief 1939 essay proof external world gave common sense argument against scepticism raising right hand saying here hand then raising left saying here another then concluding there least two external objects world therefore knows argument external world exists
surprisingly everyone inclined sceptical doubts found moore's method argument entirely convincing moore however defends argument grounds sceptical arguments seem invariably require appeal philosophical intuitions considerably less reason accept common sense claims supposedly refute
addition fueling moore's own work here hand argument also deeply influenced wittgenstein spent last years working out new approach moore's argument remarks published posthumously certainty
moore's paradox moore also remembered drawing attention peculiar inconsistency involved uttering sentence such raining believe raining
—a puzzle now commonly called moore's paradox
puzzle arises because seems impossible anyone consistently assert such sentence there doesn't seem any logical contradiction raining don't believe raining
because former statement weather latter statement person's belief weather perfectly logically possible may rain whilst person does believe raining
addition moore's own work paradox puzzle also inspired great deal work ludwig wittgenstein described paradox most impressive philosophical insight moore ever introduced
wittgenstein first heard paradox evening moore earlier stated lecture rushed round moore's lodgings got out bed insisted moore repeat entire lecture
organic wholes moore’s description principle organic unity extremely straightforward nonetheless principle seems generally escaped ethical philosophers ontologists before time value whole must assumed same sum values parts principia § 18
according moore moral actor cannot survey goodness inherent various parts situation assign value each them then generate sum order get idea total value
moral scenario complex assembly parts total value often created relations those parts their individual value
organic metaphor thus very appropriate biological organisms seem emergent properties cannot found anywhere their individual parts
example human brain seems exhibit capacity thought none neurons exhibit any such capacity
same way moral scenario value far greater sum component parts
understand application organic principle questions value perhaps best consider moore’s primary example consciousness experiencing beautiful object
see how principle works thinker engages reflective isolation act isolating given concept kind null-context determining intrinsic value
our example easily see per sui beautiful objects consciousnesses particularly valuable things
might value consider total value consciousness experiencing beautiful object seems exceed simple sum these values principia 182
