example pen falls off desk seems proof gravity exists because gravity made fall
gravity? 1500 gravity pen's desire go center earth 1700 gravity force acted distance according mathematical laws 1900 s gravity effect curved space-time today physicists theorize gravity may force carried subatomic particles called gravitons
gendlin views gravity concept points out concepts can't make anything fall
instead saying gravity causes things fall accurate say things falling cause [the different concepts of] gravity
interaction world prior concepts world
fact concepts change does mean arbitrary concepts formulated many diverse incompatible ways extent rooted experience each formulation own precise relationship experience
thus gendlin's philosophy goes beyond relativism postmodernism
agrees postmodernists culture language already implicit experiencing concepts
empirical testing crucial does keep science changing every few years
no assertions simply objective
gendlin points out universe everything implicitly intricate concepts because includes them concepts logical units generated wider conceptual process gendlin calls implicit intricacy
wider process logical way number characteristic regularities
gendlin shown possible refer directly process context given problem situation systematically generate new concepts precise logical units
because human beings ongoing interaction world breathe eat interact others every context any field work their bodies knowing conceptual implies further steps
thus possible drive car while carrying animated conversation possible einstein say feel theory years before formulate
human beings' ongoing interaction world provides ongoing validity
each move pumping blood discussing philosophy implies next step organic carrying forward
humans feel carrying forward both move itself feedback generates each moment possible feel how things moving implied next
specific training learn attend feeling deeply holistic felt sense whole situation form
felt sense quite different feeling sense emotions one's bodily awareness ongoing life process
because felt sense living interaction world relative way concepts
felt sense ordered concepts own properties different those logic example very precise intricate conceptualized variety non-arbitrary ways
much gendlin's philosophy concerned showing how implicit bodily knowing functions relation logic
example gendlin found felt sense allowed function relation concepts each carries other forward through steps deeper feel new formulation
gendlin underlines often does progress their understanding involves transitions existing conceptual models disrupted feel carrying forward insight occurring
feel because human logical conceptions dependent intricate order living-in-the-world
useful concepts derive relative sense logical intricate order other way round
gendlin's two major philosophical works experiencing creation meaning develops explicit ways approaching implicit process model demonstrates method developing body consistent concepts thinking organic processes implications thinking space time science genetics ethology consciousness language spirituality
