age ten sent local grammar school lycée charlemagne studied until eighteen
lycées being organically linked university france faculties since their napoleonic institution baccalauréat awarded juries made university professors cousin crowned ancient hall sorbonne latin oration owned first prize concours général competition best pupils lycées established under ancien régime reinstated under first empire still extant
classical training lycée strongly disposed literature éloquence then called
already known among fellow students knowledge greek
lycée graduated most prestigious higher education schools école normale supérieure now called pierre laromiguière then lecturing philosophy
second preface fragments philosophiques candidly states varied philosophical influences life cousin speaks grateful emotion excited memory day heard laromiguière first time
day decided my whole life
laromiguière taught philosophy john locke étienne bonnot de condillac happily modified points clearness grace appearance least removed difficulties charm spiritual bonhomie penetrated subdued
school remained ever since living heart french philosophy — henri bergson jean-paul sartre jacques derrida among past students
early influence cousin's philosophical thought cousin wanted lecture philosophy quickly obtained position master conferences maître de conférences school
second great philosophical impulse life teaching pierre paul royer-collard
teacher tells us severity logic gravity weight words turned me degrees without resistance beaten path condillac way since become easy then painful unfrequented scottish philosophy
scottish philosophy being common sense philosophy thomas reid others - taught both external world human mind introspection proving existence free will fact consciousness objective existence
1815–1816 cousin attained position suppliant assistant royer-collard history modern philosophy chair faculty letters
another thinker influenced early period maine de biran whom cousin regarded unequalled psychological observer time france
these men strongly influenced cousin's philosophical thought
laromiguière attributes lesson decomposing thought even though reduction sensation inadequate
royer-collard taught even sensation subject certain internal laws principles does itself explain superior analysis natural patrimony mind
de biran made special study phenomena will
taught distinguish cognitions especially simplest facts consciousness voluntary activity our personality truly revealed
through triple discipline cousin's philosophical thought first developed 1815 began public teaching philosophy normal school faculty letters
then took up study german worked immanuel kant friedrich heinrich jacobi sought master philosophy nature friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling first greatly attracted
influence schelling may observed very markedly earlier form philosophy
sympathized principle faith jacobi regarded arbitrary long recognized grounded reason
1817 went germany met hegel heidelberg
hegel's encyclopädie philosophischen wissenschaften appeared same year cousin earliest copies
thought hegel particularly amiable two became friends
following year cousin went munich met schelling first time spent month jacobi obtaining deeper insight philosophy nature
political troubles disrupt career france's political troubles interfered time career
events 1814–1815 took royalist side
adopted views party known doctrinaire royer-collard philosophical leader
seems gone further approached extreme left
then came reaction against liberalism 1821–1822 cousin deprived offices faculty letters normal school
normal school swept away cousin shared fate guizot ejected chair history
enforced abandonment public teaching mixed blessing set out germany view further philosophical study
while berlin 1824–1825 thrown prison either ill-defined political charge instance french police result indiscreet conversation
freed after six months remained under suspicion french government three years

three years followed period cousin's greatest triumph lecturer
return chair symbol triumph constitutional ideas greeted enthusiasm
hall sorbonne crowded hall no philosophical teacher paris since days pierre abélard
lecturer's eloquence mingled speculative exposition possessed singular power rhetorical climax
philosophy showed strikingly generalizing tendency french intellect logical need grouping details round central principles
there moral elevation cousin's spiritual philosophy touched hearts listeners seemed basis higher development national literature art even politics traditional philosophy france
lectures produced ardent disciples those any other contemporary professor philosophy
judged teaching influence cousin occupies foremost place rank professors philosophy like jacobi schelling dugald stewart united gifts speculative expository imaginative power

philosophy three distinctive points there three distinctive points cousin's philosophy
these method results method application method results history especially history philosophy
usual speak philosophy eclecticism
eclectic secondary subordinate sense
eclecticism self-condemned inoperative implies system doctrine basis fact criterion truth
otherwise cousin himself remarks simply blind useless syncretism
cousin saw proclaimed early period philosophical teaching necessity system base eclecticism
indeed advanced illustration confirmation truth system proof facts history correspond analysis consciousness
these three points method results philosophy history intimately connected
developments natural order sequence
become practice psychology ontology eclecticism history
cousin strongly insisted importance method philosophy
adopts ordinary observation analysis induction
observational method cousin regards 18 th century method descartes began abandoned locke condillac applied though imperfectly thomas reid kant used success
insists true method philosophy applied consciousness alone facts experience appear
proper condition application method shall through prejudice system omit single fact consciousness
authority consciousness good instance good
trusted trusted any
previous systems erred presenting facts consciousness
observational method observational method applied consciousness gives us science psychology
basis proper basis ontology metaphysics science being philosophy history
observation consciousness cousin adds induction complement method means inference reality necessitated data consciousness regulated certain laws found consciousness those reason
method observation induction thus explained philosophy will found marked off very clearly hand deductive construction notions absolute system represented either schelling hegel cousin regards based simply hypothesis abstraction illegitimately obtained other kant sense sir w
hamilton both view cousin limited psychology merely relative phenomenal knowledge issue scepticism far great realities ontology concerned
cousin finds psychologically individual consciousness finds also spontaneously expressed common sense universal experience humanity
fact function philosophy classify explain universal convictions beliefs common-sense philosophy nor instrument philosophy simply material philosophical method works harmony results must ultimately found
three results psychological observation three great results psychological observation sensibility activity liberty reason
these three facts different character found apart consciousness
sensations facts sensibility necessary
facts reason also necessary reason no less independent will sensibility
voluntary facts alone characters imputability personality
will alone person me
me centre intellectual sphere without consciousness impossible
find ourselves strange world two orders phenomena belong us apprehend condition our distinguishing ourselves them
further apprehend means light does come ourselves
light comes reason reason apprehends both itself sensibility envelops will obliges does constrain
consciousness then composed these three integrant inseparable elements
reason immediate ground knowledge consciousness itself
there peculiarity cousin's doctrine activity freedom doctrine reason enters deeply system
element spontaneity volition reason
heart new alike doctrine knowledge being
liberty freedom generic term means cause being endowed self-activity
itself own development own ultimate cause
free-will although preceded deliberation determination
reflection conscious even after determination free will will
there primary kind volition reflection condition yet free spontaneous
must willed thus spontaneously first otherwise know before our reflective volition will act
spontaneous volition free reflective prior act two
view liberty will accordance facts humanity excludes reflective volition explains enthusiasm poet artist act creation explains also ordinary actions mankind done rule spontaneously after reflective deliberation
doctrine reason doctrine reason distinctive principle philosophy cousin lies
reason given us psychological observation reason our consciousness impersonal nature
make character precisely opposite individuality universal necessary
recognition universal necessary principles knowledge essential point psychology ought put first emphasized last these exist wholly impersonal absolute
number these principles their enumeration classification important point secondary recognition their true nature
point kant missed analysis fundamental truth cousin thinks restored integrity philosophy method observation consciousness
how impersonality absoluteness conditions knowledge established ? answer substance kant went wrong putting necessity first criterion those laws
brought them within sphere reflection gave their guarantee impossibility thinking them reversed led their being regarded wholly relative human intelligence restricted sphere phenomenal incapable revealing us substantial reality—necessary yet subjective
test necessity wholly secondary these laws thus guaranteed us each given us given our consciousness act spontaneous apperception or' apprehension immediately instantaneously sphere above reflective consciousness yet within reach knowledge
subjectivity reflection expires spontaneity apperception
reason becomes subjective relation voluntary free self itself impersonal belongs self inhumanity belongs even humanity
may say truth nature humanity belong without laws both perish
number those laws? kant reviewing enterprise aristotle modern times given complete list laws thought arbitrary classification may legitimately reduced
according cousin there two primary laws thought causality substance
these flow naturally others
order nature substance first causality second
order acquisition our knowledge causality precedes substance rather both given us each other contemporaneous consciousness
these principles reason cause substance given thus psychologically enable us pass beyond limits relative subjective objective absolute reality enable us word pass psychology science knowledge ontology science being
these laws inextricably mixed consciousness data volition sensation free activity fatal action impression guide us rising personal being self free cause impersonal reality not-me—nature world force—lying out us modifying us
refer myself act attention volition cannot refer sensation cause necessarily other myself external cause whose existence certain me my own existence since phenomenon suggests me certain phenomenon suggested my reality both given each other
thus reach objective impersonal world forces corresponds variety my sensations
relation these forces causes each other order universe
these two forces me not-me reciprocally limitative
reason apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena attention sensation led us immediately conceive two sorts distinct absolute causes correlative reciprocally finite related notion limitation find impossible under same guide conceive supreme cause absolute infinite itself first last cause
relatively self not-self these their proper effects
cause self-sufficient sufficient reason
god must conceived under notion cause related humanity world
absolute substance insofar absolute cause philosophy essence lies precisely creative power
thus creates creates necessarily
theodicy cousin laid open obviously enough charge pantheism
repels answer may summed up follows
pantheism properly deification law phenomena universe god
distinguish two finite causes self not-self each other infinite cause
mere modifications cause properties spinoza--they free forces having their power spring action themselves sufficient our idea independent finite reality
hold hold relation these effects supreme cause
god plead neither deity pantheism nor absolute unity eleatics being divorced possibility creation plurality mere metaphysical abstraction
deity maintain creative necessarily creative
deity spinoza eleatics mere substance cause any sense
necessity under deity exists acting creating highest form liberty freedom spontaneity activity without deliberation
action result struggle passion virtue
free unlimited manner purest spontaneity man shadow freedom god
acts freely arbitrarily consciousness being able choose opposite part
cannot deliberate will
spontaneous action excludes once efforts miseries will mechanical operation necessity
elements found consciousness also found history humanity history philosophy
external nature there expansion contraction correspond spontaneity reflection
external nature again contrast humanity expresses spontaneity humanity expresses reflection
human history east represents spontaneous stage pagan christian world represent stages reflection
afterwards modified expanded fully expressed saying humanity universal development three principal moments
first spontaneous stage reflection yet developed art imperfect humanity thought immensity around
preoccupied infinite
secondly reflective stage mind become object itself
thus knows itself explicitly reflectively
own individuality now least supreme thing
moment finite
thirdly there comes epoch self me subordinated
mind realizes another power universe
finite infinite become two real correlatives relation cause product
third highest stage development relation finite infinite
philosophy highest expression humanity these three moments will represented history
east typifies infinite greece finite reflective epoch modern era stage relation correlation infinite finite
theology dominant philosophical idea each these epochs results pantheism polytheism theism
politics correspondence also ideas monarchy democracy constitutional polity
eclecticism thus means application psychological method history philosophy
confronting various systems co-ordinated sensualism idealism skepticism mysticism facts consciousness chasm result reached each system expresses order phenomena ideas truth very real alone consciousness same time holds almost exclusive place system whence follows each system false incomplete re-uniting incomplete systems should complete philosophy adequate totality consciousness
philosophy thus perfected mere aggregation systems ignorantly supposed integration truth each system after false incomplete discarded
comparison kant schelling hegel such system outline
historical position system lies relations kant schelling hegel
cousin opposed kant asserting unconditioned form infinite absolute cause mere unrealizable tentative effort part something different mere negation yet equivalent positive thought
cousin absolute ground being grasped positively intelligence renders else intelligible kant certain hypothetical regulative need
schelling again cousin agrees regarding supreme ground positively apprehended source development utterly repudiates schelling's method
intellectual intuition either falls under eye consciousness does
how you know object identical? does comes within sphere psychology objections thus relative made schelling himself dealt
schelling's intellectual intuition mere negation knowledge
again pure being hegel mere abstraction--a hypothesis illegitimately assumed nowhere sought vindicate
very point established possibility reaching being per se pure being yet hegelian system very thing assumed starting-point
besides course objections might made method development subverting principle contradiction galvanizing negation means advancing developing whole body human knowledge reality
intellectual intuition schelling above consciousness pure being hegel empty abstraction unvindicated illegitimately assumed arbitrarily'developed equally useless bases metaphysics
led cousin still holding essential knowledge being ground analysis consciousness--in psychology
absolute infinite absolute infinite—the unconditioned ground source reality—is yet apprehended us immediate datum reality apprehended consciousness—under condition wit distinguishing subject object knower known
doctrine cousin criticized sir w hamilton edinburgh review 1829 animadverted upon same time schelling
hamilton's objections follows
correlation ideas infinite finite does necessarily imply their correality cousin supposes contrary presumption finite simply positive infinite negative same—that finite infinite simply contradictory relatives
these positive alone real negative abstraction other highest generality even abstraction thought itself
study few sentences under head might obviated trifling criticism hamilton's objection set afloat recently denial knowledge absolute infinite implies foregone knowledge
how you deny reality you know? answer case contradictory statements—a a—the latter mere negation former posits nothing negation notion positive attributes finite does extend beyond abolishing given attributes object thought
infinite non-finite necessarily known ere finite negated order negate needs known finite itself contradictory negation implies no positive
non-organized may may correspond positive—i
object notion qualities contradictory organized mere sublation organized does posit suppose known beforehand anything exists corresponding
among many flaws hegelian dialectic paralyzes whole logic
secondly conditions intelligence cousin allows necessarily exclude possibility knowledge absolute—they held incompatible unity
here schelling hamilton argue cousin's absolute mere relative
thirdly objected order deduce conditioned cousin makes absolute relative makes absolute cause
cause existing absolutely under relation
such necessarily inferior sum total effects dependent reality these—in word mere potence becoming
further theory creation makes creation necessity destroys notion divine
cousin made no reply hamilton's criticism beyond alleging hamilton's doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge certainty psychology logic destroyed metaphysics introducing nescience uncertainty highest sphere—theodicy
attempt render laws reason thought impersonal professing find them sphere spontaneous apperception above reflective necessity unsuccessful
cause substance time space given us realized particular form
no single act affirmation cause substance much less such primitive act affirm universality their application
there may particular instances cases these laws never get laws themselves their universality far less absolute impersonality
no amount individual instances application any them us give true universality
sure test their universality our experience test their reflective necessity
thus after fall back reflection our ground their universal application mere spontaneity apprehension futile their universality grounded their necessity their necessity their universality
how far sense ground necessity renders them personal course questions still solved
these three correlative facts immediately given seems thought possible cousin vindicate them reflective consciousness
seeks trace steps reason spontaneously consciously irreflectively followed
here question arises—can vindicate reflective mediate process spontaneous apprehension reality? self self found cause force free action ground obliged relate volition consciousness self cause ultimate cause
clear analysis whether self immediately observed acting originating cause whether reflection working principle causality compelled infer existence character
self actually given need principle causality infer given causality never give us either notion fact self cause force far less ultimate
warrant cause sort reality cause
further principle causality fairly carried out universal necessary allow us stop personality will ultimate cause effect—volition
once applied facts drive us beyond first antecedent term antecedents volition still further cause ground—in fact land us infinite regress causes
same criticism even emphatically applicable influence not-self world forces corresponding our sensations cause them
starting sensation our basis causality never give us even though allowed sensation impersonal extent being independent our volition
causality might tell us cause there sensation somewhere sort cause force sum forces existing space independently us corresponding our sensations never tell us simple reason such notion supposed exist our consciousness
causality cannot add number our notions--cannot add number realities know
necessitate us think cause there given change cause cannot itself inform us even suggest us beyond implying must effect
sensation might arise aught know far causality leads us world forces will like our own though infinitely powerful acting upon us partly furthering partly thwarting us
indeed such supposition principle causality work within limits probability already supposed know such reality—a will—in our own consciousness
cousin thus set himself vindicate those points reflection gave up obvious advantage other position realities question given us immediate spontaneous apprehension
same criticism applies equally inference absolute cause two limited forces names self not-self
immediate spontaneous apperception may seize supreme reality vindicate reflection inference principle causality impossible
mere paralogism never infer either absolute infinite relative finite
truth cousin's doctrine spontaneous apperception impersonal truth amounts little presentment philosophical language ordinary convictions beliefs mankind
important preliminary stage philosophy properly begins attempts coordinate systematize those convictions harmony conciliate apparent contradiction opposition correlative notions finite infinite apparently conflicting notions personality infinitude self not-self word reconcile various sides consciousness each other
whether laws our reason laws intelligence being—whether how relate our fundamental intellectual moral conceptions beyond our experience infinite being—are problems cousin cannot regarded having solved
these truth outstanding problems modern philosophy
cousin's doctrine spontaneity volition hardly successful impersonality reason through volition spontaneous apperception
sudden unpremeditated volition may earliest most artistic best
volition essentially free choice alternatives best most deliberate because most rational
aristotle touched point distinction $oi~x~-ns srpoatpecric
sudden unpremeditated wish represented former wholly inferior character free choice latter guided illumined intelligence
deliberately resolve upon our power subject vain impulse wishing impossible
spontaneity pleasing sometimes beautiful instance highest quality thing obtained
found guiding illumining reflective activity
eclecticism open superficial objection proceeding without system test determining complete incomplete
open objection assuming particular analysis consciousness reached possible elements humanity history their combinations
may asked history individual consciousness? sense our analysis may give there ought once impose analysis any formula history
history likely reveal us first place true original elements combinations elements man study consciousness
besides tendency applying formula sort history assume elements developed certain regular necessary order whereas may case may find any epoch whole mixed either crossing co-operative consciousness individual himself
further question how these elements may possibly grown up general consciousness mankind assumed nonexistent impossible
tendency philosophy cousin outline things fill up details artistic imaginative interest
observational generalizing rather analytic discriminating
search principles profound power rigorous consecutive development limited
left no distinctive permanent principle philosophy left very interesting psychological analyses several new just true expositions philosophical systems especially locke philosophers scotland
same time man impressive power rare wide culture lofty aim--far above priestly conception philistine narrowness
familiar broad lines most systems philosophy
eclecticism proof reverential sympathy struggles human thought attain certainty highest problems speculation
doctrine comprehension toleration forming marked valuable contrast arrogance absolutism dogmatism sensationalism doctrine church authority preached theological school day
spirit saved youth france these other influences
educational reformer man learning greatly influenced others cousin stands out among memorable frenchmen 19 th century
