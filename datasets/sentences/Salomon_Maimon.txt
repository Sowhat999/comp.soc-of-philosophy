thought thing-in-itself seizes upon fundamental incompatibility consciousness apprehend yet separated thing-in-itself
object thought cannot outside consciousness just mathematics –1 unreal quantity things-in-themselves ex hypothesi outside consciousness
kantian paradox explains result attempt explain origin given consciousness
form things admittedly subjective mind endeavours explain material given same terms attempt impossible involves denial elementary laws thought
knowledge given therefore essentially incomplete
complete perfect knowledge confined domain pure thought logic mathematics
thus problem thing-in-itself dismissed inquiry philosophy limited sphere pure thought
application categories kantian categories demonstrable true their application given meaningless unthinkable
critical scepticism maimon takes up position intermediate kant hume
hume's attitude empirical entirely supported maimon
causal concept given experience expresses necessary objective order things ordered scheme perception subjective cannot postulated concrete law apart consciousness
doctrine differentials whereas kant posed dualism understanding sensibility concepts given maimon refers both these faculties back single source cognition
sensibility maimon's view therefore completely without conceptual content generated according rules maimon calls differentials
calling them maimon referring differentials calculus entities despite being neither qualitative nor quantitative nevertheless give rise determinate quantity quality related other differentials
operations faculty sensibility maimon therefore principally different those mathematical intuition seeing colour red same procedure drawing geometrical figure such line circle thought
reason qualities nevertheless 'given' infinite understanding grasp rules generation qualities way human understanding grasp rules drawing circle
kant's comments kant received first chapter maimon's book manuscript markus herz
letter herz may 1789 kant writes following half decided send manuscript back immediately
glance work made me realize excellence none my critics understood me main questions well herr maimon does also very few men possess much acumen such deep investigations
nevertheless kant does agree maimon's assessment
kant question relationship faculties adequately answered transcendental deduction kant argues categories make experience possible
furthermore explanation harmony faculties kant offers leibnizian account pre-established harmony
