ethology lorenz recognized founding fathers field ethology study animal behavior
best known discovery principle attachment imprinting through species bond formed new born animal caregiver
principle discovered douglas spalding 19 th century lorenz's mentor oskar heinroth also worked topic lorenz's description prägung imprinting nidifugous birds such greylag geese 1935 book kumpan umwelt des vogels companion environment birds became foundational description phenomenon
here lorenz used jakob von uexküll's concept umwelt understand how limited perception animals filtered out certain phenomena interacted instinctively
example young goose instinctively bonds first moving stimulus perceives whether mother person inanimate object
lorenz showed behavior imprinting allows goose learn recognize members own species enabling them object subsequent behavior patterns such mating
developed theory instinctive behavior saw behavior patterns largely innate triggered through environmental stimuli
argued animals inner drive carry out instinctive behaviors encounter right stimulus will eventually engage behavior inappropriate stimulus
lorenz's approach ethology derived skepticism towards studies animal behavior done laboratory settings
considered order understand mechanisms animal behavior necessary observe their full range behaviors their natural context
lorenz carry out much traditional fieldwork observed animals near home
method involved empathizing animals often using anthropomorphization imagine their mental states
believed animals capable experiencing many same emotions humans
tinbergen lorenz's friend whom conjointly received nobel prize summarized lorenz's major contribution ethology being way made behavior topic biological inquiry considering behavior part animal's evolutionary equipment
tinbergen lorenz contributed making ethology recognized sub-discipline within biology founded first specialized journal field ethology originally zeitschift für tierpsychologie politics lorenz joined nazi party 1938 accepted university chair under nazi regime
application party membership i'm able say my whole scientific work devoted ideas national socialists
publications during time led later years allegations scientific work contaminated nazi sympathies
published writing during nazi period included support nazi ideas racial hygiene couched pseudoscientific metaphors
autobiography lorenz frightened—as still am—by thought analogous genetical processes deterioration may work civilized humanity
moved fear very ill-advised thing soon after germans invaded austria dangers domestication order understood couched my writing worst nazi terminology
want extenuate action
indeed believe good might come new rulers
precedent narrow-minded catholic regime austria induced better intelligent men cherish naive hope
practically my friends teachers including my own father certainly kindly humane man
none us much suspected word selection used these rulers meant murder
regret those writings much undeniable discredit reflect my person their effect hampering future recognition dangers domestication
after war lorenz denied having party member until membership application made public denied having known extent genocide despite position psychologist office racial policy
also denied having ever held antisemitic views later shown used frequent antisemitic language series letters mentor heinroth
2015 university salzburg posthumously rescinded honorary doctorate awarded lorenz 1983 citing party membership assertions application national socialist work stands serve national socialist thought
university also accused using work spread basic elements racist ideology national socialism
during final years life lorenz supported fledgling austrian green party 1984 became figurehead konrad lorenz volksbegehren grass-roots movement formed prevent building power plant danube near hainburg donau thus destruction surrounding woodland
contributions legacy nikolaas tinbergen left 1978
lorenz called 'the father ethology' niko tinbergen
perhaps lorenz's most important contribution ethology idea behavior patterns studied anatomical organs
concept forms foundation ethological research
together nikolaas tinbergen lorenz developed idea innate releasing mechanism explain instinctive behaviors fixed action patterns
experimented supernormal stimuli such giant eggs dummy bird beaks found release fixed action patterns powerfully natural objects behaviors adapted
influenced ideas william mc dougall lorenz developed psychohydraulic model motivation behavior tended towards group selectionist ideas influential 1960 s
another contributions ethology work imprinting
influence younger generation ethologists popular works important bringing ethology attention general public
lorenz claimed there widespread contempt descriptive sciences
attributed denial perception source scientific knowledge denial evaluated status religion
comparative behavioral research necessary describe various patterns movement record them above render them unmistakably recognizable
there three konrad lorenz institutes austria housed family mansion altenberg another field station grünau
lorenz like other ethologists performed research largely observation experiments conducted conducted natural setting
animal welfare advocates like point out lorenz won nobel prize without ever using invasive techniques
lorenz's vision challenges facing humanity nikolaas tinbergen right konrad lorenz left 1978
lorenz also predicted relationship market economics threat ecological catastrophe
1973 book civilized man's eight deadly sins konrad lorenz addresses following paradox advantages man gained ever-deepening understanding natural world surrounds technological chemical medical progress should seem alleviate human suffering
tends instead favor humanity's destruction lorenz adopts ecological model attempt grasp mechanisms behind contradiction
thus species
adapted their environment
including inorganic components
other living beings inhabit locality
fundamental lorenz's theory ecology function feedback mechanisms especially negative ones hierarchical fashion dampen impulses occur beneath certain threshold
thresholds themselves product interaction contrasting mechanisms
thus pain pleasure act checks each other gain desired prey dog wolf will things other contexts shy away run through thorn bushes jump cold water expose themselves risks normally frighten them
these inhibitory mechanisms
act counterweight effects learning mechanisms
organism cannot allow itself pay price worth paying
nature these mechanisms tend towards 'stable state' among living beings ecology closer examination shows these beings
damage each other often constitute community interests
obvious predator strongly interested survival species animal vegetable constitutes prey
uncommon prey species derives specific benefits interaction predator species
lorenz states humanity species bound these mechanisms being defined own environment [the pace human ecology] determined progress man's technology p35
human ecology economy governed mechanisms positive feedback defined mechanism tends encourage behavior rather attenuate p43
positive feedback involves danger 'avalanche' effect
particular kind positive feedback occurs individuals same species enter competition among themselves
many animal species environmental factors keep
intraspecies selection [leading to] disaster
there no force exercises type healthy regulatory effect humanity's cultural development unfortunately itself humanity learned overcome those environmental forces external itself p44
lorenz does see human independence natural ecological processes necessarily bad
indeed states completely new [ecology] corresponds every way [humanity's] desires
theoretically prove durable existed without intervention 36
however principle competition typical western societies destroys any chance competition human beings destroys cold diabolic brutality
under pressure competitive fury forgotten useful humanity whole even good advantageous individual
asks damaging modern humanity thirst money consuming haste
either case fear plays very important role fear being overtaken one's competitors fear becoming poor fear making wrong decisions fear being up snuff
book lorenz proposes best hope mankind lies our looking mates based kindness their hearts rather good looks wealth
illustrates jewish story explicitly described such
lorenz early scientists recognised significance overpopulation
number deadly sin civilized man book overpopulation leads aggression
philosophical speculations 1973 book behind mirror search natural history human knowledge lorenz considers old philosophical question whether our senses correctly inform us world provide us illusion
answer comes evolutionary biology
traits help us survive reproduce transmitted
our senses gave us wrong information our environment soon extinct
therefore sure our senses give us correct information otherwise here deceived
