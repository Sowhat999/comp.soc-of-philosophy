university college rhodesia nyasaland before moving new college oxford rhodes scholar 1963
mc dowell's earliest published work ancient philosophy most notably including translation commentary plato's theaetetus
1970 s active davidsonian project providing semantic theory natural language co-editing gareth evans volume essays entitled truth meaning
mc dowell edited published evans's influential posthumous book varieties reference 1982
early work mc dowell very much involved both development davidsonian semantic programme internecine dispute those take core theory play role theory meaning involve grasp truth conditions those such michael dummett argued linguistic understanding must core involve grasp assertion conditions
dummett argued core theory going duty theory meaning supposed represent speaker's understanding then understanding must something speaker manifest grasp
mc dowell argued against dummettian view development such contemporaries crispin wright both claim dummett supposed represent wittgensteinian requirement theory meaning rested suspect asymmetry evidence expressions mind speech others thoughts expressed
particular argument reflects mc dowell's wider commitment idea understand others inside our own practices wright dummett treated pushing claims explanation too far continuing willard van orman quine's project understanding linguistic behaviour external perspective
these early exchanges parallel debate over proper understanding wittgenstein's remarks rule-following mc dowell's characteristic intellectual stances formed borrow wittgensteinian expression defence realism without empiricism emphasis human limits our aspiration objectivity idea meaning mind directly manifested action particularly linguistic action other people distinctive disjunctive theory perceptual experience
latter account perceptual experience developed service mc dowell's realism denied argument illusion supports indirect representative theory perception argument presupposes there highest common factor shared veridical illusory accurately delusive experiences
there clearly distinction perceiving acquiring belief see apparently bent stick water believe bent knows one's experience illusory
illusions you need believe things illusory experiences represent them being delusions person believes their experience represents them
argument illusion better described argument delusion make central point
classic argument illusion delusion you asked compare case you succeed perceiving say cat mat case trick light deceives you form belief cat mat
proponent argument then says two states mind these contrasting cases share something important common characterise need introduce idea like sense data
acquaintance such data highest common factor across two cases
seems force us concession our knowledge external world indirect mediated via such sense data
mc dowell strongly resists argument does deny there something psychologically common subject really sees cat fails
psychological commonality no bearing status judger's state mind point view assessing whether she position acquire knowledge
favourable conditions experience such make manifest presence objects observers perceptual knowledge
succeed knowing something perceiving experience does fall short fact known
just shows successful failed perceptual thought nothing interesting common point view appraising them knowledge
claim veridical perception non-veridical perception share no highest common factor theme visible runs throughout mc dowell's work namely commitment seeing thoughts essentially individuable their social physical environment called externalism mental
mc dowell defends addition general externalism mental specific thesis understanding demonstrative expressions involving so-called singular russellian thoughts particular objects reflects influence views gareth evans
according view putative object picked out demonstrative does exist then such object dependent thought cannot exist most literal sense available thought
value theory parallel development work mind language mc dowell also made significant contributions moral philosophy specifically meta-ethical debates over nature moral reasons moral objectivity
mc dowell developed view come known secondary property realism sensibility moral sense theory
theory proceeds via device ideally virtuous agent such agent two connected capacities
she right concepts correct grasp concepts think situations she finds herself coming moral beliefs
secondly such person such moral beliefs automatically over-riding over other reasons she may particular way silence other reasons mc dowell puts
believes best way capture traditional idea moral reasons specially authoritative
mc dowell also here departs standard interpretation humean theory how action motivated
humean claims any intentional action hence any moral action motivated combination two mental states belief desire
belief functions passive representation desire functions supply distinctively motivational part combination
basis account virtuous moral agent mc dowell follows thomas nagel rejecting account inaccurate truthful say case moral action virtuous agent's perception circumstances her belief itself justifies both action desire
example cannot understand desire humean original existence without relating back circumstances impinged agent made her feel compelled act
while humean thesis may truth explanation true structure justification ought replaced nagel's motivated desire theory set out possibility altruism oxford university press 1970
implicit account theory metaphysical status values moral agents form beliefs moral facts straightforwardly true false
however facts themselves like facts colour experience combine anthropocentricity realism
values there world any observer example without our human interest morality
however sense colours world either cannot deny colours both present our experience needed good explanations our common sense understanding world
test reality property whether used judgements there developed standards rational argument whether needed explain aspects our experience otherwise inexplicable
mc dowell thinks moral properties pass both these tests
there established standards rational argument moral properties fall general class those properties both anthropocentric real
connection mc dowell's general metaphysics particular claim moral properties claims objectivity made internal perspective our actual practices part view takes later wittgenstein
there no standpoint outside our best theories thought language classify secondary properties second grade less real properties described example mature science such physics
characterising place values our worldview mc dowell's view downgrade them less real talk quarks higgs boson
mind world 1994 later development mc dowell's work came strongly reflect influence rorty sellars particular both mind world mc dowell's later woodbridge lectures focus broadly kantian understanding intentionality mind's capacity represent
mind world sets itself task understanding sense active even our perceptual experience world
influenced sellars's famous diagnosis myth given traditional empiricism sellars argued blankly causal impingement external world judgement failed supply justification something belief-like conceptual structure engage rational justification mc dowell tries explain how accept passive our perceptual experience world while active how conceptualise
mc dowell develops account kant called spontaneity our judgement perceptual experience while trying avoid suggestion resulting account any connection idealism
mind world rejects course argument position mc dowell takes working ideology most philosophical contemporaries namely reductively naturalistic account mc dowell labels bald naturalism
contrasts view deems own naturalistic perspective distinctive capacities mind cultural achievement our second nature idea adapts gadamer
book concludes critique quine's narrow conception empirical experience also critique donald davidson's views belief inherently veridical davidson plays role pure coherentist
hallmarks mc dowell's later work denial there any philosophical use idea our experience contains representations conceptually structured so-called non-conceptual content
given other philosophers claim scientific accounts our mental lives particularly cognitive sciences need idea claim mc dowell's provoked great deal discussion
mc dowell develops stringent reading sellars' diagnosis myth given perceptual experience argue need separate out exercise concepts experience causal account pre-conditions experience idea non-conceptual content straddles boundary philosophically unacceptable way
while mind world represents important contemporary development kantian approach philosophy mind metaphysics two uncharitable interpretations kant's work book receive important revisions mc dowell's later woodbridge lectures published journal philosophy vol
