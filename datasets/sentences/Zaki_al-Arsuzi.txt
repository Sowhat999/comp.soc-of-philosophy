arab ba'ath 1940–1947 around same time al-arsuzi founded arab ba'ath another group led michel aflaq salah al-din al-bitar established arab ihya movement
patrick seale states al-arsuzi issued pamphlets under name al-ba'ath al-'arabi while arab ilhya movement published pamphlets under name al-ihya al-'arabi

there many members party most them used their time reading writing translating works
june 1941 al-arsuzi exiled damascus three members arrested remaining members fled
following year 1942 al-arsuzi associates tried revitalise party attempt failed
associates claims al-arsuzi become bitter even paranoid during one-year exile exclaiming group loved people hated individual [his group] held whole sacred despised parts
1944 majority arab ba'ath members left organisation active arab ihya movement renamed arab ba'ath movement 1943
relations aflaq al-arsuzi bitter best al-arsuzi accused aflaq stealing party's name
same time al-arsuzi's interest politics waning spent increasing amount time engaging philology

according associates al-arsuzi himself spent great deal time living extreme poverty reduced life penury persecution french authorities
al-arsuzi's popularity within own ranks lessened after rashid ali al-gaylani's coup iraq
while aflaq al-bitar founded syrian committee help iraq support iraq during anglo–iraqi war al-arsuzi opposed any involvement grounds al-gaylani's policies fail
while several arab ba'ath members agreed al-arsuzi's conclusion majority attracted aflaq's romanticism
another reason arab ba'ath's failure al-arsuzi's deep mistrust others party member written manifesto entitled arab ba'ath al-arsuzi saw imperialist plot block way people
al-arsuzi seen early 1960 s arab ba'ath movement led aflaq al-bitar merged arab ba'ath party 1947
during negotiations wahib al-ghanim jalal al-sayyid al-arsuzi represented arab ba'ath while aflaq al-bitar represented arab ba'ath movement

al-arsuzi elected seat national command ba'ath party 1965
salah jadid ba'ath party strongman time opposed aflaq's al-bitar's leadership party because wanted al-arsuzi replace them original founder ba'athist thought
following ba'ath party split 1966 party split two branches iraqi-led ba'ath party syrian-led ba'ath party al-arsuzi became syrian-led ba'ath party's main ideologue while aflaq de jure ideologue iraqi-led ba'ath party

al-arsuzi believed arabs lost their common identity allowed non–arabs participate government
result several laws non-arab characteristics—these laws other changes brought non-arabs weakened arab identity

described proponent linguistic image arab nationalism 1942 published most important works abqariyyat al-'arabiyya fi lisaniha genius arabic tongue
approach distinguished emphasis philology also pay attention problems modern state questions democracy locus power
batatu also described al-arsuzi having racist outlook proved end intellectually sterile unsatisfactory followers having deeply influenced thought tenets alawi religious background
al-arsuzi argued unlike latin language conventional uses arbitrary signs explain certain objects arabic language formed words derived vocalism syllables expression direct representation natural object unlike latin arabic essentially conformity nature
arabic according al-arsuzi intuitive language there natural sympathy pronunciation arabic words their meaning arabic word united meaning definition referent absorbed such operation
al-arsuzi identity arab nation embodied arab language language forms source nationalist spirit
according al-arsuzi's theory european nationalism based principle causality while arab nationalism based principle spontaneity
al-arsuzi's definition language contrast socrates other thinkers
nationalism al-arsuzi attributed rise european nationalism revolutions intellectual social economic domains
first revolution came being under feudal system gave birth human casual[clarification needed] relative relationships
second revolution scientific revolution led nicolaus copernicus galileo galilei ended conception nature developed during medieval ages
these events created foundations modern rationality
subject al-arsuzi man qualified know truth since constructed reason verified experiment
al-arsuzi summed up particular view human behaviour civilization rené descartes's words common sense reason naturally equal man
al-arsuzi's view humans rational creatures each wish organise themselves according her own sense reason hence want take over affairs state oppressors colonists
colonists acted barrier such rational change
modern life existed because two things—science industry
science eliminated superstition replaced facts industry enabled civilization create strong organised society liberty equality democracy become permanent
experiences english french revolutions proved revolutions gave individual certain rights individual conduct own affairs according will
demand liberty eventually evolve demand independence literally nationalism
nationalism according al-arsuzi manifested itself walks life rule law arts everything nation manifestation particular nation's identity
al-arsuzi's thesis marked dividing line medieval ages modern age
legacy al-arsuzi's work thought almost unknown barely mentioned western scholarship arab nationalism
actually mentioned text predominantly irredentist views unified arab nation
although collected works published since mid-1970 s al-arsuzi's work arabic language central al-arsuzi's nationalist thought rarely mentioned
study al-arsuzi's ideas arabic scholarship also lacking
academic yasir suleiman gives principal reason similarity al-arsuzi's works those sati' al-husri contemporary
suleiman goes explain al-arsuzi's eclipsed legacy combination number factors firstly contrast al-husri's idea language al-arsuzi's theory self-defeating because excluded other theories instead including them
secondly work written elitist slant rather populist al-husri managed convey
thirdly contrast al-husri's work al-arsuzi's work seemed old-fashioned due use old words historical texts moreover while al-arsuzi symbolic need arab nation al-hustri practical role arab nation—al-arsuzi obscure al-husri transparent
whereas al-husri able prove arguments empirical data al-arsuzi unable
thus suleiman writes al-husri appeared informed then al-arsuzi really
lack empirical data al-arsuzi's work made look parochial times while other times conclusions bordered machoistic nationalism turn interpreted racism
another reason negligible impact according suleiman al-arsuzi's idea need replace traditional arabic grammar system new
center research documentation world language problems agrees suleiman's conclusion further claims al-arsuzi's work often far-fetched 'airy-fairy'
several ba'athists mostly syrian-led ba'ath party denounced aflaq thief these critics claim aflaq stolen ba'athist ideology al-arsuzi proclaimed own
whatever case may al-arsuzi hailed hafiz al-assad ba'athist leader syria principal founder ba'athist thought following 1966 ba'ath party split
iraqi branch however still proclaims aflaq founder ba'athism
al-assad referred al-arsuzi greatest syrian day claimed first conceive ba'ath political movement
syrian ba'athists erected statue al-arsuzi's honour erected following 1966 coup
even majority ba'athists still agree aflaq al-arsuzi principal founder ba'ath movement
however keith david watenpaugh states ideology developed trio consisting al-arsuzi aflaq salah al-din al-bitar there principal founder
