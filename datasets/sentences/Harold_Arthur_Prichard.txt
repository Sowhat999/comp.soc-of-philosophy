mistake argued both because impossible derive any statement ought statements concerning obligation even statements good because there no need since common sense principles moral obligation self-evident
essay laid groundwork ethical intuitionism provided inspiration most influential moral philosophers such john rawls
criticism utilitarianism prichard attacks utilitarianism being capable forming obligation
states cannot justify obligation pointing consequences obligated action because pointing consequences shows action desirable advisable obligatory
other words claims while utilitarianism may encourage people actions moral person cannot create moral obligation those actions
deriving moral obligation h
prichard ethical intuitionist meaning believed through our moral intuitions come know right wrong
further while believes moral obligations justified reasons does believe reasons external obligation itself
instance person asked why ought torture chipmunks satisfying answer given ought torture chipmunks
prichard along other intuitionists adopts foundationalist approach morality
foundationalism theory epistemology states there certain fundamental principles basis other knowledge
case ethics foundationalists hold certain fundamental moral rules their own justification
walter sinnott-armstrong explains deepest challenge moral epistemology general epistemology raised skeptical regress argument someone justified believing something believer reason expressible inference premises believer already justified believing
requires chain inferences must continue infinitely close circle stop arbitrarily
academic skeptics reject three options conclude there no way anyone justified believing anything
same regress arises moral beliefs
simplest way stop regress simply stop
believer work back premise believer justified believing without being able infer premise anything else then there no new premise justify regress goes no further
how foundationalists stop regress general epistemology
moral intuitionists apply foundationalism moral beliefs way stop skeptical regress regarding moral beliefs
therefore prichard concludes just observation other people necessitates other people exist observation moral obligation necessitates obligation exists
prichard finishes essay answering few obvious problems
most notably explains how people should guarantee accuracy their moral intuitions
clearly observations misleading
instance someone sees pencil water may conclude object water bent
however pulls pencil water sees straight
same occur moral intuition
begins doubt one's intuition should try imagine oneself moral dilemma related decision
intuition persists then intuition accurate
prichard further supports these claims pointing out how illegitimate doubt previously believed moral intuitions these considerations mind consider parallel seems me presented though certain differences moral philosophy
sense ought certain things arises our unreflective consciousness being activity moral thinking occasioned various situations find ourselves
stage our attitude these obligations unquestioning confidence
inevitably appreciation degree execution these obligations contrary our interest raises doubt whether after these obligations really obligatory
whether our sense ought certain things illusion
then want proved us ought
convinced process argument different kind our original unreflective appreciation
demand argued illegitimate
hence first place almost universally case moral philosophy meant knowledge satisfy demand there no such knowledge attempts attain doomed failure because rest mistake mistake supposing possibility proving apprehended directly act moral thinking
