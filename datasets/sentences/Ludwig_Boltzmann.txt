father ludwig georg boltzmann revenue official
grandfather moved vienna berlin clock manufacturer boltzmann's mother katharina pauernfeind originally salzburg
received primary education private tutor home parents
boltzmann attended high school linz upper austria
boltzmann 15 father died
boltzmann studied physics university vienna starting 1863
among teachers josef loschmidt joseph stefan andreas von ettingshausen jozef petzval
boltzmann received ph degree 1866 working under supervision stefan dissertation kinetic theory gases
1867 became privatdozent lecturer
after obtaining doctorate degree boltzmann worked two years stefan's assistant
stefan introduced boltzmann maxwell's work
academic career 1869 age 25 thanks letter recommendation written stefan appointed full professor mathematical physics university graz province styria
1869 spent several months heidelberg working robert bunsen leo königsberger then 1871 gustav kirchhoff hermann von helmholtz berlin
1873 boltzmann joined university vienna professor mathematics there stayed until 1876
ludwig boltzmann co-workers graz 1887
standing left nernst streintz arrhenius hiecke sitting left aulinger ettingshausen boltzmann klemenčič hausmanninger 1872 long before women admitted austrian universities met henriette von aigentler aspiring teacher mathematics physics graz
she refused permission audit lectures unofficially
boltzmann advised her appeal she successfully
july 17 1876 ludwig boltzmann married henriette three daughters two sons
boltzmann went back graz take up chair experimental physics
among students graz svante arrhenius walther nernst
spent 14 happy years graz there developed statistical concept nature
boltzmann appointed chair theoretical physics university munich bavaria germany 1890
1893 boltzmann succeeded teacher joseph stefan professor theoretical physics university vienna
final years boltzmann spent great deal effort final years defending theories
get along colleagues vienna particularly ernst mach became professor philosophy history sciences 1895
same year georg helm wilhelm ostwald presented their position energetics meeting lübeck
saw energy matter chief component universe
boltzmann's position carried day among other physicists supported atomic theories debate
1900 boltzmann went university leipzig invitation wilhelm ostwald
after retirement mach due bad health boltzmann returned vienna 1902
1903 founded austrian mathematical society together gustav von escherich emil müller
students included karl przibram paul ehrenfest lise meitner
vienna boltzmann taught physics also lectured philosophy
boltzmann's lectures natural philosophy very popular received considerable attention
first lecture enormous success
even though largest lecture hall chosen people stood way down staircase
because great successes boltzmann's philosophical lectures emperor invited reception palace
boltzmann subject rapid alternation depressed moods elevated expansive irritable moods likely symptoms undiagnosed bipolar disorder
himself jestingly attributed rapid swings temperament fact born during night shrove tuesday ash wednesday
meitner relates those close boltzmann aware bouts severe depression suicide attempts
september 5 1906 while summer vacation duino near trieste boltzmann hanged himself during attack depression
buried viennese zentralfriedhof tombstone bears inscription entropy formula philosophy boltzmann's kinetic theory gases seemed presuppose reality atoms molecules almost german philosophers many scientists like ernst mach physical chemist wilhelm ostwald disbelieved their existence
during 1890 s boltzmann attempted formulate compromise position allow both atomists anti-atomists physics without arguing over atoms
solution use hertz's theory atoms bilder models pictures
atomists think pictures real atoms while anti-atomists think pictures representing useful unreal model fully satisfy either group
furthermore ostwald many defenders pure thermodynamics trying hard refute kinetic theory gases statistical mechanics because boltzmann's assumptions atoms molecules especially statistical interpretation second law thermodynamics
around turn century boltzmann's science being threatened another philosophical objection
physicists including mach's student gustav jaumann interpreted hertz mean electromagnetic behavior continuous there no atoms molecules likewise physical behavior ultimately electromagnetic
movement around 1900 deeply depressed boltzmann since mean end kinetic theory statistical interpretation second law thermodynamics
after mach's resignation vienna 1901 boltzmann returned there decided become philosopher himself refute philosophical objections physics soon became discouraged again
1904 physics conference st
louis most physicists seemed reject atoms even invited physics section
rather stuck section called applied mathematics violently attacked philosophy especially allegedly darwinian grounds actually terms lamarck's theory inheritance acquired characteristics people inherited bad philosophy past hard scientists overcome such inheritance
1905 boltzmann corresponded extensively austro-german philosopher franz brentano hope gaining better mastery philosophy apparently better refute relevancy science became discouraged approach well
following year 1906 mental condition became bad resign position
committed suicide september same year hanging himself while vacation wife daughter near trieste italy
physics boltzmann's most important scientific contributions kinetic theory including maxwell–boltzmann distribution molecular speeds gas
addition maxwell–boltzmann statistics boltzmann distribution over energies remain foundations classical statistical mechanics
applicable many phenomena require quantum statistics provide remarkable insight meaning temperature
boltzmann's 1898 i2 molecule diagram showing atomic sensitive region α β overlap
much physics establishment share belief reality atoms molecules — belief shared however maxwell scotland gibbs united states most chemists since discoveries john dalton 1808
long-running dispute editor preeminent german physics journal day refused let boltzmann refer atoms molecules anything other convenient theoretical constructs
couple years after boltzmann's death perrin's studies colloidal suspensions 1908–1909 based einstein's theoretical studies 1905 confirmed values avogadro's number boltzmann's constant convinced world tiny particles really exist

boltzmann kinetic theory gases
famous formula entropy s k boltzmann's constant ln natural logarithm
w wahrscheinlichkeit german word meaning probability occurrence macrostate precisely number possible microstates corresponding macroscopic state system — number unobservable ways observable thermodynamic state system realized assigning different positions momenta various molecules
boltzmann's paradigm ideal gas n identical particles ni ith microscopic condition range position momentum
w counted using formula permutations ranges over possible molecular conditions
denotes factorial
correction denominator because identical particles same condition indistinguishable
boltzmann also founders quantum mechanics due suggestion 1877 energy levels physical system discrete
equation s engraved boltzmann's tombstone vienna zentralfriedhof — second grave
boltzmann equation boltzmann's bust courtyard arcade main building university vienna
main article boltzmann equation boltzmann equation developed describe dynamics ideal gas
ƒ represents distribution function single-particle position momentum given time see maxwell–boltzmann distribution f force m mass particle t time v average velocity particles
equation describes temporal spatial variation probability distribution position momentum density distribution cloud points single-particle phase space
see hamiltonian mechanics
first term left-hand side represents explicit time variation distribution function while second term gives spatial variation third term describes effect any force acting particles
right-hand side equation represents effect collisions
boltzmann's grave zentralfriedhof vienna bust entropy formula
principle above equation completely describes dynamics ensemble gas particles given appropriate boundary conditions
first-order differential equation deceptively simple appearance since ƒ represent arbitrary single-particle distribution function
also force acting particles depends directly velocity distribution function ƒ
boltzmann equation notoriously difficult integrate
david hilbert spent years trying solve without any real success
form collision term assumed boltzmann approximate
however ideal gas standard chapman–enskog solution boltzmann equation highly accurate
expected lead incorrect results ideal gas under shock wave conditions
boltzmann tried many years prove second law thermodynamics using gas-dynamical equation — famous h-theorem
however key assumption made formulating collision term molecular chaos assumption breaks time-reversal symmetry necessary anything imply second law
probabilistic assumption alone boltzmann's apparent success emanated long dispute loschmidt others over loschmidt's paradox ultimately ended failure

dorfman proved systematic power series extension boltzmann equation high densities mathematically impossible
consequently nonequilibrium statistical mechanics dense gases liquids focuses green–kubo relations fluctuation theorem other approaches instead
second law law disorder idea second law thermodynamics entropy law law disorder dynamically ordered states infinitely improbable due boltzmann's view second law
particular attempt reduce stochastic collision function law probability following random collisions mechanical particles
following maxwell boltzmann modeled gas molecules colliding billiard balls box noting each collision nonequilibrium velocity distributions groups molecules moving same speed same direction become increasingly disordered leading final state macroscopic uniformity maximum microscopic disorder state maximum entropy macroscopic uniformity corresponds obliteration field potentials gradients
second law argued thus simply result fact world mechanically colliding particles disordered states most probable
because there many possible disordered states ordered ones system will almost found either state maximum disorder macrostate greatest number accessible microstates such gas box equilibrium moving towards
dynamically ordered state molecules moving same speed same direction boltzmann concluded thus most improbable case conceivable
infinitely improbable configuration energy
boltzmann accomplished feat showing second law thermodynamics statistical fact
gradual disordering energy analogous disordering initially ordered pack cards under repeated shuffling just cards will finally return their original order shuffled gigantic number times entire universe must day regain pure chance state first set out
optimistic coda idea dying universe becomes somewhat muted attempts estimate timeline will probably elapse before spontaneously occurs
tendency entropy increase seems cause difficulty beginners thermodynamics easy understand standpoint theory probability
consider two ordinary dice both sixes face up
after dice shaken chance finding these two sixes face up small 36 thus say random motion agitation dice like chaotic collisions molecules because thermal energy causes less probable state change probable
millions dice like millions atoms involved thermodynamic calculations probability their being sixes becomes vanishingly small system must move probable states
however mathematically odds dice results being pair sixes also hard ones them being sixes since statistically data tend balance every 36 pairs dice will tend pair sixes
cards shuffled will sometimes present certain temporary sequence order even whole disordered
