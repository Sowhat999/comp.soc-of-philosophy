263–339 book titled against hierocles contra hieroclem time early 4 th century
date disputed
adolf von harnack writing early 20 th century argued should dated before 303 since does contain any reference persecution began year
strengthened argument makes later date unlikely
ernst schwartz however writing same time believed against hierocles contained reference death galerius happened april may 311
schwartz consequently dated work event death maximinus summer 313
stevenson studies eusebius 1929 argued date 306/07 grounds eusebius appears refer hierocles prefect egypt
dating proved less popular literature dates harnack schwartz
most mid-20 th century scholars followed schwartz
1976 barnes restatement expansion harnack's arguments contested schwartz' dating
barnes found 311–13 dating difficult countenance given else known eusebius' literary history period—namely preparation gospel fifteen books demonstration gospel twenty soon after 313
expansive literary project also barnes argued project far removed tone substance against hierocles
moreover seems betray advance eusebius' knowledge whereas hierocles eusebius states hierocles' comparison jesus apollonius tyana sole act originality writers ever attacked us [he] stands alone selecting apollonius recently done purposes comparison contrast our saviour p
9–12 preparation eusebius makes extensive reference porphyry tyre's against christians used same trope
eusebius also known written work titled against porphyry twenty-five books does survive must fit somewhere timeline
barnes disputes validity schwartz's claim eusebius refers death galerius
