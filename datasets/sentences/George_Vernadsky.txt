interpretation russian history vernadsky took novel approach russian history presenting continuous succession empires starting scythian sarmatian hunnic gothic vernadsky attempted determine laws their expansion collapse
views emphasized importance eurasian nomadic cultures cultural economic progress russia thus anticipating ideas advanced lev gumilev
vernadsky became leading american exponent depicting russia much asian european
pointed out many strong cultural differences russia europe praised success russian development along independent path revealed own unique character
vernadsky geographical determinist like yale colleague ellsworth huntington
assumed characteristics land defined character people indeed their government well
reason vernadsky able identify roots russian culture ancient period long before slavic groups arrived
thereby undercut standard claim modern russia emerged kievan rus
emphasized importance mongol period 1238-1471 horde united vast eurasian plain under single ruler
gave tsarist russia strong centralized government well deep distrust europe

vernadsky liberal nor communist sympathizer admire bolsheviks rebuilding strong russia non-european lines
critics while g
vernadsky’s writings historical past based upon solid archive sources flight russia separated original materials latest periods
thus critics early editions doubtful certain figures estimates made contemporaneousness pointing out them rather guess hard evidence
after new edition history russia appeared 1930 s
clough columbia university reviewed annals american academy political social science most serious criticism book seems justified discussion soviet period
professor vernadsky russian refugee able throw off anti-bolshevik bias
example discussing five year plan says ”in branches quality manufactured products fell below output before war 30 40 even 50 per cent”
obviously guess quality such various goods produced russia cannot reduced percentage
whole discussion five year plan does take sufficient account labor capital invested future production citing five year plan statistics does state five year plan refers
moreover compares figures issued end first year fifth those preceding year better picture given compared them index number
last paragraph book seems questionable reviewer ”at outset year 1930 new economic policy considered completely abrogated
there begun new experiment militant communism
