stirner's main philosophical work ego own also known ego own einzige und sein eigentum german translates literally unique property
egoism stirner argues concept self something impossible fully comprehend so-called 'creative nothing' described end-point language
stirner broadly understood proponent both psychological egoism ethical egoism although latter position disputed there no claim stirner's writing 'ought to' pursue one's own interest further claiming any 'ought' seen new 'fixed idea'
however may understood rational egoist sense considered irrational act one's self-interest
how self-interest defined however necessarily subjective allowing both selfish altruistic normative claims included
individual self-realization rests each individual's desire fulfill their egoism
difference unwilling willing egoist former will 'possessed' empty idea believe fulfilling higher cause usually being unaware fulfilling their own desires happy secure latter contrast will person able freely choose actions fully aware fulfilling individual desires
sacred things exist egoist does acknowledge himself involuntary egoist
short egoist like egoist abases himself combats egoism same time abases himself sake being exalted therefore gratifying egoism
because like cease egoist looks heaven earth higher beings serve sacrifice himself however much shakes disciplines himself end does own sake
[on] account call involuntary egoist
you each instant you your own creature very 'creature' you wish lose yourself creator
you yourself higher being you surpass yourself
just involuntary egoist you fail recognize therefore 'higher essence' you alien essence
alienness criterion sacred
— ibidem cambridge edition pp
37–8 contrast also expressed terms difference voluntary egoist being possessor concepts opposed being possessed
realizes sacred truths such law right morality religion etc
nothing other artificial concepts obeyed act freely
stirner free both one's own creature sense 'creation' one's own creator dislocating traditional role assigned gods
stirner power method egoism
justified method gaining 'property philosophy'
anarchism stirner proposes most commonly accepted social institutions including notion state property right natural rights general very notion society mere illusionsspooks ghosts mind
advocated egoism form amoralism individuals unite 'unions egoists' their self-interest
property simply comes through might whoever knows how take defend thing belongs property
my power my own
long assert myself holder am proprietor thing
says step shyly back your property look upon my property respect nothing
pray like you call my property! stirner considers world everything including other persons available one's taking use without moral constraint rights exist regard objects people
sees no rationality taking interests others account unless doing furthers one's self-interest believes legitimate reason acting
denies society being actual entity calling society spook individuals reality ego own
union egoists main article union egoists stirner's idea union egoists first expounded ego own
union understood non-systematic association stirner proposed contradistinction state
union understood relation egoists continually renewed parties' support through act will
union requires parties participate out conscious egoism
party silently finds themselves suffering puts up keeps appearance union degenerated something else
union seen authority above person's own will
revolution stirner criticizes conventional notions revolution arguing social movements aimed overturning state tacitly statist because implicitly aimed establishment new state thereafter

possible influence nietzsche main article relationship friedrich nietzsche max stirner ideas max stirner friedrich nietzsche often compared many authors discussed apparent similarities their writings sometimes raising question influence
germany during early years nietzsche's emergence well-known figure thinker discussed connection ideas often stirner schopenhauer
certain nietzsche read ego own mentioned lange's history materialism eduard von hartmann's philosophy unconscious both nietzsche knew well
however there no indication actually read no mention stirner known exist anywhere nietzsche's publications papers correspondence
2002 biographical discovery revealed probable nietzsche encountered stirner's ideas before read hartmann lange october 1865 met eduard mushacke old friend stirner's during 1840 s
yet soon nietzsche's work began reach wider audience question whether owed debt influence stirner raised
early 1891 while nietzsche still alive though incapacitated mental illness eduard von hartmann went far suggest plagiarized stirner
turn century belief nietzsche influenced stirner widespread became something commonplace least germany prompting observer note 1907 stirner's influence modern germany assumed astonishing proportions moves general parallel nietzsche
two thinkers regarded exponents essentially same philosophy
nevertheless beginning characterized great debate regarding stirner's possible positive influence nietzsche serious problems idea noted
middle 20 th century stirner mentioned works nietzsche idea influence often dismissed outright abandoned unanswerable
idea nietzsche influenced way stirner continues attract significant minority perhaps because seems necessary explain oft-noted though arguably superficial similarities their writings
any case most significant problems theory possible stirner influence nietzsche limited difficulty establishing whether man knew read other
also consist establishing precisely how why stirner particular might meaningful influence man widely read nietzsche
rudolf steiner individualist-anarchist orientation rudolf steiner's early philosophy before turned theosophy around 1900 strong parallels admittedly influenced stirner's conception ego steiner claimed provided philosophical foundation
