philosophical writings major themes kolnai eclectic well-read thinker fields philosophy economics politics
major philosophical influences phenomenological school husserl british analytic philosophy
major theme writings effort recover givenness reality sovereignty object order develop common-sense approach philosophy
kolnai drew philosophical realism thomas aquinas believed aquinas provide valuable contribution recovery broad dialectical objectivism opposed rigidity 20 th century neo-thomistic orthodoxy dogmatic claims thomistic ideology
kolnai’s objectivism rests four claims importance ordinary experience provide access real importance secular experience common sense standards ‘tradition’ importance philosophical teachers authorities ‘guide instruct inform’ importance receptivity ‘multiplicity objects modes cognition’ overcome subjectivity kolnai critical martin heidegger’s sartre’s existentialism claiming “they nothing offer doom-consciousness spiced high-sounding idealistic demand—or worse new version aesthete’s surrender active barbarism espousal totalitarian tyranny next best substitute impossible pursuit total freedom
because world fallen tension-ridden kolnai thought christianity should make concern secular world order instill practical reason morality expressed revealing passage war against west personally am inclined think spite christian polish luther’s pessimism pagan hegel’s pagan optimism latter being entirely foreign nineteenth-century progressive constitutionalist views
black despair very core overweening arrogance
true luther wrapped thread-bare guise reckless belief god’s grace independent man’s conduct
hegel other hand preserves elements actual morality
another major theme kolnai’s writings anti-utopianism
daniel mahoney contextualizes kolnai’s anti-utopianism among such thinkers alain besançon václav havel well solzhenitsyn viewed utopian thinking ideological underpinning totalitarianism
kolnai explores calls “utopian mind” phenomenologically links calls “perfectionist illusion” marked view human goods existing state tension somehow reconciled
reconciliation value reality according kolnai “suggests idea rupture given reality world counter-reality ‘set apart
’” kolnai thought identification utopianism search justice misguided led “forced negation ineliminable tensions
quest utopia essence quest world no longer fraught tension human alienation—a quest kolnai saw doomed inevitable failure
kolnai’s political thought arises both phenomenological method belief importance philosophy human life
emphasis common sense practical point view frames political discussions expresses himself genuine conservative praising such concepts social privilege hierarchy
however though kolnai sympathetic called “the conservative ethos” partisan thinker rather self-proclaimed centrist opposed forms totalitarianism
kolnai ongoing concern unrestrained liberalism inevitably end totalitarianism critiques liberalism saw manifest united states europe center preventing such consequences
while supporting cause liberal west affirming pluralism kolnai also aptly stated “to love democracy well necessary love moderately
kolnai’s ethical thought characterized strong loves hates expressed terms values universal meanings
broadly ethical thought described christian imperfectionism opposed elevation morality beyond everyday life
negative character moral duties key kolnai expressed treatise “morality practice ii” speak ‘respecting’ alien property also life rights use word weak sense ‘leaving alone’ ‘not touching’ ‘not interfering with’ much used french medical language rash typhus fever ‘respects’ face
soberer style english textbooks face ‘escapes’ strong sense positive appreciation something distinctively noble respectable
kolnai strongly influenced max scheler’s value ethics thought things viewed axiologically assessed first value opposed language ‘ought’ ‘must’ then provided “a realm approbative disapprobative insights
without stressing unbridgeable gulf ought
thus “value ethics precludes classic pitfalls ethics hedonism eudemonism utilitarianism consequentialism any kind
interpretation moral terms allegedly evident primary natural cognitive experiences various kinds imperativism ‘duty’ cut off good bad interpretation terms either concrete social monarchical fashionable
authority ‘rational ego’ ‘conscience
axiological ethic directs our attention plurality moral values disvalues falseness every monism regard object moral valuation action intention maxim motive virtue vice character course wisdom again ontological perfection
kolnai currently remains relatively unknown especially light dialectical return classical political theory writings leo strauss eric voegelin well recent debates concerning neo-conservative philosophy likely kolnai will receive increasingly attention near future
