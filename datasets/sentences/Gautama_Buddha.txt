scholars hesitant make unqualified claims historical facts buddha's life
most accept lived taught founded monastic order during mahajanapada era during reign bimbisara ruler magadha empire died during early years reign ajasattu successor bimbisara thus making younger contemporary mahavira jain tirthankara
apart vedic brahmins buddha's lifetime coincided flourishing influential śramaṇa schools thoughts like ājīvika cārvāka jainism ajñana
brahmajala sutta records sixty-two such schools thoughts
also age influential thinkers like mahavira pūraṇa kassapa makkhali gosāla ajita kesakambalī pakudha kaccāyana sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta recorded samaññaphala sutta whose viewpoints buddha most certainly must acquainted
[note 5] indeed sariputta moggallāna two foremost disciples buddha formerly foremost disciples sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta skeptic pali canon frequently depicts buddha engaging debate adherents rival schools thoughts
thus buddha just many śramaṇa philosophers time

modern times there attempt form secular understanding siddhārtha gautama's life omitting traditional supernatural elements early biographies
andrew skilton writes buddha never historically regarded buddhist traditions being merely human important stress despite modern theravada teachings contrary often sop skeptical western pupils never seen being merely human
instance often described having thirty-two major eighty minor marks signs mahāpuruṣa superman buddha himself denied either man god mahāparinibbāna sutta states live aeon asked
ancient indians generally unconcerned chronologies being focused philosophy
buddhist texts reflect tendency providing clearer picture gautama may taught dates events life
these texts contain descriptions culture daily life ancient india corroborated jain scriptures make buddha's time earliest period indian history significant accounts exist

[web 6] sources mention kapilavastu birthplace buddha
gethin states earliest buddhist sources state future buddha born siddhārtha gautama pali siddhattha gotama son local chieftain — rājan — kapilavastu pali kapilavatthu now indian–nepalese border
gethin does give references statement
warder 1970 publication indian buddhism oldest extant texts common kernel drawn out
according warder c
publisher kernel doctrine presumably common buddhism period before great schisms fourth third centuries bc
may substantially buddhism buddha himself although cannot proved any rate buddhism presupposed schools existing hundred years after parinirvana buddha there no evidence suggest formulated anyone else buddha immediate followers
richard gombrich greatest difficulty accepting main edifice work single genius
main edifice mean collections main body sermons four nikāyas main body monastic rules
ronald davidson while most scholars agree there rough body sacred literature disputedsic relatively early community disputedsic maintained transmitted little confidence much any surviving buddhist scripture actually word historic buddha
de jong hypocritical assert nothing doctrine earliest buddhism [
basic ideas buddhism found canonical writings very well proclaimed [the buddha] transmitted developed disciples finally codified fixed formulas
bronkhorst position preferred ii purely methodological reasons those seek may find even no success guaranteed
lopez original teachings historical buddha extremely difficult impossible recover reconstruct
