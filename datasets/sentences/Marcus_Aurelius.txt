although part biographer's account lucius fictionalized probably mimic nero whose birthday lucius shared another part poorly compiled better biographical source scholars accepted these biographical details accurate
these name-swaps proven confusing even historia augusta our main source period cannot keep them straight
4 th-century ecclesiastical historian eusebius caesarea shows even confusion
mistaken belief lucius name verus before becoming emperor proven especially popular
there however much precedent
consulate twin magistracy earlier emperors often subordinate lieutenant many imperial offices under antoninus lieutenant marcus
many emperors planned joint succession past—augustus planned leave gaius caesar lucius caesar joint emperors death tiberius wished gaius caligula tiberius gemellus well claudius left empire nero britannicus imagining accept equal rank—but these arrangements ended failure either through premature death gaius lucius caesar judicial murder gemellus caligula britannicus nero
