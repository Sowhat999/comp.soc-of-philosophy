sicily lima cooperated palermo-based mafia operated below surface public life using control large numbers votes enable mutually beneficial relationships local politicians
andreotti lima never spoke me these things
1980 s old low-profile mafia overthrown corleonesi extremely violent faction led fugitive salvatore riina
whereas old mafia bosses cautious violence riina's targeting anti-mafia officials proved ever counter-productive
1982 murders parliamentarian pio torre carabinieri general carlo alberto dalla chiesa led maxi trial
prosecutors disciplined removed except their own self-government board csm given increased powers
after january 1992 upholding maxi trial verdicts definitive convictions supreme court riina embarked renewed campaign claimed lives prosecuting magistrates giovanni falcone paolo borsellino their police guards
