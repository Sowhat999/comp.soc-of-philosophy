initial schooling undertaken during world war ii during time attended lycée carnot
also spent year khâgne lycée henri iv
during nazi occupation france deleuze's older brother georges arrested participation french resistance died while transit concentration camp
1944 deleuze went study sorbonne
teachers there included several noted specialists history philosophy such georges canguilhem jean hyppolite ferdinand alquié maurice de gandillac deleuze's lifelong interest canonical figures modern philosophy owed much these teachers
addition deleuze found work jean-paul sartre attractive
deleuze passed agrégation philosophy 1948 taught various lycées amiens orléans louis le grand until 1957 took up position sorbonne
1953 published first monograph empiricism subjectivity david hume
monograph based des thesis diplôme d'études supérieures fr roughly equivalent ma thesis conducted under direction hyppolite canguilhem
married denise paul fanny grandjouan 1956
1960 1964 held position centre national de recherche scientifique
during time published seminal nietzsche philosophy 1962 befriended michel foucault
1964 1969 professor university lyon
1968 published two dissertations difference repetition supervised gandillac expressionism philosophy spinoza supervised alquié
1969 appointed university paris viii vincennes/st
denis experimental school organized implement educational reform
new university drew number talented scholars including foucault suggested deleuze's hiring psychoanalyst félix guattari
deleuze taught vincennes until retirement 1987
deleuze suffered respiratory ailments young age developed tuberculosis 1968 underwent thoracoplasty lung removal
suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms rest life
last years life simple tasks such handwriting required laborious effort
1995 committed suicide throwing himself window apartment
prior death deleuze announced intention write book entitled grandeur de marx left behind two chapters unfinished project entitled ensembles multiplicities these chapters published essays immanence life actual virtual
buried cemetery village saint-léonard-de-noblat
deleuze himself found little no interest composition autobiography
once asked talk life replied academics' lives seldom interesting
critic seized upon deleuze's unusually long uncut fingernails revealing eccentricity replied haven't got normal protective whorls touching anything especially fabric causes such irritation need long nails protect them
deleuze concludes reply critic thus you know me given believe secrecy?
stick am don't travel around like anyone else make my inner journeys measure my emotions express very obliquely circuitously write
arguments one's own privileged experience bad reactionary arguments
like many contemporaries including sartre foucault deleuze atheist
philosophy deleuze's works fall two groups hand monographs interpreting work other philosophers baruch spinoza gottfried wilhelm leibniz david hume immanuel kant friedrich nietzsche henri bergson foucault artists marcel proust franz kafka francis bacon other eclectic philosophical tomes organized concept e
difference sense events schizophrenia cinema philosophy
regardless topic however deleuze consistently develops variations similar ideas
metaphysics deleuze's main philosophical project works prior collaborations guattari baldly summarized inversion traditional metaphysical relationship identity difference
traditionally difference seen derivative identity e
say x different assumes x least relatively stable identities plato's forms
contrary deleuze claims identities effects difference
identities neither logically nor metaphysically prior difference deleuze argues given there exist differences nature things same genus
no two things ever same categories use identify individuals first place derive differences
apparent identities such x composed endless series differences x = difference x x' x' = difference
difference other words goes way down
confront reality honestly deleuze argues must grasp beings exactly concepts identity forms categories resemblances unities apperception predicates etc
fail attain calls difference itself
philosophy positive direct relation things insofar philosophy claims grasp thing itself according difference everything other words internal difference
like kant bergson deleuze considers traditional notions space time unifying forms imposed subject
therefore concludes pure difference non-spatio-temporal idea deleuze calls virtual
coinage refers proust's definition constant both past present real without being actual ideal without being abstract
while deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble plato's forms kant's ideas pure reason originals models nor transcend possible experience instead conditions actual experience internal difference itself
concept [the conditions] form identical object
deleuzean idea concept difference therefore wraith-like abstraction experienced thing real system differential relations creates actual spaces times sensations
thus deleuze times refers philosophy transcendental empiricism empirisme transcendantal alluding kant friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling
kant's transcendental idealism experience makes sense organized forms sensibility namely space time intellectual categories such causality
assuming content these forms categories qualities world exists independently our perceptual access according kant spawns seductive senseless metaphysical beliefs example extending concept causality beyond possible experience results unverifiable speculation first cause
deleuze inverts kantian arrangement experience exceeds our concepts presenting novelty raw experience difference actualizes idea unfettered our prior categories forcing us invent new ways thinking see below epistemology
simultaneously deleuze claims being univocal
senses affirmed voice
deleuze borrows doctrine ontological univocity medieval philosopher john duns scotus
medieval disputes over nature god many eminent theologians philosophers such thomas aquinas held says god good god's goodness analogous human goodness
scotus argued contrary says god good goodness question exactly same sort goodness meant says jane good
god differs us degree properties such goodness power reason forth univocally applied regardless whether talking god person flea
deleuze adapts doctrine univocity claim being univocally difference
univocity however differences must being difference sense difference
moreover univocal being our individuality remains equivocal univocal being
here deleuze once echoes inverts spinoza maintained everything exists modification substance god nature
deleuze there no substance always-differentiating process origami cosmos folding unfolding refolding
deleuze summarizes ontology paradoxical formula pluralism = monism
difference repetition 1968 deleuze's most sustained systematic attempt work out details such metaphysics other works develop similar ideas
nietzsche philosophy 1962 example reality play forces anti-oedipus 1972 body without organs philosophy? plane immanence chaosmos
epistemology deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails equally atypical epistemology calls transformation image thought
according deleuze traditional image thought found philosophers such aristotle rené descartes edmund husserl misconceives thinking mostly unproblematic business
truth may hard discover—it may require life pure theorizing rigorous computation systematic doubt—but thinking able least principle correctly grasp facts forms ideas etc
may practically impossible attain god's-eye neutral point view ideal approximate disinterested pursuit results determinate fixed truth orderly extension common sense
deleuze rejects view papering over metaphysical flux instead claiming genuine thinking violent confrontation reality involuntary rupture established categories
truth changes think alters think possible
setting aside assumption thinking natural ability recognize truth deleuze says attain thought without image thought determined problems rather solving them
however presupposes codes axioms result chance intrinsic rationality either
it's just like theology everything quite rational you accept sin immaculate conception incarnation
reason region carved out irrational—not sheltered irrational traversed defined particular kind relationship among irrational factors
underneath reason lies delirium drift
deleuze's peculiar readings history philosophy stem unusual epistemological perspective
read philosopher no longer aim finding single correct interpretation instead present philosopher's attempt grapple problematic nature reality
philosophers introduce new concepts explain them don't tell us completely anyway problems those concepts response
history philosophy rather repeating philosopher says say must taken granted didn't say nonetheless present say
likewise rather seeing philosophy timeless pursuit truth reason universals deleuze defines philosophy creation concepts
deleuze concepts identity conditions propositions metaphysical constructions define range thinking such plato's ideas descartes's cogito kant's doctrine faculties
philosophical concept posits itself object same time created
deleuze's view then philosophy closely resembles practical artistic production does adjunct definitive scientific description pre-existing world tradition john locke willard van orman quine
later work roughly 1981 onward deleuze sharply distinguishes art philosophy science three distinct disciplines each analyzing reality different ways
while philosophy creates concepts arts create novel qualitative combinations sensation feeling deleuze calls percepts affects sciences create quantitative theories based fixed points reference such speed light absolute zero deleuze calls functives
according deleuze none these disciplines enjoy primacy over others different ways organizing metaphysical flux separate melodic lines constant interplay another
example deleuze does treat cinema art representing external reality ontological practice creates different ways organizing movement time
philosophy science art equally essentially creative practical
hence instead asking traditional questions identity such true? it? deleuze proposes inquiries should functional practical does do? how does work? values ethics politics deleuze again echoes spinoza albeit sharply nietzschean key
classical liberal model society morality begins individuals bear abstract natural rights duties set themselves god
following rejection any metaphysics based identity deleuze criticizes notion individual arresting halting differentiation etymology word individual suggests
guided naturalistic ethics spinoza nietzsche deleuze instead seeks understand individuals their moralities products organization pre-individual desires powers
two volumes capitalism schizophrenia deleuze guattari describe history congealing regimentation desiring-production concept combining features freudian drives marxist labor modern individual typically neurotic repressed nation-state society continuous control capitalism anarchy domesticated infantilizing commodification
deleuze following karl marx welcomes capitalism's destruction traditional social hierarchies liberating inveighs against homogenization values aims market
how does deleuze square pessimistic diagnoses ethical naturalism? deleuze claims standards value internal immanent live well fully express one's power go limits one's potential rather judge exists non-empirical transcendent standards
modern society still suppresses difference alienates persons
affirm reality flux change difference must overturn established identities become become—though cannot know advance
pinnacle deleuzean practice then creativity
herein perhaps lies secret bring existence judge
disgusting judge because everything equal value contrary because value made distinguished defying judgment
expert judgment art ever bear work come? deleuze's interpretations deleuze's studies individual philosophers artists purposefully heterodox
nietzsche philosophy example deleuze claims nietzsche's genealogy morality 1887 attempt rewrite kant's critique pure reason 1781 even though nietzsche nowhere mentions first critique genealogy genealogy's moral topics far removed epistemological focus kant's book
likewise deleuze claims univocity organizing principle spinoza's philosophy despite total absence term any spinoza's works
deleuze once famously described method interpreting philosophers buggery enculage sneaking behind author producing offspring recognizably yet also monstrous different
various monographs thus attempts present nietzsche spinoza strictly intended re-stagings their ideas different unexpected ways
deleuze's peculiar readings aim enact creativity believes acme philosophical practice
parallel painting deleuze points francis bacon's study after velázquez—it quite beside point say bacon gets velasquez wrong
similar considerations apply deleuze's view own uses mathematical scientific terms pace critics such alan sokal i'm saying resnais prigogine godard thom doing same thing
i'm pointing out rather there remarkable similarities scientific creators functions cinematic creators images
same goes philosophical concepts since there distinct concepts these spaces
reception 1960 s deleuze's portrayal nietzsche metaphysician difference rather reactionary mystic contributed greatly plausibility popularity left-wing nietzscheanism intellectual stance
books difference repetition 1968 logic sense 1969 led michel foucault declare day perhaps century will called deleuzian
deleuze part foucault's comment joke meant make people like us laugh make everyone else livid
1970 s anti-oedipus written style turns vulgar esoteric offering sweeping analysis family language capitalism history via eclectic borrowings freud marx nietzsche dozens other writers received theoretical embodiment anarchic spirit may 1968
1994 1995 l'abécédaire de gilles deleuze eight-hour series interviews deleuze claire parnet aired france's arte channel
1980 s 1990 s almost deleuze's books translated english
deleuze's work frequently cited english-speaking academia 2007 e
th most frequently cited author english-speaking publications humanities freud kant
like contemporaries foucault derrida jean-françois lyotard deleuze's influence most strongly felt north american humanities departments particularly literary theory anti-oedipus thousand plateaus oft regarded major statements post-structuralism postmodernism though neither deleuze nor guattari described their work those terms
likewise english-speaking academy deleuze's work typically classified continental philosophy
moore after citing bernard williams's criteria qualifying great thinker ranks among greatest philosophers
deleuze attracted critics well
philosopher vincent descombes questions deleuze's use expression concept difference writing there concept difference concept intuition then there must purely logical passage intelligible sensible universal particular
descombes also argues deleuze's analysis history anti-oedipus utter idealism criticizing reality falling short non-existent ideal schizophrenic becoming
philosopher manfred frank claims deleuze's theory individuation process bottomless differentiation fails explain unity consciousness
[citation needed] philosopher pascal engel condemns deleuze's thought
according engel deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes impossible reasonably disagree philosophical system destroys meaning truth philosophy itself
engel summarizes deleuze's metaphilosophy thus faced beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back admire
you should question
philosopher stanley rosen objects deleuze's interpretation nietzsche's eternal return
philosopher alain badiou claims deleuze's metaphysics apparently embraces plurality diversity remaining bottom relentlessly monist
badiou further argues practical matters deleuze's monism entails ascetic aristocratic fatalism akin ancient stoicism
political philosopher todd may argues deleuze's claim difference ontologically primary ultimately contradicts embrace immanence
however may believes deleuze discard primacy-of-difference thesis accept wittgensteinian holism without significantly altering practical philosophy
fashionable nonsense 1997 physicists alan sokal jean bricmont accuse deleuze abusing mathematical scientific terms particularly sliding accepted technical meanings own idiosyncratic use those terms works
see above deleuze's interpretations
sokal bricmont state don't object metaphorical reasoning including mathematical concepts mathematical scientific terms useful insofar precise
give examples mathematical concepts being abused taking them out their intended meaning rendering idea normal language reduces truism nonsense
their opinion deleuze used mathematical concepts typical reader might knowledgeable thus served display erudition rather enlightening reader
sokal bricmont state deal abuse mathematical scientific concepts explicitly suspend judgment deleuze's wider contributions
philosopher slavoj žižek claims deleuze's ontology oscillates materialism idealism deleuze anti-oedipus arguably deleuze's worst book political deleuze under 'bad' influence guattari ends up despite protestations contrary ideologist late capitalism
žižek also calls deleuze task allegedly reducing subject just another substance thereby failing grasp nothingness according lacan žižek defines subjectivity
political philosopher peter hallward argues deleuze's insistence being necessarily creative always-differentiating entails philosophy offer no insight supremely indifferent material actual conditions existence
thus hallward claims deleuze's thought literally other-worldly aiming passive contemplation dissolution identity theophanic self-creation nature
