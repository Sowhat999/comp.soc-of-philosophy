largely self-taught
great many anecdotal autobiographical teaching stories collected sidney rosen book my voice will go you
erickson identified many earliest personal experiences hypnotic autohypnotic
erickson grew up lowell wisconsin modest farming family intended become farmer like father
late developer both dyslexic color blind
overcame dyslexia many other inspirations via series spontaneous autohypnotic flashes light creative moments described paper autohypnotic experiences milton h
age 17 contracted polio severely paralysed doctors believed die
critical night worst another formative autohypnotic experience
e lay bed night overheard three doctors tell my parents other room their boy dead morning
felt intense anger anyone should tell mother her boy dead morning
my mother then came serene face
asked her arrange dresser push up against side bed angle
she understand why she thought delirious
my speech difficult
angle virtue mirror dresser see through doorway through west window other room
damned die without seeing sunset
any skill drawing still sketch sunset
r your anger wanting see another sunset way you kept yourself alive through critical day spite doctors' predictions
why you call autohypnotic experience? e saw vast sunset covering whole sky
know there also tree there outside window blocked out
r you blocked out? selective perception enables you say you altered state? e yes consciously
saw sunset didn't see fence large boulder there
blocked out everything except sunset
after saw sunset lost consciousness three days
finally awakened asked my father why taken out fence tree boulder
realize blotted them out fixed my attention intensely sunset
then recovered became aware my lack abilities wondered how going earn living
already published paper national agricultural journal
why young folks leave farm
no longer strength farmer maybe make doctor
recovering still almost entirely lame bed unable speak became strongly aware significance non-verbal communication - body language tone voice way these non-verbal expressions often directly contradicted verbal ones
polio totally paralyzed inflammation great sensory paralysis too
move my eyes my hearing undisturbed
got very lonesome lying bed unable move anything except my eyeballs
quarantined farm seven sisters brother two parents practical nurse
how entertain myself? started watching people my environment
soon learned my sisters say no meant yes
say yes mean no same time
offer another sister apple hold back
began studying nonverbal language body language
baby sister begun learn creep
learn stand up walk
you imagine intensity watched my baby sister grew creeping learning how stand up
began recall body memories muscular activity own body
concentrating these memories slowly began regain control parts body point eventually able talk use arms
still unable walk decided train body further embarking - alone - thousand-mile canoe trip few dollars
after grueling trip able walk cane
experience may contributed erickson's technique using ordeals therapeutic context see below
erickson avid medical student curious engaged psychiatry obtained psychology degree while still studying medicine
much later fifties developed post-polio syndrome characterized pain muscle weakness caused chronic over-use partially paralyzed muscles
condition left even severely paralyzed having through experience once before now strategy recovering use muscles employed again
after second recovery obliged use wheelchair suffered chronic pain controlled self-hypnosis usually takes me hour after awaken get pain out
used easier younger
muscle joint difficulties now
recently way get control over pain sitting bed pulling chair close pressing my larynx against back chair
very uncomfortable discomfort deliberately creating
early 1950 s anthropologist/cyberneticist gregory bateson involved erickson consultant part extensive research communication

systems covert hypnosis developers richard bandler john grinder steve andreas stephen gilligan notable practitioners paul mc kenna fazal inayat-khan martin weaver organisations association neuro linguistic programming vte erickson believed unconscious mind listening whether patient trance suggestions made hypnotic influence long those suggestions found resonance unconscious level
patient aware completely oblivious something happening
erickson see patient respond another kind indirect suggestion allow unconscious mind participate actively therapeutic process
way seemed like normal conversation might induce hypnotic trance therapeutic change subject
according weitzenhoffer [erickson's] conception unconscious definitely held freud
erickson irrepressible practical joker uncommon slip indirect suggestions kinds situations including own books papers lectures seminars
example student arrived five-day intensive seminars held home office near end life
erickson asked why she come she replied frankly my teacher me should come see you before you died
erickson smiled you tell dying last thing intend
[citation needed] group laughed pun
then erickson twinkle eye you want know how avoid dying? wake up every morning
you want know how ensure you will wake up every morning? continued drink lots liquids before you go sleep![citation needed] erickson also believed even appropriate therapist go trance
go trances will sensitive intonations inflections my patients' speech
enable me hear better see better
erickson maintained trance common everyday occurrence
example waiting buses trains reading listening even being involved strenuous physical exercise it's quite normal become immersed activity go trance state removed any other irrelevant stimuli
these states common familiar most people consciously recognise them hypnotic phenomena
same situation evidence everyday life however whenever attention fixated question experience amazing unusual anything holds person's interest
such moments people experience common everyday trance tend gaze off right left depending upon cerebral hemisphere most dominant baleen 1969 get faraway blank look
their eyes may actually close their bodies tend become immobile form catalepsy certain reflexes e
swallowing respiration etc
may suppressed seem momentarily oblivious their surroundings until completed their inner search unconscious level new idea response frames reference will restabilize their general reality orientation
hypothesize everyday life consciousness continual state flux general reality orientation momentary microdynamics trance
because erickson expected trance states occur naturally frequently prepared exploit them therapeutically even patient present consulting room
also discovered many techniques increasing likelihood trance state occur
developed both verbal non-verbal techniques pioneered idea common experiences wonderment engrossment confusion fact just kinds trance
clearly there great many kinds trance
many people familiar idea deep trance earlier career erickson pioneer researching unique remarkable phenomena associated state spending many hours time individual test subjects deepening trance
trance may light deep suggests one-dimensional continuum trance depth erickson often work multiple trances same patient example suggesting hypnotised patient behave awake thereby blurring line hypnotic awake state
erickson believed there multiple states may utilized
resonates charles tart's idea put forward book waking up states consciousness trances call normal waking consciousness just consensus trance
nlp also makes central use idea changing state without explicitly being hypnotic phenomenon
indirect techniques classical hypnosis authoritative direct often encounters resistance subject erickson's approach permissive accommodating indirect
example classical hypnotist might say you going trance ericksonian hypnotist likely say you comfortably learn how go trance
way provides opportunity subject accept suggestions most comfortable their own pace awareness benefits
subject knows being hustled takes full ownership participates their transformation
because induction takes place during course normal conversation ericksonian hypnosis often known covert conversational hypnosis
erickson maintained possible consciously instruct unconscious mind authoritarian suggestions likely met resistance
unconscious mind responds openings opportunities metaphors symbols contradictions
effective hypnotic suggestion then should artfully vague leaving space subject fill gaps their own unconscious understandings - even consciously grasp happening
skilled hypnotherapist constructs these gaps meaning way most suited individual subject - way most likely produce desired change
example authoritative you will stop smoking likely find less leverage unconscious level you become non-smoker
first direct command obeyed ignored notice draws attention act smoking second opening invitation possible lasting change without pressure less likely raise resistance
richard bandler john grinder identified kind artful vagueness central characteristic their 'milton model' systematic attempt codify erickson's hypnotic language patterns
confusion technique my techniques almost there confusion
confused person their conscious mind busy occupied very much inclined draw upon unconscious learnings make sense things
confused person trance their own making - therefore goes readily trance without resistance
confusion might created ambiguous words complex endless sentences pattern interruption myriad other techniques incite transderivational searches
scottish surgeon james braid coined term hypnotism claimed focused attention essential creating hypnotic trances indeed thesis hypnosis essence state extreme focus
difficult people racked pain fear suspicion focus anything
thus other techniques inducing trance become important erickson explained
long frequent use confusion technique many times effected exceedingly rapid hypnotic inductions under unfavourable conditions such acute pain terminal malignant disease persons interested hostile aggressive resistant
handshake induction among erickson's best-known innovations hypnotic handshake induction type confusion technique
induction done hypnotist going shake hands subject then interrupting flow handshake way such grabbing subject's wrist instead
handshake continues develop way out-of-keeping expectations simple non-verbal trance created may then reinforced utilized hypnotist
these responses happen naturally automatically without telling subject consciously focus idea
richard bandler people erickson taught handshake technique
however clear bandler embedded parts fact impossible erickson such gradually lessening pressure right hand course impossible erickson since almost completely paralysed right hand
bandler talks videos creating therapeutic change
[dubious discuss] induction works because shaking hands actions learned operated single chunk behavior tying shoelaces another classic example
behavior diverted frozen midway person literally no mental space - stopped middle unconsciously executing behavior hasn't got middle
mind responds suspending itself trance until either something happens give new direction snaps out
skilled hypnotist often use momentary confusion suspension normal processes induce trance quickly easily
various descriptions erickson's hypnotic handshake including own very detailed accounts indicate certain amount improvisation involved watching acting upon subject's responses key successful outcome
erickson described routine follows initiation begin shaking hands normally
hypnotic touch then begins let loose
letting loose becomes transformed firm grip gentle touch thumb lingering drawing away little finger faint brushing subject's hand middle finger - just enough vague sensation attract attention
subject gives attention touch your thumb you shift touch your little finger
your subject's attention follows you shift touch your middle finger then again thumb
arousal attention merely arousal without constituting stimulus response
subject's withdrawal handshake arrested attention arousal establishes waiting set expectancy
then almost quite simultaneously ensure separate neural recognition you touch undersurface hand wrist gently barely suggests upward push
followed similar utterly slight downward touch then sever contact gently subject does know exactly - subject's hand left going neither up nor down cataleptic
termination you don't want your subject know you doing you simply distract their attention usually appropriate remark casually terminate
sometimes remark you say? got absentminded there moment wasn't paying attention anything
slightly distressing subjects indicative fact their attention focused fixated peculiar hand stimuli momentarily entranced hear
utilisation any utilisation leads increasing trance depth
utilisation should proceed continuation extension initial procedure
much done nonverbally example any subjects just looking blankly me may slowly shift my gaze downward causing them look their hand touch say look spot
intensifies trance state
then whether subjects looking you their hand just staring blankly you use your left hand touch their elevated right hand above side - long you merely give suggestion downward movement
occasionally downward nudge push required
strong push nudge required check anaesthesia
richard bandler keen proponent handshake induction developed own variant commonly taught nlp workshops
any habitual pattern interrupted unexpectedly will cause sudden light trance
handshake particularly good pattern interrupt because formality handshake widely understood set social rules
since everyone knows impolite comment quality handshake regardless how strange may subject obliged embark inner search known transderivational search universal compelling type trance identify meaning purpose subverted pattern
resistance erickson recognised many people intimidated hypnosis therapeutic process took care respect special resistances individual patient
therapeutic process you give patient every opportunity resist
here relevant quotes pertaining resistance whatever behaviour offered subjects should accepted utilized develop further responsive behaviour
any attempt correct alter subjects' behaviour force them things interested militates against trance induction certainly deep trance experience
patient led accept suggestion will readily accept others
resistant patients becomes necessary find suggestion accept
resistance important should respected resistance itself encouraged patient made feel comfortable because know allowed respond however wish
many times apparently active resistance encountered subjects no unconscious measure testing hypnotist's willingness meet them halfway instead trying force them act entirely accord ideas
although idea working resistance essentially hypnotic goes beyond hypnosis trance
typical example girl bit her nails she cheating herself really enjoying nail biting
encouraged her let her nails grow little longer before biting them she really derive fullest pleasure activity
she decided grow her nails long enough she might really enjoy biting them then after days she realised she didn't want bite them anyway
ericksonian therapy erickson most famous hypnotherapist extensive research experience hypnosis led develop effective therapeutic technique
many these techniques explicitly hypnotic extensions hypnotic strategies language patterns
erickson recognised resistance trance resembles resistance change developed therapeutic approach awareness
haley identified several strategies appeared repeatedly erickson's therapeutic approach
encouraging resistance - erickson classic therapeutic request tell me everything
both aggressive disrespectful instead ask resistant patient withhold information tell really ready reveal usually say there number things you don't want me know you don't want tell me
there lot things yourself you don't want discuss therefore let's discuss those you willing discuss
she blanket permission withhold anything everything
she come discuss things
therefore she starts discussing discussing
it's well right talk
before she's finished she mentioned everything
each new item - well really isn't important withhold
use withholding permission important matters
simply hypnotic technique
make them respond idea withholding respond idea communicating
people might react direction thinking why should i? you can't make me called polarity response because motivates subject consider polar opposite suggestion
conscious mind recognizes negation speech don't x according erickson unconscious mind pays attention x injunction don't
erickson thus used basis suggestions deliberately played negation tonally marked important wording provide whatever client beneficial you don't go trance you easily wonder you notice no faster you feel ready become aware your hand slowly rising
providing worse alternative 'double bind' - example you want go trance now later? 'double bind' way overloading subject two options acceptance either represents acceptance therapeutic suggestion
my first well-remembered intentional use double bind occurred early boyhood
winter day weather below zero my father led calf out barn water trough
after calf satisfied thirst turned back barn doorway calf stubbornly braced feet despite my father's desperate pulling halter budge animal
outside playing snow observing impasse began laughing heartily
my father challenged me pull calf barn
recognizing situation unreasoning stubborn resistance part calf decided let calf full opportunity resist since apparently wished
accordingly presented calf double bind seizing tail pulling away barn while my father continued pull inward
calf promptly chose resist weaker two forces dragged me barn
communicating metaphor - explored extensively sydney rosen's my voice will go you example given first chapter david gordon's book phoenix returning high school day runaway horse bridle sped past group us farmer's yard looking drink water
horse perspiring heavily
farmer didn't recognize cornered
hopped horse's back
since bridle took hold tick rein giddy-up
headed highway knew horse turn right direction
didn't know right direction
horse trotted galloped along
now then forget highway start field
pull bit call attention fact highway supposed
finally four miles boarded turned farm yard farmer that's how critter came back
you find him? four miles here
how you know you should come here? didn't know
horse knew
keep attention road
erickson's metaphorical strategies compared teaching tales sufis those example nasreddin zen tradition koans each also designed act unconscious mind
encouraging relapse - bypass simple short-lived obedience tends lead lapses absence therapist erickson occasionally arrange patients fail their attempts improve example overreaching
failure part life fragile time patient learning live think behave differently random failure catastrophic
deliberately causing relapse allowed erickson control variables failure cast positive therapeutic light patient
encouraging response frustrating - paradoxical approach acts directly patient's own resistance change
obese patients asked gain weight family therapy session stubbornly silent family member ignored until frustration obliges them blurt out desperate truth
once again approach roots erickson's hypnotic language patterns form don't want you go trance yet
compare prescribing symptom below
utilizing space position - hypnosis therapy experienced subjectively patient any part their total experience used reinforce idea
physical position even posture patient significant part subjective experience
manipulating these factors contribute therapeutic transformation
send someone out room - example mother child - carefully move father chair put mother's chair
send child out might put mother child's chair least temporarily
sometimes comment saying 'as you sit your son sitting you think clearly
'if you sit your husband sat maybe will give you somewhat view me'
over series interviews entire family shuffle them originally mother's chair now father sitting
family grouping remains yet family grouping being rearranged you after changing family
may directly compared fritz perls' use empty chair context imagined interactions client often invited occupy chair thus take role person imagined sitting there bert hellinger's approach requires client arrange family members played volunteers row pattern matches client's internal understanding then reorganise row virginia satir's work tableaux posture
emphasizing positive - erickson claimed sensory disabilities dyslexia colour blindness being tone-deaf helped focus aspects communication behavior most other people overlooked
typical example emphasizing positive
erickson often compliment patient symptom even encourage very specific ways
amusing example woman whose in-laws caused her nauseous feelings gut every time visited unexpectedly taught vomit spectacularly whenever visits especially inconvenient
naturally in-laws sympathetically help her clean up vomit
fairly soon annoying relatives started calling advance before turning up see she well enough see them
subject dozens songs emphasizing positive well known self-help strategy compared positive reformulation gestalt therapy
prescribing symptom amplifying deviation - very typically erickson instruct patients actively consciously perform symptom bothering them see nailbiting example under #resistance usually minor trivial deviation original symptom
many cases deviation amplified used wedge transform whole behaviour
interviewer suppose someone called you there kid nineteen twenty years old very good boy sudden week started walking around neighborhood carrying large cross
neighbors upset family's upset you something
how you think problem? kind bizarre behavior like
erickson well kid came see me first thing want examine cross
want improve very minor way
soon got slightest minor change way open larger change
pretty soon deal advantages different cross - ought least two
ought least three make choice each day
it's pretty hard express psychotic pattern behavior over ever-increasing number crosses
seeding ideas - erickson often ensure patients exposed idea often metaphorical form hidden conscious mind advance utilizing therapeutic purpose
called seeding ideas observed occur many levels both coarse fine grained many case histories
simple example question you ever trance before? seeds idea trance imminent - presupposition inherent word before now later
avoiding self-exploration - common most brief therapy practitioners erickson entirely uninterested analysing patient's early psychological development
occasionally case histories will briefly discuss patient's background much pertains resources available patient present
interviewer you don't feel exploring past particularly relevant? i'm trying get clear my mind how much past need consider doing brief therapy
erickson you know patient last july four five years psychoanalysis got nowhere
someone knows her how much attention you give past? you know completely forgot
patient think reasonably cured person
severe washing compulsion much twenty hours day
didn't go cause etiology searching question asked you get shower scrub yourself hours tell me you start top your head soles your feet middle? you wash neck down you start your feet wash up? you start your head wash down? interviewer why you ask that? erickson she knew really interested
interviewer you join her this? erickson no she knew really interested
shocks ordeals erickson famous pioneering indirect techniques shock therapy tends get less attention
erickson prepared use psychological shocks ordeals order achieve given results old gentleman asked helped fear riding elevator probably scare pants off another direction
me nothing worse fear elevator
elevators particular building operated young girls made special arrangements advance
she agreed cooperate thought fun
went gentleman elevator
wasn't afraid walking elevator started move became unbearable experience
chose unbusy time walk out elevator back out
then point walked girl close door let's go up
she went up story stopped floors
gentleman started yell what's wrong! elevator operator wants kiss you
shocked gentleman i'm married man! girl don't mind
she walked toward stepped back you start elevator
she started
she went up fourth floor stopped again floors
she just craving kiss
you go your business
wanted elevator moving standing still
she replied well let's go down start over again she began take elevator down
down up! since didn't want go through over again
she started up then stopped elevator floors you promise you'll ride down my elevator me you're through work? i'll promise anything you promise kiss me
went up elevator relieved without fear - elevator - ride then
controversy erickson's work hypnotism controversial during lifetime remained present day
central presuppositions questioned other researchers opaque nature explanations led variety competing interpretations approach
friend colleague erickson hypnosis researcher andré weitzenhoffer prolific well-respected author field hypnosis himself extensively criticised ideas influence erickson various writings such textbook practice hypnotism
weitzenhoffer displays clear explicitly stated bias against ericksonian hypnosis book favor terms semi-traditional scientific approach
author jeffrey masson dedicated whole sub-section book against therapy criticism milton erickson
masson questions accuracy erickson's case reports
regarding erickson's report female patient allegedly hypnotised spontaneous orgasms throughout day masson writes whole thing tinged fantasy feeling unreality
masson particularly concerned erickson's own reports cases acted manner felt might construed sexually inappropriate
even goes far suggest erickson may obtained sexual pleasure cases like following reports asking young female client gradually strip naked office allegedly psychotherapeutic exercise
note however mrs erickson present room
furthermore erickson presents case illustrating power shock therapy against inhibitions rigidities character claiming technique freed patient her incapacity marry her fiancé
now you need know how undress go bed presence man
start undressing
slowly almost automatic fashion she undressed
her show me her right breast her left breast her right nipple her left nipple
her belly button
her genital area
her knees
her gluteal [buttock] regions
asked her point she like her husband kiss her
her turn around [naked]
her dress slowly
she dressed
dismissed her
masson also notes erickson psychiatrist arizona state hospital enthusiastic advocate use restraints subject delivered well-attended talk frequently patients confined straitjackets
masson cites various instances erickson's behaviour toward psychiatric patients considers cruel crude jokes
referring erickson's authoritarian approach prison-camp therapy therapist-as-boss masson concludes surprising erickson succumbed opportunity abuse patients examples quoted make clear
self-professed skeptical hypnotist alex tsander cited masson's concerns 2005 book beyond erickson fresh look emperor hypnosis title alludes charcot's characterisation previous century emperor neuroses
tsander re-evaluates swathe erickson's accounts therapeutic approaches lecture demonstrations context scientific literature hypnotism own experience giving live demonstrations hypnotic technique
emphasising social-psychological perspectives tsander introduces interpretive filter re-evaluates erickson's own accounts demonstrations introduces prosaic explanations occurrences both erickson other authors tend portray remarkable
influence others erickson's friend sometime collaborator andre weitzenhoffer well-known hypnosis researcher himself repeatedly raised concerns over nature erickson's legacy
majority today's ericksonians consist individuals never known erickson even less directly trained
today time now much teaching ericksonian approach done individuals acquired their knowledge second third hand
those spend time erickson like jeffrey zeig ernest rossi william o'hanlon tried believe present preserve much believed understood erickson's thought methods
succeeded fair degree
others like richard bandler john grinder other hand offered much adulterated times fanciful version perceived erickson saying doing guided their personal theorizing
further distortions resulted outside united states due translation problems well other reasons
