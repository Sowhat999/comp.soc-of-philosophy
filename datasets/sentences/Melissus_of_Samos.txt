may born around 500 bc date death unknown
little known mostly gleaned small passage plutarch’s life pericles
commander samian fleet long before peloponnesian war defeated pericles athenian fleet 441 bc
plutarch claims aristotle says melissus also defeated pericles earlier battle
life themistocles plutarch denies stesimbrotus’ claim melissus held high regard themistocles claiming confusing themistocles pericles
melissus reputed pupil parmenides teacher leucippus though must regard such claims fair amount skepticism
overview much remains melissus’ philosophical treatise nature preserved simplicius commentaries aristotle’s physics heavens several summaries philosophy come down us
most remaining fragments found diels–kranz
unlike parmenides melissus treatise prose poetry consequently making easier follow teacher
like parmenides claims being ungenerated indestructible indivisible changeless motionless same
melissus’ philosophy differs parmenides two respects parmenides claims being limited while melissus claims wholly unlimited 2 parmenides being existed timeless present while melissus being eternal
mc kirahan claims parmenides argues being spatially limited contentious point
philosophy eternal melissus argues since neither came nor subject destruction therefore eternal
while fragment merely summary parmenides’ arguments against coming perishing
5-21 fragment 2 provides melissus’ argument
melissus’ argument twofold addressing temporal aspect somewhat timeline granting reality present moment argues existed eternally past will exist eternally future
argument follows whatever comes must beginning
according fragment come
therefore does beginning
therefore eternal existed past
addition whatever beginning must also end
according fragment beginning
therefore will end
therefore eternal will exist future
restates argument eternal fragments 6 9
respect melissus differs parmenides although argue difference important might seem
parmenides’ view there moment eternal present while melissus argues infinite number moments
existence changeless motionless eternal present arguable position after change motion depend time however existence changeless motionless infinite succession moments much difficult position defend after there no other change there still temporal change change moment next
there several problems melissus’ reasoning
second argument based faulty premise
whatever comes must also end point
furthermore both arguments reduced “if then not-a therefore not-b” logically flawed
unlimited melissus contends unlimited
fragments 7 apparently indicate melissus speaking terms spatial infinity although regarding fragment 3 first argues point simplicius explicitly denies “but ‘magnitude’ does mean extended space
simplicius undoubtedly melissus’ treatise disposal well other commentaries notes survived present day
any case melissus’ argument claim unclear possible preserved us
alternatively may intend argument follow arguments fragments 2 either directly indirectly
former case unless argument based now lost theory relationship time space mc kirahan says “grossly fallacious”
latter case granting “beginning” “end” fragment 2 spatial well temporal qualities leaves melissus open charge equivocation
fragment 6 melissus connects eternal existence quality being unlimited
melissus may argued quality due certain issues arising parmenides’ thesis
argument follows whatever beginning end neither eternal nor unlimited
being no beginning end
therefore eternal unlimited
argument fragment 3 logically flawed being basically “if not-a then not-b”
melissus’ argument oneness what-is given mainly fragments 7 undoubtedly best
argument clearer concise provided parmenides
melissus argues because what-is unlimited must also because limits namely boundaries what-is other existing objects
argument founded premises what-is both spatially temporally unlimited follows what-is temporally unlimited
therefore nothing else spatially unlimited exist different time
what-is spatially unlimited
therefore nothing else temporally unlimited exist same time
therefore what-is
same melissus xenophanes gorgias pseudo-aristotle states melissus made claim qualitatively same
validity argument depends nature unity intended melissus
possible single thing different parts human head body two arms two legs still human
most respects melissus following parmenides’ footsteps likely melissus arguing same type unity parmenides namely completely unified no parts subdivide
argument follows what-is qualitative differences plural
what-is whole itself
therefore what-is no qualitative differences
provided second-hand report pseudo-aristotle however quality wholeness major claim parmenides’ thesis likely melissus either made argument point fragment come down us expected understood inferred other arguments
changeless melissus argues cannot undergo any change
specifically states cannot rearranged become greater smaller undergo any kind distress may safely expand argument include kinds change
underwent any kind change whatsoever become different thus no long unified whole
argument follows whatever undergoes change altered
whatever altered unified whole
unified whole
therefore does undergo any type change
motionless fragment 9
7-10 melissus makes argument motionless qualities full empty
states full because empty nothing nothing doesn’t exist
then states because full can’t move
argument follows empty nothing
nothing does exist
therefore empty
empty must full
therefore full
further whatever motion full
whatever full
no empty spaces must motionless
therefore motionless
incorporeal fragment 5 melissus makes remarkable claim incorporeal
just insistence unlimited claim may also attempt address potential problem inherent parmenides’ philosophy
argument follows whole itself
therefore no parts
therefore no thickness
therefore does body
argument surface does coincide melissus’ claim extended full
after why something extended any parts how something full no thickness? mc kirahan offers interesting interpretation melissus may arguing
body extension also limits something infinitely large such unlimited object then no limits body
furthermore thickness simply measure distance body’s limits
since unlimited cannot thickness
influence reactions while influential fellow eleatics melissus' treatise important impact philosophy
whether leucippus student clear treatise influential atomism those other eleatics
furthermore because clear concise nature melissus' version eleatic philosophy chief source presentation works plato aristotle
aristotle never hesitated insult melissus whom viewed quite inferior predecessors stating work bit crude made invalid arguments starting false assumptions
aristocles well little admiration melissus calling several arguments absurd
melissus fared somewhat better eyes modern philosophers
inventive philosopher good quality offering clear direct arguments
although follows parmenides general views framework eleaticism made original contributions innovations substance eleatic philosophy
