overview major works performative acts gender constitution 1988 essay judith butler proposes her theory gender performativity later taken up 1990 throughout her work gender trouble
she begins grounding her theory gender performativity feminist phenomenological point view
she suggests both phenomenology feminism ground their theory lived experience
further comparing merleau-ponty french phenomenologist simone de beauvoir judith butler reveals both theories view sexual body historical idea situation she accepts notion distinction sex biological facticity gender cultural interpretation signification facticity
combination theories essential founding butler's view theatrical performative genders society
butler argues valid perceive gender performance individual agent acts
performative element her theory suggests social audience
butler script gender performance effortlessly transmitted generation generation form socially established meanings she states gender radical choice
[nor it] imposed inscribed upon individual
given social nature human beings most actions witnessed reproduced internalized thus take performative theatric quality
currently actions appropriate men women transmitted produce social atmosphere both maintains legitimizes seemingly natural gender binary
consistent her acceptance body historical idea she suggests our concept gender seen natural innate because body becomes gender through series acts renewed revised consolidated through time
she argues performance gender itself creates gender
additionally butler compares performativity gender performance theater
she brings many similarities including idea each individual functioning actor their gender
however she also brings light critical difference gender performance reality theater performances
she explains how theater much less threatening does produce same fear gender performances often encounter because fact there clear distinction reality within theater
butler uses freud's notion how person's identity modeled terms normal
she revises freud's notion concept's applicability lesbianism freud says lesbians modeling their behavior men perceived normal ideal
she instead says gender works way performativity representing internalized notion gender norms
gender trouble feminism subversion identity 1990 main article gender trouble gender trouble first published 1990 selling over 100000 copies internationally different languages
[citation needed] alluding similarly named 1974 john waters film female trouble starring drag queen divine gender trouble critically discusses works simone de beauvoir julia kristeva sigmund freud jacques lacan luce irigaray monique wittig jacques derrida most significantly michel foucault
book also enjoyed widespread popularity outside traditional academic circles even inspiring intellectual fanzine judy!
crux butler's argument gender trouble coherence categories sex gender sexuality—the natural-seeming coherence example masculine gender heterosexual desire male bodies—is culturally constructed through repetition stylized acts time
these stylized bodily acts their repetition establish appearance essential ontological core gender
[citation needed] sense butler famously theorizes gender along sex sexuality performative
performance gender sex sexuality however voluntary choice butler locates construction gendered sexed desiring subject within she calls borrowing foucault's discipline punish regulative discourses
these also called frameworks intelligibility disciplinary regimes decide advance possibilities sex gender sexuality socially permitted appear coherent natural
[citation needed] regulative discourse includes within disciplinary techniques coercing subjects perform specific stylized actions maintain appearance those subjects core gender sex sexuality discourse itself produces
significant yet sometimes overlooked part butler's argument concerns role sex construction natural coherent gender sexuality
butler explicitly challenges biological accounts binary sex reconceiving sexed body itself culturally constructed regulative discourse
supposed obviousness sex natural biological fact attests how deeply production discourse concealed
sexed body once established natural unquestioned fact alibi constructions gender sexuality unavoidably cultural their appearance purport just-as-natural expressions consequences fundamental sex
butler's account basis construction natural binary sex binary gender heterosexuality likewise constructed natural
way butler claims without critique sex produced discourse sex/gender distinction feminist strategy contesting constructions binary asymmetric gender compulsory heterosexuality will ineffective
thus showing both terms gender sex socially culturally constructed butler offers critique both terms even used feminists
butler argued feminism made mistake trying make “women” discrete ahistorical group common characteristics
butler approach reinforces binary view gender relations because allows two distinct categories men women
butler believes feminists should try define “women” she also believes feminists should “focus providing account how power functions shapes our understandings womanhood society large also within feminist movement”
finally butler aims break supposed links sex gender gender desire flexible free floating caused other stable factors
idea identity free flexible gender performance essence foundations queer theory
imitation gender insubordination 1990 judith butler explores production identities such homosexual heterosexual limiting nature identity categories
identity category her result certain exclusions concealments thus site regulation
however butler also acknowledges categorized identities important political action present times
important idea work also identity forms through repetition acts imitation due certain original identity exists prior repetition
imitation gives illusion continuity produces identities
same way heterosexual identity set up ideal requires constant compulsive repetition protect very identity repetition created
bodies matter discursive limits sex 1993 bodies matter seeks clear up readings supposed misreadings performativity view enactment sex/gender daily choice
butler emphasizes role repetition performativity making use derrida's theory iterability form citationality work out theory performativity terms iterability performativity cannot understood outside process iterability regularized constrained repetition norms
repetition performed subject repetition enables subject constitutes temporal condition subject
iterability implies 'performance' singular 'act' event ritualized production ritual reiterated under through constraint under through force prohibition taboo threat ostracism even death controlling compelling shape production will insist determining fully advance
concept linked butler's discussion performativity
iterability endless undeterminedness to-be-determinedness thus precisely aspect performativity makes production natural sexed gendered heterosexual subject possible while also same time opening subject up possibility incoherence contestation
[jargon] excitable speech politics performative 1997 main article performativity § judith butler's perspective performativity excitable speech butler surveys problems hate speech censorship
she argues censorship difficult evaluate cases may useful even necessary while others may worse tolerance
she develops new conception censorship's complex workings supplanting myth independent subject wields power censor theory censorship effect state power primordially condition language discourse itself
[citation needed] butler argues hate speech exists retrospectively after being declared such state authorities
way state reserves itself power define hate speech conversely limits acceptable discourse
connection butler criticizes feminist legal scholar catharine mac kinnon's argument against pornography unquestioning acceptance state's power censor
[citation needed] deploying foucault's argument first volume history sexuality butler claims any attempt censorship legal otherwise necessarily propagates very language seeks forbid
foucault argues example strict sexual mores 19 th century western europe nothing amplify discourse sexuality sought control
extending argument using derrida lacan butler claims censorship primitive language linguistic mere effect originary censorship
way butler questions possibility any genuinely oppositional discourse speech depends upon censorship then principle might seek oppose once formative principle oppositional speech
butler also questions efficacy censorship grounds hate speech context-dependent
citing j
austin's concept performative utterance butler notes words' ability “do things” makes hate speech possible also same time dependent specific embodied context
[citation needed] austin's claim word does illocutionary force varies context uttered implies impossible adequately define performative meanings words including hate abstractly
[citation needed] basis butler rejects arguments like richard delgado's justify censorship certain specific words claiming use those words constitutes hate speech any context
way butler underlines difficulty inherent efforts systematically identify hate speech
undoing gender 2004 undoing gender collects butler's reflections gender sex sexuality psychoanalysis medical treatment intersex people general readership many her other books
butler revisits refines her notion performativity focuses question undoing restrictively normative conceptions sexual gendered life
butler discusses how gender performed without being conscious says does mean performativity automatic mechanical
she argues desires originate our personhood rather social norms
writer also debates our notions human less-than-human how these culturally imposed ideas keep having viable life biggest concerns usually whether person will accepted her desires differ normality
she states may feel need being recognized order live same time conditions recognized make life unlivable
writer proposes interrogation such conditions people resist them may possibilities living
her discussion intersex butler addresses case david reimer person whose sex medically reassigned male female after botched circumcision eight months age
reimer made female doctors later life identified really male married became stepfather wife's three children went tell story nature made boy raised girl john colapinto
reimer committed suicide 2004
giving account oneself 2005 giving account oneself butler develops ethics based opacity subject itself other words limits self-knowledge
primarily borrowing theodor adorno michel foucault friedrich nietzsche jean laplanche adriana cavarero emmanuel levinas butler develops theory formation subject
she theorizes subject relation social community others their norms beyond control subject forms precisely very condition subject's formation resources subject becomes recognizably human grammatical first place
butler accepts claim subject opaque itself limitations free ethical responsibility obligations due limits narrative presuppositions language projection
“ you may think am fact telling story prehistory subject arguing cannot
there two responses objection
there no final adequate narrative reconstruction prehistory speaking does mean cannot narrate means moment narrate become speculative philosophers fiction writers
2 prehistory never stopped happening such prehistory any chronological sense
done over relegated past then becomes part causal narrative reconstruction self
contrary prehistory interrupts story give myself makes every account myself partial failed constitutes way my failure fully accountable my actions my final irresponsibility may forgiven because otherwise
being able otherwise our common predicament page 78
instead she argues ethics based precisely limits self-knowledge limits responsibility itself
[citation needed] any concept responsibility demands full transparency self itself entirely accountable self necessarily does violence opacity marks constitution self addresses
scene address responsibility enabled already relation subjects variably opaque themselves each other
ethics butler envisions therefore responsible self knows limits knowing recognizes limits capacity give account itself others respects those limits symptomatically human
[citation needed] take seriously one's opacity oneself ethical deliberation means then critically interrogate social world comes human first place remains precisely cannot know oneself
way butler locates social political critique core ethical practice
[citation needed] reception butler receives theodor w
adorno award butler’s work influential feminist queer theory cultural studies continental philosophy
yet her contribution range other disciplines — such psychoanalysis literary film performance studies well visual arts — also significant
her theory gender performativity well her conception critically queer transformed understandings gender queer identity academic world shaped mobilized various kinds political activism particularly queer activism across globe
butler's work also entered contemporary debates teaching gender gay parenting depathologization transgender people
indeed influential butler's challenge traditional notions sex gender even pope benedict xvi written critically
many academics political activists maintain butler’s radical departure sex/gender dichotomy her non-essentialist conception gender — along her insistence power helps form subject — revolutionized feminist queer praxis thought studies
darin barney mc gill university writes “ butler's work gender sex sexuality queerness feminism bodies political speech ethics changed way scholars over world think talk write identity subjectivity power politics
also changed lives countless people whose bodies genders sexualities desires made them subject violence exclusion oppression
others scholars critical
1998 denis dutton's journal philosophy literature awarded butler first prize fourth annual bad writing competition set out celebrate bad writing most stylistically lamentable passages found scholarly books articles
her unwitting entry ran 1997 issue scholarly journal diacritics ran thusly “ move structuralist account capital understood structure social relations relatively homologous ways view hegemony power relations subject repetition convergence rearticulation brought question temporality thinking structure marked shift form althusserian theory takes structural totalities theoretical objects insights contingent possibility structure inaugurate renewed conception hegemony bound up contingent sites strategies rearticulation power
dutton discontinued contest after critics opposed hostile spirit
critics accused butler elitism due her difficult prose style while others claim she reduces gender discourse promotes form gender voluntarism
susan bordo example argued butler reduces gender language contending body major part gender thus implicitly opposing butler's conception gender performed
particularly vocal critic liberal feminist martha nussbaum argued butler misreads j
austin's idea performative utterance makes erroneous legal claims forecloses essential site resistance repudiating pre-cultural agency provides no normative ethical theory direct subversive performances butler endorses
finally nancy fraser's critique butler part famous exchange two theorists
fraser suggested butler's focus performativity distances her “everyday ways talking thinking ourselves
[…] why should use such self-distancing idiom?” butler responded criticisms her prose preface her 1999 book gender trouble
recently several critics - most prominently viviane namaste - criticised judith butler’s undoing gender under-emphasizing intersectional aspects gender-based violence
example timothy laurie notes butler's use phrases like “gender politics” “gender violence” relation assaults transgender individuals usa [scour] landscape filled class labour relations racialised urban stratification complex interactions sexual identity sexual practices sex work produce instead clean surface struggles over 'the human' imagined play out
nevertheless both namaste laurie acknowledge enduring importance butler's critical contributions study gender identities
political activism much butler's early political activism centered around queer feminist issues she served period time chair board international gay lesbian human rights commission
over years she particularly active gay lesbian rights feminist anti-war movements
she also written spoken out issues ranging affirmative action gay marriage wars iraq afghanistan prisoners detained guantanamo bay
recently she active occupy movement publicly expressed support version 2005 bds boycott divestment sanctions campaign against israel
september 7 2006 butler participated faculty-organized teach-in against 2006 lebanon war university california berkeley
another widely publicized moment occurred june 2010 butler refused civil courage award zivilcouragepreis christopher street day csd parade berlin germany award ceremony
she cited racist comments part organizers general failure csd organizations distance themselves racism general anti-muslim excuses war specifically
criticizing event's commercialism she went name several groups she commended stronger opponents homophobia transphobia sexism racism militarism
october 2011 butler attended occupy wall street reference calls clarification protesters' demands she people asked demands? demands these people making? either say there no demands leaves your critics confused say demands social equality economic justice impossible demands

adorno affair butler received adorno prize prize committee came under attack israel's ambassador germany yakov hadas-handelsman director simon wiesenthal center office jerusalem efraim zuroff german central council jews
upset butler's selection because her remarks israel specifically her calls boycott against israel
butler responded saying she take attacks german jewish leaders personally
rather she attacks directed against everyone critical against israel current policies
letter mondoweiss website butler asserted she developed strong ethical views basis jewish philosophical thought blatantly untrue absurd painful anyone argue those formulate criticism state israel anti-semitic jewish self-hating
comments hamas hezbollah butler criticized statements she made hamas hezbollah
she described them “social movements progressive left part global left”
she accused defending hezbollah hamas progressive organizations supporting their tactics
butler responded these criticisms stating her remarks hamas hezbollah taken completely out context badly wittingly distort her established views non-violence
she repeatedly condemned violence non-democratic actions these groups while clearly advocating politics committed non-violence
recent interview she explained hamas hezbollah progressive insofar address infrastructural needs quite acute under occupation
precisely because such groups supplying important social services becomes harder—yet urgent—to find ways persuading people support their violent tactics
butler describes origin her remarks hamas hezbollah following way asked member academic audience few years ago whether thought hamas hezbollah belonged “the global left” replied two points
my first point merely descriptive those political organizations define themselves anti-imperialist anti-imperialism characteristic global left basis describe them part global left
my second point then critical any group left decide whether group against group needs critically evaluate their stand
