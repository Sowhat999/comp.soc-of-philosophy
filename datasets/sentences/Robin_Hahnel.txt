among early writings marxism socialist theory evaluation marxist marxist–leninist theory emphasized believed serious flaws
albert hahnel argued while those aspects marxist theory rejecting institutions private property markets well-founded other aspects marxist marxist–leninist doctrine including economistic bias dialectical methodology historical materialism class concepts labour theory value crises theory rejection visionary thinking authoritarian values tendencies either partially wholly flawed often constituted obstacles struggle social justice

ecological economics throughout much time hahnel teaching advanced courses ecological economics american university
ecological economic vision seeks incorporate ecological social costs entailed production consumption distribution price signals each good

first major book authored without michael albert panic rules
book features concise analysis crises due financial liberalization era globalization critique ideology practices global institutions such wto imf world bank tightly argued explanation conditional insights much overlooked limitations international trade theory based upon ricardo's theory comparative advantage
hahnel acknowledged core insights within comparative advantage theory noting opportunity costs producing goods different different countries there potential gains specialization trade
however explained potential gains realized under specific conditions expounded many real world factors account significant efficiency losses
among most significant factors efficiency losses trade inaccurate prices due significant externalities cause misidentification comparative advantages unstable international markets create macro inefficiencies adjustment costs moving people out industries considerable
moreover spite ricardo's theory international trade usually aggravates global inequality because terms trade set inequitably result dominant bargaining positions northern countries thanks class structures ensure costs benefits trade distributed unfairly within countries
