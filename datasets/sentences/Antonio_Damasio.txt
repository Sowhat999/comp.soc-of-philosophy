damasio's main field neurobiology especially neural systems subserve[further explanation needed] emotion decision-making memory language consciousness
damasio might believe emotions play critical role high-level cognition—an idea counter dominant 20 th-century views psychology neuroscience philosophy
[citation needed] damasio 2008
damasio formulated somatic marker hypothesis theory how emotions their biological underpinnings involved decision-making both positively negatively often non-consciously
emotions provide scaffolding construction social cognition required self processes undergird consciousness
[citation needed] damasio provides contemporary scientific validation linkage feelings body highlighting connection mind nerve cells
personalized embodiment mind
somatic marker hypothesis inspired many neuroscience experiments carried out laboratories u
europe major impact contemporary science philosophy
damasio named institute scientific information most highly cited researchers past decade
current work biology moral decisions neuro-economics social communication drug-addiction strongly influenced damasio's hypothesis
[citation needed]an article published archives scientific psychology 2014 named damasio 100 most eminent psychologist modern era
diener et al
archives scientific psychology 2014 2 20-32
june–july issue sciences humaines included damasio list 50 key thinkers human sciences past two centuries
damasio also proposed emotions part homeostatic regulation rooted reward/punishment mechanisms
recovered james' perspective feelings read-out body states expanded as-if-body-loop device allows substrate feelings simulated rather actual foreshadowing simulation process later uncovered mirror neurons
demonstrated experimentally insular cortex critical platform feelings finding widely replicated uncovered cortical subcortical induction sites human emotions e
ventromedial prefrontal cortex amygdala
also demonstrated while insular cortex plays major role feelings necessary feelings occur suggesting brain stem structures play basic role feeling process
continued investigate neural basis feelings demonstrated although insular cortex major substrate process exclusive suggesting brain stem nuclei critical platforms well
regards feelings necessary foundation sentience
another development damasio proposed cortical architecture learning recall depend involves multiple hierarchically organized loops axonal projections converge certain nodes out projections diverge points origin convergence convergence-divergence zones
architecture applicable understanding memory processes aspects consciousness related access mental contents
feeling happens damasio laid foundations enchainment precedences “the nonconscious neural signaling individual organism begets protoself permits core self core consciousness allow autobiographical self permits extended consciousness
end chain extended consciousness permits conscience
damasio's research depended significantly establishing modern human lesion method enterprise made possible hanna damasio's structural neuroimaging/neuroanatomy work complemented experimental neuroanatomy gary van hoesen josef parvizi experimental neuropsychology antoine bechara ralph adolphs dan tranel functional neuroimaging kaspar meyer jonas kaplan mary helen immordino-yang
experimental neuroanatomy work van hoesen bradley hyman led discovery disconnection hippocampus caused neurofibrillary tangles entorhinal cortex patients alzheimer’s disease

damasio's books deal relationship emotions feelings their brain substrates
1994 book descartes' error emotion reason human brain won science et vie prize finalist los angeles times book award translated over 30 languages
regarded most influential books past two decades
second book feeling happens body emotion making consciousness named ten best books 2001 new york times book review publishers weekly best book year library journal best book year over 30 foreign editions

damasio suggested spinoza's thinking foreshadowed discoveries biology neuroscience views mind-body problem spinoza protobiologist
damasio's latest book self comes mind constructing conscious brain
damasio suggests self key conscious minds feelings kind designates primordial well-known feelings emotion basic elements construction protoself core self
