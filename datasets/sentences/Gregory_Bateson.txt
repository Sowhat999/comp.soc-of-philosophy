bateson lifelong atheist family several generations
philosophy others might see set inexplicable details bateson perceived simple relationships
versailles cybernetics bateson argues history twentieth century perceived history malfunctioning relationship
view treaty versailles exemplifies whole pattern human relationships based betrayal hate
therefore claims treaty versailles development cybernetics—which represented possibility improved relationships—are two anthropologically important events twentieth century
work wwii office strategic services career although initially reluctant join intelligence services bateson served oss during world war ii along dozens other anthropologists
spent much war designing 'black propaganda' radio broadcasts
deployed covert operations burma thailand worked china india ceylon well
bateson used theory schismogenesis help foster discord among enemy fighters
upset wartime experience disagreed wife over whether science should applied social planning used foster understanding rather action
early work new guinea bali bateson’s beginning years anthropologist spent floundering lost without specific objective mind
began first trip new guinea spurred mentor
goal suggested haddon explore effects contact sepik natives whites
unfortunately bateson time spent baining new guinea halted difficult
baining turned out secretive excluded many aspects their society
occasion tricked missing communal activities held out their religion
left them frustrated
next studied sulka another native population new guinea
although sulka dramatically different baining their culture much visible observer felt their culture dying left feeling dispirited discouraged
experienced success iatmul another indigenous people sepik river region new guinea
return idea communications relations interactions among people
observations made iatmul allowed develop concept schismogenesis
studied 'naven' honorific ceremony among iatmul still continued today celebrates first-time cultural achievements
ceremony entails many antics normally forbidden during everyday social life
example men women reverse exaggerate gender roles men dress women's skirts women dress men's attire ornaments
additionally certain categories female kin smear mud faces other relatives beat them sticks hurl bawdy insults
mothers may drop ground their celebrated 'child' walks over them
during male rite mother's brother may slide buttocks down leg honoured sister's son complex gesture masculine birthing pride insult rarely performed before women brings honoured sister's son tears
bateson suggested influence circular system causation proposed women watched spectacular performances men there no reasonable doubt presence audience very important factor shaping men's behavior
fact probable men exhibitionistic because women admire their performances
conversely there no doubt spectacular behavior stimulus summons audience together promoting women appropriate behavior
[page needed] short behaviour person x affects person reaction person person x's behaviour will then affect person x's behaviour turn will affect person
bateson called vicious circle
then discerned two models schismogenesis symmetrical complementary
symmetrical relationships those two parties equals competitors such sports
complementary relationships feature unequal balance such dominance-submission parent-child exhibitionism-spectatorship performer-audience
bateson’s experiences iatmul led publish book 1936 titled naven survey problems suggested composite picture culture new guinea tribe drawn three points view cambridge university press
book proved watershed anthropology modern social science
until bateson published naven most anthropologists assumed realist approach studying culture simply described social reality
bateson's book argued approach naive since anthropologist's account culture fundamentally shaped whatever theory anthropologist employed define analyse data
think otherwise stated bateson guilty alfred north whitehead called fallacy misplaced concreteness
there no singular self-evident way understand iatmul naven rite
instead bateson analysed rite three unique points view sociological ethological eidological
book then presentation anthropological analysis epistemological account explored nature anthropological analysis itself
sociological point view sought identify how ritual helped bring social integration
1930 s most anthropologists understood marriage rules regularly ensure social groups renewed their alliances
iatmul argued bateson contradictory marriage rules
marriage other words guarantee marriage two clans definite point future recur
instead bateson continued naven rite filled function regularly ensuring exchanges food valuables sentiment mothers' brothers their sisters' children separate lineages
naven angle held together different social groups each village unified whole
ethological point view interpreted ritual terms conventional emotions associated normative male female behaviour bateson called ethos
iatmul culture observed bateson men women lived different emotional lives
example women rather submissive took delight achievement others men fiercely competitive flamboyant
during ritual however men celebrated achievement their nieces nephews while women given ritual license act raucously
effect naven allowed men women experience momentarily emotional lives each other thereby achieve level psychological integration
third final point view eidological least successful
here bateson endeavoured correlate organisation structure naven ceremony habitual patterns iatmul thought
much later bateson harness very same idea development double-bind theory schizophrenia
epilogue book bateson clear writing book experiment rather series experiments methods thinking anthropological material
say overall point describe iatmul culture naven ceremony explore how different modes analysis using different premises analytic frameworks lead different explanations same sociocultural phenomenon
bateson's approach re-shape fundamentally anthropological approach culture naven rite itself remained locus classicus discipline
fact meaning ritual continues inspire anthropological analysis
bateson next travelled bali new wife margaret mead
studied people balinese village bajoeng gede
here lipset states short history ethnographic fieldwork film used both large scale primary research tool
indeed bateson took 25000 photographs their balinese subjects
bateson discovered people bajoeng gede raised their children very unlike children raised western societies
instead attention being paid child displaying climax emotion love anger balinese mothers ignore them
bateson notes child responds [a mother's] advances either affection temper response falls vacuum
western cultures such sequences lead small climaxes love anger bali
moment child throws arms around mother's neck bursts tears mother's attention wanders
model stimulation refusal also seen other areas culture
bateson later described style balinese relations stasis instead schismogenesis
their interactions muted follow schismogenetic process because often escalate competition dominance submission
after bali bateson mead returned sepik river 1938 settled village tambunum bateson spent three days 1920 s
aimed replicate balinese project relationship childraising temperament conventions body such pose grimace holding infants facial expressions etc
reflected wider cultural themes values
bateson snapped 10000 black white photographs mead typed thousands pages fieldnotes
bateson mead never published anything substantial research

double bind main article double bind 1956 palo alto bateson colleagues donald jackson jay haley john weakland articulated related theory schizophrenia stemming double bind situations
double bind refers communication paradox described first families schizophrenic member
first place double binds described though named such according bateson samuel butler's way flesh semi-autobiographical novel victorian hypocrisy cover-up
full double bind requires several conditions met[citation needed] victim double bind receives contradictory injunctions emotional messages different levels communication example love expressed words hate detachment nonverbal behaviour child encouraged speak freely criticised silenced whenever she actually does
no metacommunication possible example asking two messages valid describing communication making no sense
victim cannot leave communication field
failing fulfill contradictory injunctions punished example withdrawal love
strange behaviour speech schizophrenics explained bateson et al
expression paradoxical situation seen fact adaptive response should valued cathartic transformative experience
double bind originally presented probably mainly under influence bateson's psychiatric co-workers explanation part etiology schizophrenia
currently considered important example bateson's approach complexities communication understood
[citation needed] role somatic change evolution according merriam-webster's dictionary term somatic basically defined body body cells change distinguished germplasm psyche/mind
bateson writes how actual physical changes body occur within evolutionary processes
describes through introduction concept economics flexibility
conclusion makes seven statements theoretical positions may supported ideology
first idea although environmental stresses theoretically believed guide dictate changes soma physical body introduction new stresses automatically result physical changes necessary survival suggested original evolutionary theory
fact introduction these stresses greatly weaken organism
example gives sheltering sick person weather fact someone works office hard time working rock climber vice versa
second position states though economics flexibility logical structure-each successive demand upon flexibility fractioning set available possibilities
means theoretically speaking each demand variable creates new set possibilities
bateson's third conclusion genotypic change commonly makes demand upon adjustive ability soma
states commonly held belief among biologists although there no evidence support claim
added demands made soma sequential genotypic modifications fourth position
through suggests following three expectations idea organisms through recent modifications will delicate
belief these organisms will become progressively harmful dangerous
over time these new “breeds” will become resistant stresses environment change genetic traits
fifth theoretical position bateson believes supported data characteristics within organism modified due environmental stresses may coincide genetically determined attributes
sixth position takes less economic flexibility create somatic change does cause genotypic modification
seventh final theory believes supported idea rare occasions there will populations whose changes will accordance thesis presented within paper
according bateson none these positions time tested called creation test possibly prove disprove theoretical positions suggested within
ecological anthropology cybernetics book steps ecology mind bateson applied cybernetics field ecological anthropology concept homeostasis
saw world series systems containing those individuals societies ecosystems
within each system found competition dependency
each these systems adaptive changes depend upon feedback loops control balance changing multiple variables
bateson believed these self-correcting systems conservative controlling exponential slippage
saw natural ecological system innately good long allowed maintain homeostasis key unit survival evolution organism environment
bateson also viewed three systems individual society ecosystem together part supreme cybernetic system controls everything instead just interacting systems
supreme cybernetic system beyond self individual equated many people refer god though bateson referred mind
while mind cybernetic system distinguished whole parts
bateson felt mind immanent messages pathways supreme cybernetic system
saw root system collapses result occidental western epistemology
according bateson consciousness bridge cybernetic networks individual society ecology mismatch systems due improper understanding will result degradation entire supreme cybernetic system mind
bateson thought consciousness developed through occidental epistemology direct odds mind
heart matter scientific hubris
bateson argues occidental epistemology perpetuates system understanding purpose means-to-an-end driven
purpose controls attention narrows perception thus limiting comes consciousness therefore limiting amount wisdom generated perception
additionally occidental epistemology propagates false notion man exists outside mind leads man believe bateson calls philosophy control based upon false knowledge
bateson presents occidental epistemology method thinking leads mindset man exerts autocratic rule over cybernetic systems
exerting autocratic rule man changes environment suit doing unbalances natural cybernetic system controlled competition mutual dependency
purpose-driven accumulation knowledge ignores supreme cybernetic system leads eventual breakdown entire system
bateson claims man will never able control whole system because does operate linear fashion man creates own rules system opens himself up becoming slave self-made system due non-linear nature cybernetics
lastly man's technological prowess combined scientific hubris gives potential irrevocably damage destroy supreme cybernetic system instead just disrupting system temporally until system self-correct
bateson argues position humility acceptance natural cybernetic system instead scientific arrogance solution
believes humility come abandoning view operating through consciousness alone
consciousness way obtain knowledge without complete knowledge entire cybernetic system disaster inevitable
limited conscious must combined unconscious complete synthesis
thought emotion combined whole man able obtain complete knowledge
believed religion art few areas man acting whole individual complete consciousness
acting greater wisdom supreme cybernetic system whole man change relationship mind schism endlessly tied up constant competition complementarity
bateson argues culture promotes most general wisdom able flexibly change within supreme cybernetic system
other terms used bateson abduction
used bateson refer third scientific methodology along induction deduction central own holistic qualitative approach
refers method comparing patterns relationship their symmetry asymmetry example comparative anatomy especially complex organic mental systems
term originally coined american philosopher/logician charles sanders peirce used refer process scientific hypotheses generated
criteria mind mind nature necessary unity mind aggregate interacting parts components
interaction parts mind triggered difference
mental process requires collateral energy
mental process requires circular complex chains determination
mental process effects difference regarded transforms coded versions difference preceded them
description classification these processes transformation discloses hierarchy logical types immanent phenomena
creatura pleroma
borrowed carl jung applied these gnostic terms seven sermons dead
like hindu term maya basic idea captured distinction meaning organisation projected onto world
pleroma refers non-living world undifferentiated subjectivity creatura living world subject perceptual difference distinction information
term coined 1940 s referring organisation learning learning learn schismogenesis emergence divisions within social groups
information bateson defined information difference makes difference
bateson information fact mediated alfred korzybski's map–territory relation thereby resolved according bateson mind-body problem
