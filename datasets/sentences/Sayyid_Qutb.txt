believed formed part impetus rejection western values move towards islamism upon returning egypt
resigning civil service joined muslim brotherhood early 1950 s became editor-in-chief brothers' weekly al-ikhwan al-muslimin later head propaganda section well appointed member working committee guidance council highest branch organization
nasser qutb's death july 1952 egypt's pro-western government overthrown nationalist free officers movement headed gamal abdel nasser
both qutb muslim brotherhood welcomed coup against monarchist government—which saw un-islamic subservient british imperialism—and enjoyed close relationship movement prior immediately following coup
nasser go house syed qutb ask ideas revolution
[citation needed] many members brotherhood expected nasser establish islamic government
however cooperation brotherhood free officers marked revolution's success soon soured became clear secular nationalist ideology nasserism incompatible islamism brotherhood
nasser secretly set up organisation sufficiently oppose muslim brotherhood once came power
organisation called tahreer freedom arabic
well known brotherhood made popular their extensive social programs egypt nasser wanted ready once taken over
time qutb realize nasser's alternate plans continue meet sometimes 12 hours day discuss post monarch egypt
once qutb realized nasser taken advantage secrecy free officers brotherhood promptly quit
nasser then tried persuade qutb offering any position wanted egypt except kingship saying will give you whatever position you want government whether it's ministry education ministry arts etc
qutb refused every offer having understood reality nasser's plans
upset nasser enforce government based islamic ideology qutb other brotherhood members orchestrated plot assassinate egyptian president 1954
attempt foiled qutb jailed soon afterwards egyptian government used incident justify crackdown various members muslim brotherhood their vocal opposition towards nasser administration
during first three years prison conditions bad qutb tortured
later years allowed mobility including opportunity write
period saw composition two most important works commentary qur'an fi zilal al-qur'an shade qur'an manifesto political islam called ma'alim fi-l-tariq milestones
these works represent final form qutb's thought encompassing radically anti-secular anti-western claims based interpretations qur'an islamic history social political problems egypt
school thought inspired become known qutbism
qutb let out prison end 1964 behest prime minister iraq abdul salam arif months before being rearrested august 1965
accused plotting overthrow state subjected consider show trial
many charges placed against qutb court taken directly ma'alim fi-l-tariq adamantly supported written statements
trial culminated death sentence qutb six other members muslim brotherhood
sentenced death part conspiracy assassinate president other egyptian officials personalities though instigator leader actual plot
29 august 1966 executed hanging
evolution thought views statements theological stances qutb held belief matters cannot seen imperceptible important sign man's ability accept knowledge fields outside science concept imperceptible decisive factor distinguishing man animal
materialist thinking ancient well modern tended drag man back irrational existence no room spiritual everything determined sensory means alone
peddled 'progressive thought' no dismal regression
secularism different theories advanced why qutb turned away secularist tendencies towards islamic sharia
common explanation conditions witnessed prison 1954–1964 including torture murder muslim brothers convinced government bound islamic law prevent such abuses
another qutb's experiences america darker-skinned person insufficiently anti-western policies nasser demonstrated powerful dangerous allure ignorance jahiliyyah—a threat unimaginable qutb's estimation secular mind
two excerpts opening book milestones contain following view necessary new leadership preserve develop material fruits creative genius europe also provide mankind such high ideals values far remained undiscovered mankind will also acquaint humanity way life harmonious human nature positive constructive practicable
democracy west become infertile such extent borrowing systems eastern bloc especially economic system under name socialism
same eastern bloc
social theories foremost among marxism beginning attracted large number people east also west way life based creed
now marxism defeated plane thought stated single nation world truly marxist will exaggeration
whole theory conflicts man's nature needs
ideology prospers degenerate society society become cowed result form prolonged dictatorship
now even under these circumstances materialistic economic system failing although foundation structure based
russia leader communist countries itself suffering shortages food
although during times tsars russia used produce surplus food now import food abroad sell reserves gold purpose
main reason failure system collective farming say failure system against human nature
finally qutb offered own explanation ma'alim fi-l-tariq arguing anything non-islamic evil corrupt while following sharia complete system extending aspects life bring every kind benefit humanity personal social peace treasures universe
general qutb's experiences egyptian muslim—his village childhood professional career activism muslim brotherhood—left unmistakable mark theoretical religious works
even qutb's early secular writing shows evidence later themes
example qutb's autobiography childhood tifl min al-qarya child village makes little mention islam political theory typically classified secular literary work
however replete references village mysticism superstition qur'an incidences injustice
qutb's later work developed along similar themes dealing qur'anic exegesis social justice political islam
qutb's career writer also heavily influenced philosophy
al-taswiir al-fanni fil-quran artistic representation qur'an qutb developed literary appreciation qur'an complementary methodology interpreting text
hermeneutics applied extensive commentary qur'an fi zilal al-qur'an shade quran served foundation declarations ma'alim fi-l-tariq
late life qutb synthesized personal experiences intellectual development famous ma'alim fi-l-tariq religious political manifesto believed true islamic system
also text qutb condemned muslim governments such abdul nasser's regime egypt secular their legitimacy based human thus corrupt rather divine authority
work any other established qutb premier islamists 20 th century
events led secularism islam qutb people shift secularism islam
journey started studied qur'an literal way slowly began understand principles lined religion
then something happened america remove doubts
says while going america boat ferry saw way boat travelling in—was rocking huge sea—all under control allah without sinking capsizing
point realized power allah
iman belief entered heart due

qutb's political philosophy described attempt instantiate complex multilayer eschatological vision partly grounded counter-hegemonic re-articulation traditional ideal islamic universalism
following 1952 coup espoused 'just dictatorship' 'grant political liberties virtuous alone
later rule sharia law require essentially no government
earlier work qutb described military jihad defensive islam's campaign protect itself while later believed jihad must offensive
issue islamic governance qutb differed many modernist reformist muslims claimed democracy islamic because quranic institution shura supported elections democracy
qutb pointed out shura chapter qur'an revealed during mekkan period therefore does deal problem government
makes no reference elections calls ruler consult ruled particular case general rule shura
qutb also opposed then popular ideology arab nationalism having become disillusioned 1952 nasser revolution after having exposed regime's practices arbitrary arrest torture deadly violence during imprisonment
antisemitism sayyid qutb staunch antisemite
1950 published book our struggle against jews forms central part today's islamist antisemitism
view harmony man qutb felt strongly world meant serve man understood properly
islam teaches god created physical world forces man's own use benefit
man specifically taught directed study world around discover potential utilize environment own good good fellow humans
any harm man suffers hands nature result ignorance lack understanding laws governing
man learns nature peaceful harmonious relationship nature environment
hence notion conquering nature readily seen cynical negative
alien islamic perceptions betrays shameless ignorance spirit world created divine wisdom underlies
jahiliyyah versus freedom exposure abuse power undoubtedly contributed ideas famous prison-written islamic manifesto ma'alim fi-l-tariq milestones advocated political system opposite dictatorship—i
no government
there qutb argued much muslim world approaches qur'an means simply acquire culture information participate academic discussions enjoyment
evades real purpose rather should approached means change society remove man enslavement other men servitude god
rather support rule pious few whether dictators democratically elected muslims should resist any system men servitude other men—i
obey other men—as un-islamic violation god's sovereignty hakamiyya over creation
truly islamic polity no rulers—not even theocratic ones—since muslims need neither judges nor police obey divine law
observer called kind anarcho-islam
way bring freedom revolutionary vanguard
fight jahiliyyah twofold approach preaching abolishing organizations authorities jahili system physical power jihad
vanguard movement grow preaching jihad until formed truly islamic community then spread throughout islamic homeland finally throughout entire world attaining leadership humanity
while those defeated attacks treacherous orientalists! might define jihad narrowly defensive islamically correct jihad according qutb fact offensive defensive
qutb emphasized struggle anything easy
true islam transform every aspect society eliminating everything non-muslim
true muslims look forward lives poverty difficulty frustration torment sacrifice
jahili ersatz-muslims jews westerners fight conspire against islam elimination jahiliyyah
criticisms though work motivated mobilized muslims qutb also critics
following publication milestones aborted plot against nasser government mainstream muslims took issue qutb's contention physical power jihad used overthrow governments attack societies institutions traditions muslim—but according qutb jahili—world
ulama al-azhar university school took unusual step following death putting sayyid qutb their index heresy declaring deviant munharif
reformist muslims other hand questioned understanding sharia
perfect complete completely accessible people thus solution any their problems
also criticized dismissal non-muslim culture many centuries muslim learning culture beauty following first four caliphs un-islamic thus worthless
conservative criticism went further condemning qutb's islamist/reformist ideas—such social justice redistributive economics banning slavery—as western bid‘ah innovative innovations islam being forbidden
accused qutb amateur scholarship overuse ijtihad innovation ijma qutb felt should limited scholars should conducted muslims declaring unlawful allah made lawful assorted mistakes aqeedah belief manhaj methodology
legacy alongside notable islamists like maulana mawdudi hasan al-banna ruhollah khomeini qutb considered most influential muslim thinkers activists modern era ideas also many see martyr's death
according authors daniel benjamin steven simon sayyid qutb fused together core elements modern islamism kharijites' takfir ibn taymiyya's fatwas policy prescriptions rashid rida's salafism maududi's concept contemporary jahiliyya hassan al-banna's political activism
qutb's written works still widely available translated many western languages
best known work ma'alim fi-l-tariq milestones majority qutb's theory found qur'anic commentary fi zilal al-qur'an shade quran
30-volume work noteworthy innovative method interpretation borrowing heavily literary analysis amin al-khuli while retaining structural features classical commentaries example practice progressing first sura last

influence al-qaeda felt through writing followers especially through brother muhammad qutb moved saudi arabia following release prison egypt became professor islamic studies edited published promoted brother sayyid's work
muhammad qutb's students later ardent follower ayman zawahiri went become member egyptian islamic jihad later mentor osama bin laden leading member al-qaeda
zawahiri first introduced qutb uncle maternal family patriarch mafouz azzam very close qutb throughout life
azzam qutb's student then protégé then personal lawyer executor estate—one last people see qutb before execution
according lawrence wright interviewed azzam young ayman al-zawahiri heard again again beloved uncle mahfouz purity qutb's character torment endured prison
zawahiri paid homage qutb work knights under prophet's banner

anwar al-awlaki osama bin laden also acquainted sayyid's brother muhammad qutb
close college friend bin laden's mohammed jamal khalifa wright bin laden regularly attended weekly public lectures muhammad qutb king abdulaziz university bin laden both read sayyid qutb
most affected our generation
while imprisoned yemen anwar al-awlaki became influenced works qutb
read 150–200 pages day qutb's works describing himself during course reading immersed author feel sayyid me my cell speaking me directly
other hand associate professor history creighton university john calvert states al-qaeda threat monopolized distorted our understanding qutb's real contribution contemporary islamism
recognition 9/11 commission report chapter 2 9/11 commission report 2004 foundation new terrorism cites qutb influencing osama bin laden's worldview these terms [qutb] dismissed western achievements entirely material arguing 'nothing will satisfy own conscience justify existence
12] three basic themes emerge qutb's writings
first claimed world beset barbarism licentiousness unbelief condition called jahiliyya religious term period ignorance prior revelations given prophet mohammed
qutb argued humans choose islam jahiliyya
second warned people including muslims attracted jahiliyya material comforts view islam jahiliyya therefore triumph over islam
third no middle ground exists qutb conceived struggle god satan
muslim—as defined them—therefore must take up arms fight
any muslim rejects ideas just nonbeliever worthy destruction
