decision analysis society annually awards frank p
ramsey medal recognise substantial contributions decision theory application important classes real decision problems
work mathematical logic theorems proved ramsey 1928 paper problem formal logic now bears name ramsey's theorem
while theorem work ramsey probably best remembered proved passing minor lemma along way true goal paper solving special case decision problem first-order logic namely decidability now called bernays–schönfinkel–ramsey class first-order logic well characterisation spectrum sentences fragment logic
alonzo church go show general case decision problem first-order logic unsolvable see church's theorem
great amount later work mathematics fruitfully developed out ostensibly minor lemma turned out important early result combinatorics supporting idea within sufficiently large systems however disordered there must order
fruitful fact ramsey's theorem today there entire branch mathematics known ramsey theory dedicated studying similar results
philosophy philosophical works included universals 1925 facts propositions 1927 proposed redundancy theory truth universals law fact 1928 knowledge 1929 theories 1929 truth 1929 general propositions causality 1929
wittgenstein mentions introduction philosophical investigations influence
economics keynes pigou encouraged ramsey work economics very early age sixteen think precocious mind intensely interested economic problems keynes 1933
ramsey responded keynes's urging writing three papers economic theory fundamental importance though many years before received their proper recognition community economists
ramsey's three papers described below detail subjective probability utility 1926 optimal taxation 1927 optimal one-sector economic growth 1928
economist paul samuelson described them 1970 three great legacies legacies most part mere by-products major interest foundations mathematics knowledge
mathematical theory saving significant paper published economic journal involved strategically beautiful application calculus variations paul samuelson[citation needed] determine optimal amount economy should invest save rather consume maximise future utility ramsey's words how much income should nation save? ramsey 1928
keynes described article most remarkable contributions mathematical economics ever made both respect intrinsic importance difficulty subject power elegance technical methods employed clear purity illumination writer's mind felt reader play subject
article terribly difficult reading economist difficult appreciate how scientific aesthetic qualities combined together keynes 1933[citation needed]
ramsey model today acknowledged starting point optimal accumulation theory although importance recognised until many years after first publication
main contributions model firstly initial question ramsey posed how much savings should secondly method analysis intertemporal maximisation optimisation collective individual utility applying techniques dynamic optimisation
tjalling c
koopmans david cass modified ramsey model incorporating dynamic features population growth steady rate harrod-neutral technical progress again steady rate giving birth model named ramsey–cass–koopmans model objective now maximise household's utility function
contribution theory taxation paper ramsey's contribution economic theory elegant concept ramsey pricing
applicable situations regulated monopolist wants maximise consumer surplus whilst same time ensuring costs adequately covered
achieved setting price such markup over marginal cost inversely proportional price elasticity demand good
like predecessor paper published economic journal 1927
ramsey poses question solved beginning article given revenue raised proportionate taxes uses income taxes different uses being possibly different rates how much should these rates adjusted order decrement utility may minimum? ramsey 1927
problem suggested economist arthur pigou paper ramsey's answer problem
truth probability keynes treatise probability 1921 argued against subjective approach epistemic probabilities
keynes subjectivity probabilities doesn't matter much there objective relationship knowledge probabilities knowledge disembodied personal
ramsey article disagrees keynes's approach there difference notions probability physics logic
ramsey probability related disembodied body knowledge related knowledge each individual possesses alone
thus personal beliefs formulated individual knowledge govern probabilities leading notion subjective probability
consequently subjective probabilities inferred observing actions reflect individuals' personal beliefs
ramsey argued degree probability individual attaches particular outcome measured finding odds individual accept betting outcome
ramsey suggested way deriving consistent theory choice under uncertainty isolate beliefs preferences while still maintaining subjective probabilities
despite fact ramsey's work probabilities great importance again no paid any attention until publication theory games economic behavior john von neumann oskar morgenstern 1944 1947 2 nd ed
